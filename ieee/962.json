It is quite thought-provoking to distinguish fake information on the internet as it is often written to deceive users. Compared with many machine learning techniques, deep learning-based techniques are capable of detecting fake news more accurately. Previous review papers were based on data mining and machine learning techniques, scarcely exploring the deep learning techniques for fake news detection. However, emerging deep learning-based approaches such as Attention, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers are absent from previous surveys. This study attempts to investigate advanced and state-of-the-art fake news detection mechanisms pensively. We begin with highlighting the fake news consequences. Then, we proceed with the discussion on the dataset used in previous research and their NLP techniques. A comprehensive overview of deep learning-based techniques has been bestowed to organize representative methods into various categories. The prominent evaluation metrics in fake news detection are also discussed. Nevertheless, we suggest further recommendations to improve fake news detection mechanisms in future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129329","startPage":"156151","endPage":"156170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09620068.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Review on Fake News Detection With Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Review on Fake News Detection With Deep Learning","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9620068/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620068/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Comprehensive Review on Fake News Detection With Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"access-rahman-3129329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.480517S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9620068","onlineDate":"18 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9620124,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Gao","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37089167011"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2437-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2436-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2438-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9620124","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Atmospheric modeling","Manuals","Feature extraction","Data models","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault diagnosis","sound classification","Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","bidirectional long short-term memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620124","abstract":"The air conditioner sound classification model can automatically identify abnormal sound of air conditioners, which is more efficient than the manual method in judging the quality of air conditioners. The key to sound classification is that the extracted features must have enough discrimination for different sound types. At the same time, the network used should conform to the characteristics of the data as much as possible. In this paper, a new classification model of air conditioner sound is proposed based on three types of sound data in SDU-Haier-ND data set. Firstly, the Mel spectral features and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients of sound signals are extracted to form joint features. Then, the training feature set is input into bidirectional long short-term memory network for model training. Finally, the trained model is used to classify the test feature set. The experimental results show that the model has good classification ability.","doi":"10.1109/CRC52766.2021.9620124","startPage":"322","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Control, Robotics and Cybernetics (CRC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRC52766.2021.9620124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620111","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Control, Robotics and Cybernetics (CRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620057/9620111/09620124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Air Conditioner Sound Based on Mel Joint Features and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620124/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Air Conditioner Sound Based on Mel Joint Features and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9620124/","publicationDate":"9 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Air Conditioner Sound Based on Mel Joint Features and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CRC62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050852S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620057","isNumber":"9620111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620057","xplore-issue":"9620111","articleId":"9620124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9620192,"authors":[{"name":"Nouar AlDahoul","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia","Yo-Vivo Corporation, Philippines"],"firstName":"Nouar","lastName":"AlDahoul","id":"37087232942"},{"name":"Hezerul Abdul Karim","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hezerul Abdul","lastName":"Karim","id":"38579061000"},{"name":"Mhd Adel Momo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia","Yo-Vivo Corporation, Philippines"],"firstName":"Mhd Adel","lastName":"Momo","id":"37088999520"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2601-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2600-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2602-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9620192","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Support vector machines","Image recognition","Satellites","Orbits","Sensors","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural network","spacecraft recognition","space situational awareness","multimodal learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620192","abstract":"Spacecraft recognition is a significant component of space situational awareness (SSA), especially for applications such as active debris removal, on-orbit servicing, and satellite formation. The complexity of recognition in actual space imagery is caused by a large diversity in sensing conditions, including background noise, low signal-to-noise ratio, different orbital scenarios, and high contrast. This paper addresses the previous problem and proposes multimodal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spacecraft detection and classification. The proposed solution includes two models: 1) a pre-trained ResNet50 CNN connected to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification of RGB images. 2) an end-to-end CNN for classification of depth images. The experiments conducted on a novel SPARK dataset was generated under a realistic space simulation environment and has 150k of RGB images and 150k of depth images with 11 categories. The results show high performance of the proposed solution in terms of accuracy (89 %), F1 score (87 %), and Perf metric (1.8).","doi":"10.1109/ICIPC53495.2021.9620192","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620056/9620177/09620192.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing Challenges (ICIPC)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing Challenges (ICIPC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPC53495.2021.9620192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RGB-D Based Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks for Spacecraft Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"RGB-D Based Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks for Spacecraft Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9620192/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012024","fundingName":"Multimedia University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RGB-D Based Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks for Spacecraft Recognition","confLoc":"AK, USA","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056588S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620056","isNumber":"9620177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620056","xplore-issue":"9620177","articleId":"9620192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9620305,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089167595"},{"name":"Zhaojie Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhaojie","lastName":"Li","id":"37089174069"},{"name":"Heqing Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Heqing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089166251"},{"name":"Xu Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37089174485"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37089165518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3867-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1149-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-7541"}],"articleNumber":"9620305","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Power demand","Memory management","Object detection","Throughput","Energy efficiency","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","accelerator","low power consumption","versatility"]}],"abstract":"As convolutional neural network (CNN) achieves better results than traditional algorithms in applications such as style transfer, target detection, CNN has become a research focus in the field of computer vision.

Simulation results show that a 104.6dB dynamic range of this ADC for wide measuring range is achieved at a frame rate of 50Hz.","doi":"10.1109/ASICON52560.2021.9620349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASICON52560.2021.9620349","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 14th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620208/9620199/09620349.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 14th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Time-of-Flight Image Sensor with High Dynamic Range Digital Pixel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Time-of-Flight Image Sensor with High Dynamic Range Digital Pixel","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"26 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9620349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620349/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Time-of-Flight Image Sensor with High Dynamic Range Digital Pixel","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"P1-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054673S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620208","isNumber":"9620199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620208","xplore-issue":"9620199","articleId":"9620349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9620361,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanfa Wang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanfa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089173547"},{"name":"Yu Pang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Pang","id":"37531995000"},{"name":"Huan Huang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089173274"},{"name":"Qianneng Zhou","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qianneng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089167285"},{"name":"Jiasai Luo","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jiasai","lastName":"Luo","id":"37089171118"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3867-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1149-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-7541"}],"articleNumber":"9620361","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"abstract":"High-performance implementation of non-linear support vector machine (SVM) function is important in many applications.

The designed Gaussian kernel function consists of Norm unit and exponentiation function unit. The Norm unit uses fewer subtractors and multiplexers. The exponentiation function unit performs modified coordinate rotation digital computer algorithm with wide range of convergence and high accuracy. The presented circuit is implemented on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed circuit achieves low resource utilization and high efficiency with relative error 0.0001.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Multiplexing","Digital computers","Conferences","Hardware","Classification algorithms","Resource management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASICON52560.2021.9620361","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 14th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 14th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620208/9620199/09620361.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASICON52560.2021.9620361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Design of Gaussian Kernel Function for Non-Linear SVM Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Design of Gaussian Kernel Function for Non-Linear SVM Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620361/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9620361/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007957","fundingName":"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Design of Gaussian Kernel Function for Non-Linear SVM Classification","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"A2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049813S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620208","isNumber":"9620199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620208","xplore-issue":"9620199","articleId":"9620361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9620385,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37086275845"},{"name":"Mingjie Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mingjie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089166942"},{"name":"Guoyong Shi","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guoyong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3867-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1149-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-755X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-7541"}],"articleNumber":"9620385","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620385","abstract":"We present circuit design methods based on an open-source circuit simulator (Memr-SPICE) for implementing CMOS-memristive neural networks.

coordinated multipoint (JT-CoMP) wireless terminals with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) cellular network. A total of ten (10) terminals were structured. Stochastic analysis of the scheme's impact with anticipated estimations of its inherent network variation challenges within the confined spectrum-sharing zone is conducted and mitigated. We then introduced four (4) novel GUEs-BSs terminal communication protocols to orchestrate communication among the deployed component terminals. The four communication protocols are the single-hop (direct), the multihop, the selective-decode-and-forward (SDP), and the incremental-decode-and-forward (IDF) protocol models. The proposed multi-UAV uplink-downlink (UL-DL) model is later deployed into direct-dense and relay-dense network environments to ascertain its robustness. As depicted, the model's performance evaluation validates antenna gain, low transmission power and improved normalized throughput in both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9620776/","displayDocTitle":"Jointly Coordinated GUE-to-BS Multipoint Terminals in Dense Multi-UAV C-NOMA Network Environment","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Information Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP), South Korea","grantNumber":"IITP-2020-2020-0-01612"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly Coordinated GUE-to-BS Multipoint Terminals in Dense Multi-UAV C-NOMA Network Environment","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1E-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081975S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9620776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9620802,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh Dai Vu","affiliation":["Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Dinh Dai","lastName":"Vu","id":"37089182965"},{"name":"Xuan Tuong Vu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Xuan Tuong","lastName":"Vu","id":"37088748227"},{"name":"Younghan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Younghan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280933000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2383-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2384-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1233"}],"articleNumber":"9620802","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620802","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Deep learning","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Data models","Information and communication technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","fault prediction","Bi-LSTM"]}],"abstract":"A cloud system typically contains a huge number of computing nodes with numerous services running on. Nodes can fail in practice, leading to the downtime of services, hence, the reliability of cloud service is a crucial issue for cloud service providers. To make the cloud environment more reliable, predicting the failure before it already happens is important. The ability to predict faulty nodes enables the migration of service to the healthy nodes, therefore improving service availability. Proactive fault prediction techniques with deep learning methods that are based on historical metrics (such as CPU usage, memory usage, etc) to predict future failures can be used to solve effectively this problem. In this paper, we propose to use the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model for predicting the failure-proneness of nodes in a cluster based on time series data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9620802","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620727/9620211/09620802.pdf","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1829","doi":"10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9620802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-based fault prediction in cloud system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-based fault prediction in cloud system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9620802/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620802/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)","grantNumber":"IITP-2021-2017-0-01633"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-based fault prediction in cloud system","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"8F-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077228S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9620802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9620804,"authors":[{"name":"Thien Huynh-The","affiliation":["ICT Convergence Research Center, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Korea"],"firstName":"Thien","lastName":"Huynh-The","id":"37085558739"},{"name":"Quoc-Viet Pham","affiliation":["Korean Southeast Center for the 4th Industrial Revolution Leader Education, Pusan National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Quoc-Viet","lastName":"Pham","id":"37085874161"},{"name":"Toan-Van Nguyen","affiliation":["Hongik University, Korea"],"firstName":"Toan-Van","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086827605"},{"name":"Xuan-Qui Pham","affiliation":["ICT Convergence Research Center, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Korea"],"firstName":"Xuan-Qui","lastName":"Pham","id":"37089182658"},{"name":"Dong-Seong Kim","affiliation":["ICT Convergence Research Center, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Seong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068067600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2383-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2384-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1233"}],"articleNumber":"9620804","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620804","abstract":"This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to blindly identify the modulations of multi-carrier signals in wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communications.

Autoregressive Neural Network for Interference Prediction and Resource Allocation in URLLC Scenarios","abstract":"Ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) is a new service class introduced in 5G which is characterized by strict reliability (1\u201310\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22125</sup>\n) and low latency requirements (1 ms). To meet these requisites, several strategies like overprovisioning of resources and channel-predictive algorithms have been developed. This paper describes the application of a Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NARNN) as a novel approach to forecast interference levels in a wireless system for the purpose of efficient resource allocation. Accurate interference forecasts also grant the possibility of meeting specific outage probability requirements in URLLC scenarios. Performance of this proposal is evaluated upon the basis of NARNN predictions accuracy and system resource usage. Our proposed approach achieved a promising mean absolute percentage error of 7.8 % on interference predictions and also reduced the resource usage in up to 15 % when compared to a recently proposed interference prediction algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620845/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9620845/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network for Interference Prediction and Resource Allocation in URLLC Scenarios","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"318927"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network for Interference Prediction and Resource Allocation in URLLC Scenarios","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1B-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04929S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9620845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9620878,"authors":[{"name":"Ha-Lim Song","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ha-Lim","lastName":"Song","id":"37086947221"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["The School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2383-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2384-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1233"}],"articleNumber":"9620878","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement errors","Array signal processing","Millimeter wave technology","Packet loss","Time-varying channels","Reliability engineering","Information and communication technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV communication","adaptive beamforming","beam alignment","beam pattern"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620878","doi":"10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9620878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9620878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620211","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620727/9620211/09620878.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Design for Angular Dynamics in High-Speed Mobility","abstract":"The millimeter-wave band communication system implements a sharp beam through a massive antenna array to mitigate extreme path attenuation.

In CRN, spectrum sensing is of high interest that cannot be achieved by a single user due to the multi-path and shadowing effects. Therefore, more than one users take the sensing responsibility cooperatively to better estimate the PU channel. The fusion center (FC) receives local sensing statistics reported by all cooperative users and combines them to reach a common global decision. Since the SUs located distance apart experiences different channel conditions, therefore, it is necessary to deal with the incoming data received from these SUs differently. The proposed scheme intelligently tries to find optimum weighting coefficients against cooperative user's information and utilize these weights in the global decision of the soft decision fusion (SDF). The genetic algorithm (GA) scheme proposed in the paper can find reliable sensing weights against the users sensing data that produces minimum false alarm with high detection probability and reduce the error probability. The simulations performed at different levels of the signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) and a total number of cooperative users result in better sensing response for the proposed GA scheme against maximum gain combination (MGC), Kullback Leibler (KL), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9620891/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9620891/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sensing Weight Selection using the Genetic Algorithm to Enhance Cooperative Decision","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"2021R1A2C1013150"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing Weight Selection using the Genetic Algorithm to Enhance Cooperative Decision","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"3A-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05965S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9620891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9620923,"authors":[{"name":"Fabliha Bushra Islam","affiliation":["Networked Systems Lab., IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Fabliha Bushra","lastName":"Islam"},{"name":"Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma","affiliation":["Networked Systems Lab., IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Cosmas Ifeanyi","lastName":"Nwakanma"},{"name":"Jae-Min Lee","affiliation":["Networked Systems Lab., IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Min","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Dong-Seong Kim","affiliation":["Networked Systems Lab., IT Convergence Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Gyeongbuk, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Seong","lastName":"Kim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2383-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2384-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1233"}],"articleNumber":"9620923","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9620923","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19, has brought untold hardship and deaths all over the world.

Also, in terms of the detection performance, the unsupervised learning method is generally not as good as the supervised learning method. Nevertheless, it is difficult to acquire the labeled network traffic data in real world.

Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging on human epithelial type-2 cells (HEp-2) is the gold standard for the ANA test. Accurate Human Epithelial-2 (HEp-2) cell classification plays an essential role in the diagnosis of immune system diseases. Developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for ANA analysis is necessary for improving the disease diagnosis and treatment planning of the patients. Traditionally, cell patterns are assessed manually with a fluorescence microscope. However, due to the large variations of cell patterns, manual interpretation of the cell images is time-consuming, highly subjective and also requires experienced experts. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based ensemble model of Inception V3and Xception architectures for the task of HEp-2 cell images classification as either healthy or case subjects. In intuition, the aggregation of different architectures can effectively extract and fuse the most discriminative deep features from input images. Also, we use a transfer learning strategy and hyper-parameter tuning to further improve the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ensemble model achieves promising results with an accuracy of 95.07%, sensitivity of 99.96% and specificity of 99.79% in comparison with state-of-the-art models on the ICPR 2012 benchmark dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621075","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620727/9620211/09621075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HEp-2 Cell Classification Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Adaptation models","Transfer learning","Computer architecture","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer-aided diagnosis","Convolutional neural network","Deep learning","HEp-2 cell classification","Transfer learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"HEp-2 Cell Classification Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9621075/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HEp-2 Cell Classification Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1B-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072308S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9621075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9621098,"authors":[{"name":"Haesik Kim","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Haesik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37599629100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2383-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2384-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-1233"}],"articleNumber":"9621098","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Recurrent neural networks","5G mobile communication","Spectral efficiency","OFDM","Interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal recovery techniques","Interference mitigation","Machine learning","Recursive neural networks","5G and 6G systems","etc"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621098","abstract":"The interference management is getting more important in 5G and beyond 5G systems because cell density increases significantly and multiple types of cells are considered. High interferences significantly degrade the spectral efficiency as well as energy efficiency. The interference mitigation techniques will be the main research challenges in 5G and beyond 5G heterogeneous networks. Deep learning is one of new bloods in beyond 5G system. Many research groups are investigating to apply deep learning in physical layer and network layer. We expect to improve the network performance as well as create new services in beyond 5G systems. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable for predicting data in time sequence. In this paper, a novel signal recovery technique using RNN is proposed for mitigating interferences. The purpose of the proposed algorithm is to recover the received signals that are wiped out by interference. The performances of the proposed technique are evaluated and analyzed. In the simulation, we predicted the lost 50 subcarriers of OFDM channel estimation symbols. After having enough training of LSTM network, we obtained the RMSE value 0.24596 between the predicted value and the observed value.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621098","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620727/9620211/09621098.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Recovery Technique Using Recurrent Neural Network in Interference Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Signal Recovery Technique Using Recurrent Neural Network in Interference Environment","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9621098/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621098/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Recovery Technique Using Recurrent Neural Network in Interference Environment","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"1B-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039202S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9621098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9621174,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Particularly, a traditional beam allocation scheme degrades the beam training performance due to a non-convex optimization problem, which contain a combinatorial number of local optima and make them extremely challenging for conventional solvers. Hence, we propose a vision-aided beam allocation scheme to overcome the beam optimization issue and enhance the beam training performance in this paper. We employ a camera at the mmWave access point and leverage their scene information to spontaneously sort out the best allocated beam. We also exploit a machine learning tool to predict the allocated mmWave beam from the camera RGB scene. The simulation results show the performance of the proposed vision-aided solutions in terms of beam training and testing performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Visualization","Machine learning","Tools","Cameras","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vision-aided mmWave indoor communications","beam allocation scheme","machine learning","accuracy and loss performance"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9620211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621174","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1408","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9620727/9620211/09621174.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Aided Beam Allocation for Indoor mmWave Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vision-Aided Beam Allocation for Indoor mmWave Communications","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9621174/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Aided Beam Allocation for Indoor mmWave Communications","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"8C-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0546S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9620727","isNumber":"9620211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9620727","xplore-issue":"9620211","articleId":"9621174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9621217,"authors":[{"name":"Prasenjit Maji","affiliation":["Bengal College of Engineering and Technology, Durgapur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9621217/maji-3129316-small.gif","p":["Prasenjit Maji received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science and engineering from the West Bengal University of Technology in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) technique is commonly used for heart disease diagnosis. Doctors can measure pulse and other heart boundaries with the aid of it. Fast and precise detection of forms of arrhythmia is critical while identifying heart disease. In this work, we proposed an intelligent ECG device (called iKardo) with the built-in automatic capability to classify into critical and non-critical data from an imbalanced ECG dataset for the smart IoT or Internet of Things based smart healthcare device. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of data misclassification by converting imbalanced data into a balanced dataset using necessary techniques. This proposed iKardo helps in the accurate detection of critical ECG beats with an accuracy of 99.58% and result in a smart healthcare monitoring device that would make the disease detection fast and

Recently, several research groups have demonstrated that matrix-vector multiplication can be performed analytically in a single time step with an electronic circuit that incorporates an open-loop memristor crossbar that is effectively a resistive random-access memory. Ielmini and co-workers have taken this a step further by demonstrating that linear algebraic systems can also be solved in a single time step using similar hardware with feedback. These two approaches can both be applied to Markov chains, in the first case using matrix-vector multiplication to compute successive updates to a discrete Markov process and in the second directly calculating the stationary distribution by solving a constrained eigenvector problem. We present circuit models for open-loop and feedback configurations, and perform detailed analyses that include memristor programming errors, thermal noise sources and element nonidealities in realistic circuit simulations to determine both the precision and accuracy of the analog solutions. We provide mathematical tools to formally describe the trade-offs in the circuit model between power consumption and the magnitude of errors. We compare the two approaches by analyzing Markov chains that lead to two different types of matrices, essentially random and ill-conditioned, and observe that ill-conditioned matrices suffer from significantly larger errors. We compare our analog results to those from digital computations and find a significant power efficiency advantage for the crossbar approach for similar precision results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126477","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126477","startPage":"4910","endPage":"4923","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09621318.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621318/","displayDocTitle":"Analog Solutions of Discrete Markov Chains via Memristor Crossbars","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9621318/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca (MIUR)","grantNumber":"2017LSCR4K-003"},{"fundingName":"X-Grants Program of the President\u2019s Excellence Fund at Texas A&M University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Solutions of Discrete Markov Chains via Memristor Crossbars","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zoppo-3126477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096292S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9621318","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9621393,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Gao","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37089178106"},{"name":"Chunsun Tian","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chunsun","lastName":"Tian","id":"37087057098"},{"name":"Zhou Fang","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Fang","id":"37087140061"},{"name":"Wei Cui","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37087060067"},{"name":"Ze Gao","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Gao","id":"37087061362"},{"name":"Chenghao Li","affiliation":["Grid Technology Center Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Henan Electric Power Corporation, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chenghao","lastName":"Li","id":"37087062352"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3498-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3497-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3499-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9621393","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"abstract":"When the low-frequency power oscillation occurs in the power system, dispatchers often adopt the emergency control method of reducing output and load to suppress the oscillation as soon as possible, so as to maintain the stability of the system.

A novel predictive method for dissolved gas content in transformer oil based on temporal convolutional network (TCN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed in this paper. First, a Temporal Convolutional Network based on dilated causal convolution algorithm is designed to extract feature information from both current data and historical data of each gas content. Since the correlation coefficients among different gases may affect the accuracy of the prediction, a topological structure diagram is constructed to describe the relationship among different gases. Then, a GCN is designed to predict the gas content in the desired time horizon by using the information obtained from the topological structure diagram. The elements in the adjacency matrix of GCN are replaced by Pearson correlation coefficients to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The test results show that the proposed method in this paper achieves high accuracy for the prediction of dissolved gas content in transformer oil. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the predicted gas content by the proposed method is reduced by 11.18% compared with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and 12.23% compared with the traditional Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621524/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9621524/","publicationDate":"18 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction for Dissolved Gas in Power Transformer Oil Based on Temporal Convolutional and Graph Convolutional Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013096","fundingName":"Science and Technology Project of State Grid"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction for Dissolved Gas in Power Transformer Oil Based on Temporal Convolutional and Graph Convolutional Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICPS-ASIA21_201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100004S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9621343","isNumber":"9621368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9621343","xplore-issue":"9621368","articleId":"9621524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9621525,"authors":[{"name":"Yaobang Chen","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yaobang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Jie Shi","affiliation":["School of Physic and Technology, University of Jinan, Ji\u2019nan, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Xingong Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Jinan, Ji\u2019nan, China"],"firstName":"Xingong","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Xiaoyi Ma","affiliation":["Dongying Power Supply Company, State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company, Dongying, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Ma"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3498-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3497-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3499-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9621525","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621525","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photovoltaic systems","Predictive models","Benchmark testing","Hybrid power systems","Bayes methods","Convolutional neural networks","Forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting","Hybrid models","Neural network","Bayesian optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621525","pdfPath":"/iel7/9621343/9621368/09621525.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9621368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Models Based on LSTM and CNN Architecture with Bayesian Optimization for ShortTerm Photovoltaic Power Forecasting","abstract":"The precision and reliability of photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting play a crucial role in commercial PV plants.

It is demonstrated that the proposed RVMM algorithm exhibits better performance in the clustering validity evaluation and a higher accuracy is achieved by random forest classifier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9621368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621531","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9621343/9621368/09621531.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","doi":"10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Load Pattern Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Load Pattern Identification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9621531/","publicationDate":"18 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621531/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010880","fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Load Pattern Identification","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICPS-ASIA21_101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102415S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9621343","isNumber":"9621368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9621343","xplore-issue":"9621368","articleId":"9621531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9621540,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Hui Hou","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Hou"},{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Leiqi Zhang","affiliation":["State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Leiqi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xixiu Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xixiu","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Changjun Xie","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Changjun","lastName":"Xie"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3498-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3497-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3499-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9621540","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621540","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Load forecasting","Simulation","Power system dynamics","Training data","Weather forecasting","Machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaos theory","phase space reconstruction","LSTM","permutation entropy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621540","pdfPath":"/iel7/9621343/9621368/09621540.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia)","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9621368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Forecasting Combining Chaos Theory and Long-Short Term Memory in Absence of Key Information","abstract":"Power load forecasting used to rely on some key data such as weather information and regional information. However, it is usually difficult to obtain accurate data of all influencing factors. For this reason, we adopted phase space reconstruction of chaos theory to process the historical load series to avoid collecting some key data. To forecast ahead of time and solve the divergence of forecasting error caused by forecasting ahead of time, this paper proposes a rolling load forecasting method and apply long-short term memory (LSTM) to solve them. The rolling forecasting method is to predict a forecast length in advance, and the test data of LSTM is obtained by shifting a forecast length of training data. This method can not only predict ahead, but also predict the longer-term data through keeping shifting. The proposed methodology is implemented on the PJM power grid dataset in the United States. Compared with some other methods, the results show that the proposed rolling load forecasting model is of more accurate prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621540/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9621540/","publicationDate":"18 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Load Forecasting Combining Chaos Theory and Long-Short Term Memory in Absence of Key Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Forecasting Combining Chaos Theory and Long-Short Term Memory in Absence of Key Information","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICPS-ASIA21_279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080481S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9621343","isNumber":"9621368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9621343","xplore-issue":"9621368","articleId":"9621540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9621586,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Solar Energy Utilization & Energy Saving Technology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China","Zhejiang Energy Research Institute Co.

However, due to the system delays, the damping region is only up to one sixth of the sampling frequency $(f_{\\mathrm{s}}/6)$, leading to a limited robustness against grid impedance variation. To resolve this problem, an enhanced active damping method is proposed with proportional-resonant-differential inverter-side current feedback, where the proportional-differential term serves as a delay-compensation link. Then, two modified digital implementation schemes of proportional-differential term are given to overcome the gain amplification problem at Nyquist frequency. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed active damping method can successfully extend the damping region to approximately $(0,f_{\\mathrm{s}}/4)$ and improve the system robustness. Finally, experimental results on a 30 kVA APF prototype have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9621586/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","publicationDate":"18 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Active Damping Control Method for LCL-Type Shunt APFs with Proportional-Resonant-Differential Inverter-Side Current Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Active Damping Control Method for LCL-Type Shunt APFs with Proportional-Resonant-Differential Inverter-Side Current Feedback","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICPS-ASIA21_156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073457S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9621343","isNumber":"9621368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9621343","xplore-issue":"9621368","articleId":"9621586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9621621,"authors":[{"name":"Haitham Kanakri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN"],"firstName":"Haitham","lastName":"Kanakri","id":"37085386038"},{"name":"Euzeli Cipriano Dos Santos","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN"],"firstName":"Euzeli Cipriano Dos","lastName":"Santos","id":"37286173700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2928-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2929-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2381-2842"}],"articleNumber":"9621621","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Photovoltaic systems","Renewable energy sources","Multilevel converters","Wind energy","Inverters","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dc-ac power converter","power block geometry (PBG)","model predictive control (MPC)","neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621621","doi":"10.1109/EPEC52095.2021.9621621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC52095.2021.9621621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9621363","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference (EPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference (EPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9621301/9621363/09621621.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control of Multi-Level Neutral Point Clamp (NPC) Grid-Connected Inverter Using Power Block Geometry (PBG) Approach","abstract":"In a grid connected renewable energy systems, where multiple DC power sources supply current to the grid, controlling the injected current is an important issue. When considering renewable energy resources, such as photovoltaic (PV), multi-level converters are needed to convert the DC power to AC power suitable for the grid with less harmonic distortion. Since different sources may have different power delivery levels model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to control the neutral-point clamp (NPC) inverter to regulate the injected power to the grid. Further, since there are numerous power electronics converters topologies used to solve this problem the power block geometry (PBG) is proposed to facilitate the analysis of multi-level converters and the design of MPC controller. This paper presents a model-predictive control-based on power block geometry method, single-phase and three-phase NPC inverters based MPC are simulated in MATLAB, to control the injected current into the grid. The power block geometry speeds up both analysis of the four-level NPC inverter and the MPC design since it is based on geometrical representation with specific rules that establishes a formation law.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9621621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-31 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-31 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9621621/","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control of Multi-Level Neutral Point Clamp (NPC) Grid-Connected Inverter Using Power Block Geometry (PBG) Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control of Multi-Level Neutral Point Clamp (NPC) Grid-Connected Inverter Using Power Block Geometry (PBG) Approach","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570744280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092097S","chronDate":"22-31 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9621301","isNumber":"9621363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9621301","xplore-issue":"9621363","articleId":"9621621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9621650,"authors":[{"name":"Uzair Zaman","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Uzair","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37089166219"},{"name":"Hamid Teimourzadeh","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Teimourzadeh","id":"37088653209"},{"name":"Elias Hassani Sangani","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Elias Hassani","lastName":"Sangani","id":"37089172271"},{"name":"Xiaodong Liang","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406457300"},{"name":"Chi Yung Chung","affiliation":["University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"firstName":"Chi Yung","lastName":"Chung","id":"37276895100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2928-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2929-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2381-2842"}],"articleNumber":"9621650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Wind speed","Computational modeling","Predictive models","Wind power generation","Data models","Power grids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","autoregressive moving average","gated recurrent unit","wind speed foresting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9621650","abstract":"With the advancement of wind power generation technology, wind power plays an increasing role in modern power grids.

One prominent challenge is to implement efficient anomaly detection for different types of anomalous behaviors within power grids. These anomalous behaviors might be induced by unusual consumption patterns of the users, faulty grid infrastructures, outages, external cyberattacks, or energy fraud. Identifying such anomalies is of critical importance for the reliable and efficient operation of modern power grids. Various methods have been proposed for anomaly detection on power grid time-series data.

There is a large amount of heterogeneous radar data from the polar regions that have been gathered through expensive missions. However, retrieving meaningful information from this large volume of data is still a great challenge. With the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, many scientists are eager to take advantage of these algorithms and techniques to explore and mine Arctic and Antarctic data. These advancements, however, have happened mainly in the area of supervised learning where the models are data hungry and require large amounts of annotated data. Generating simulated data can be an effective and inexpensive approach to provide large labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this work, we explore two approaches to simulate arctic snow radar echogram images, namely a radar scattering physics based approach combined with some statistical measures and a purely data-driven approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Using several image comparison metrics, we analyze the utility of both methods for the purpose of simulating echograms. Our results show that the physics simulator generates images with good structural similarities, while the purely data-driven approach achieves better textural similarities for simulated image. Finally, we also show that by augmenting our real dataset by the simulated echograms, we can improve our deep learning model for tracking internal layers of snow.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9314330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/9314330/09622135.pdf","startPage":"12035","endPage":"12047","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airborne Snow Radar Data Simulation With Deep Learning and Physics-Driven Methods","topic":"IEEE 2020 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2020)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Airborne Snow Radar Data Simulation With Deep Learning and Physics-Driven Methods","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/9622135/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF BIGDATA","grantNumber":"IIS-1838230 and IIS-1947584"},{"fundingName":"NSF HDR Institute","grantNumber":"OAC-2118285"},{"fundingName":"IBM"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016443","fundingName":"Amazon Catalyst"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Airborne Snow Radar Data Simulation With Deep Learning and Physics-Driven Methods","sourcePdf":"jstars-yari-3126547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18598S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"9314330","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","xplore-issue":"9314330","topics":["IEEE 2020 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2020)"],"articleId":"9622135","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9622171,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["Yangtze Delta Region Institute Quzhou, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Quzhou, Zhejiang, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9622171/wang-3129364-small.gif","p":["Zhen Wang (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

According to the local sensor quantization strategies and fusion strategies, this paper discusses three methods: quantize local test statistics which are linearly fused (QTLF), quantize local test statistics which are optimally fused (QTOF), and quantize local received signals which are optimally fused (QROF). We first directly analyze the detection performance of each method when the quantizer output is represented as a discrete random variable, where it is difficult to obtain a closed-form expression for the detection probability. Then, an approximate description for the quantization is analyzed for the case of a Gaussian signal and a closed-form expression for the detection probability is obtained. We prove that the QTOF method outperforms the QTLF method in general, and for small SCNR the QROF method has the best detection performance among the three methods, while for large SCNR the QROF method performs the worst. The correctness of theoretical analysis is verified by simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","MIMO radar","Cloud computing","Receivers","Object detection","Radar detection","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud MIMO radar","quantization","detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3129364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09622171.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3129364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target Detection Using Quantized Cloud MIMO Radar Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9622171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Target Detection Using Quantized Cloud MIMO Radar Measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622171/","volume":"70","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9622171/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Municipal Government of Quzhou","grantNumber":"2021D005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Detection Using Quantized Cloud MIMO Radar Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsp-he-3129364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136991S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9622171","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9622179,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Kay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Kay","orcid":"0000-0002-9267-8040"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9622179","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction for Signal Detection","abstract":"A new approach to the problem of dimensionality reduction is proposed. The specific application is to the detection of signals in noise, although it should be applicable to other signal processing problems of current interest. Using a minimum mean square error estimator of the likelihood ratio one can determine a low dimensional statistic, not necessarily linear in the data, that performs well for detection, i.e., with minimal loss of information. If a sufficient statistic does exist for the problem then the proposed approach yields the well known result that one should use the likelihood ratio of the sufficient statistic for detection. Other interesting relationships are explored and some specific examples are given.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3129453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3129453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09622179.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9622179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Mean square error methods","Gaussian noise","Dimensionality reduction","Bayes methods","Standards","Manifolds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal detection","principal component analysis","inference algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction for Signal Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9622179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622179/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensionality Reduction for Signal Detection","sourcePdf":"lsp-kay-3129453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028052S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9622179","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9622183,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China","Frontiers Science Center for Smart High-Speed Railway System, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9622183/jzhang-3129337-small.gif","p":["Jiayi Zhang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China in 2014.

Due to the strong macro diversity gain, cell-free massive MIMO can considerably improve the achievable sum-rate compared to conventional cellular massive MIMO. However, the performance of cell-free massive MIMO is upper limited by inter-user interference (IUI) when employing simple maximum ratio combining (MRC) at receivers. To harness IUI, the expanded compute-and-forward (ECF) framework is adopted. In particular, we propose power control algorithms for the parallel computation and successive computation in the ECF framework, respectively, to exploit the performance gain and then improve the system performance. Furthermore, we propose an AP selection scheme and the application of different decoding orders for the successive computation. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that ECF frameworks outperform the conventional CF and MRC frameworks in terms of achievable sum-rate.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3129337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3129337","startPage":"202","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09622183.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Sum-Rate of Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Expanded Compute-and-Forward","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Improving Sum-Rate of Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Expanded Compute-and-Forward","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9622183/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622183/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971027, U1834210 and 61961130391"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"L202013"},{"fundingName":"Frontiers Science Center for Smart High-speed Railway System"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship","grantNumber":"NA191006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China","grantNumber":"2020JBZD005"},{"fundingName":"Project of China Shenhua","grantNumber":"GJNY-20-01-1"},{"fundingName":"UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, UNSW, Sydney"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP210102169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Sum-Rate of Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Expanded Compute-and-Forward","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-3129337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103532S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9622183","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":9622190,"authors":[{"name":"Junhao Xu","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/9289074/9622190/xu-3129357-small.gif","p":["Junhao Xu received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2018.

Low-bit neural network quantization provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their model size. Current quantization methods are based on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different parts of LMs to quantization errors. To this end, novel mixed precision neural network LM quantization methods are proposed in this paper. The optimal local precision choices for LSTM-RNN and Transformer based neural LMs are automatically learned using three techniques. The first two approaches are based on quantization sensitivity metrics in the form of either the KL-divergence measured between full precision and quantized LMs, or Hessian trace weighted quantization perturbation that can be approximated efficiently using matrix free techniques. The third approach is based on mixed precision neural architecture search. In order to overcome the difficulty in using gradient descent methods to directly estimate discrete quantized weights, alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) are used to efficiently train quantized LMs. Experiments were conducted on state-of-the-art LF-MMI CNN-TDNN systems featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation on two tasks: Switchboard telephone speech and AMI meeting transcription. The proposed mixed precision quantization techniques achieved \u201clossless\u201d quantization on both tasks, by producing model size compression ratios of up to approximately 16 times over the full precision LSTM and Transformer baseline LMs, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate increase.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2021.3129357","startPage":"3679","endPage":"3693","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2021.3129357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9289074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/9289074/09622190.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed Precision Low-Bit Quantization of Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622190/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mixed Precision Low-Bit Quantization of Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/9622190/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council GRF","grantNumber":"14200218, 14200220 and 14200021"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010428","fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"ITS/254/19"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006355","fundingName":"Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering","grantNumber":"MMT-p1-19"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed Precision Low-Bit Quantization of Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"taslp-xu-3129357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165825S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"9289074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","xplore-issue":"9289074","articleId":"9622190","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9622192,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"9622192","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory information for authors","abstract":"These instructions give guidelines for preparing papers for this publication.

In the real field, the PHM for the system is more important, which deals with the exploration of the system health derived from components degradations, from which the decision can be made to which components to repair. While there have been few recent studies in this direction, no studies are found that have investigated this issue from the systems perspective. Motivated by this, appropriate architecture for the system-level PHM is proposed for the physics-based and data-driven approaches. The architecture is demonstrated using a direct current (DC) motor system, which addresses the system health by the degradation of two components: bearing and permanent magnet. Due to the lack of real field data, simulation data are made using the motor dynamic equation. The two approaches are compared from the perspective of model construction and required information. In conclusion, the proposed architecture enables the estimation of components and system health, as well as the prediction of their remaining useful life. Furthermore, a what-if study allows us to investigate how long the system can be operated by repairing each component, from which the optimum maintenance plan can be made.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09622275.pdf","startPage":"157960","endPage":"157972","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study Toward Appropriate Architecture of System-Level Prognostics: Physics-Based and Data-Driven Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Study Toward Appropriate Architecture of System-Level Prognostics: Physics-Based and Data-Driven Approaches","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9622275/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT: MSIT) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"2020R1A4A4079904"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Study Toward Appropriate Architecture of System-Level Prognostics: Physics-Based and Data-Driven Approaches","sourcePdf":"access-choi-3129516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115768S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9622275","onlineDate":"19 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9622361,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Panigrahy","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Satyajit","lastName":"Panigrahy"},{"name":"Subrata Karmakar","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Subrata","lastName":"Karmakar"},{"name":"Rakesh Sahoo","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Sahoo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2849-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2850-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2766-2101"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2334-0940"}],"articleNumber":"9622361","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Deep learning","Electric potential","Neural networks","High-voltage techniques","Insulators","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polymeric Insulator","Image Classification","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Hydrophobicity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9622361","abstract":"An insulator can be characterized as a device used for insulating and holding conductors or equipment which are subject to the difference in electric potential as stated in IEC 60050-471-01-10.

As high chip temperature can cause frequency throttling or shutdown of processor cores at unexpected times, many real-time scheduling techniques have been developed to ensure continuous, fail-safe operation of safety-critical tasks with stringent timing constraints. However, their practical use remains largely limited due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to obtain a precise thermal model of commercial processors without using special measurement instruments or access to proprietary information, such as the power traces of micro-architectural units and detailed floorplans.In this paper, we propose a data-driven structured thermal modeling scheme that is directly applicable to commercial off-the-shelf multi-core processors used in real-time embedded systems. By using a small number of thermal profiles obtained from on-chip temperature sensors, our scheme can accurately predict the processor operating temperature under dynamic real-time workloads at various CPU frequencies and ambient conditions. The thermal model derived from our scheme is fast to converge and robust against different sources of errors. Our scheme is non-intrusive, meaning that it does not require changes to the software code or the hardware packaging of the target system. Furthermore, our scheme can estimate the relative power consumption of the processor for a given workload and clock frequency level. Experimental results from a multi-core ARM platform indicate that our scheme estimates the operating temperature with a maximum error of 2.5% while the latest prior work results in 23% error. This highly accurate modeling enables us to obtain the maximum achievable processor utilization that does not cause a thermal safety violation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9622382/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Structured Thermal Modeling for COTS Multi-Core Processors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Structured Thermal Modeling for COTS Multi-Core Processors","confLoc":"Dortmund, Germany","sourcePdf":"280200a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109656S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622323","isNumber":"9622324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622323","xplore-issue":"9622324","articleId":"9622382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9622556,"authors":[{"name":"Vijaya Kumar B.

With the enormous rise in cyber-attacks in today's world, it becomes imperative to monitor the network packet flow in order to identify attacks by intruders, which otherwise can lead to disruptions and losses in computing resources. These large dimensional and voluminous network packets have to be carefully examined and investigated for network anomalies, and will be a tedious and complicated task. Hence, to make this process simpler, a network anomaly detection model that considers the temporal variations in packet transmissions to identify the threats and to protect these networks against malicious activities is proposed. In this model, we propose a machine learning based anomaly detection system (ADS) that is capable of classifying malicious and benign traffic. At the same time, identifies the time varying patterns by using unsupervised learning that provides the patterns and hidden features in the captured packets. Kohonen's self-organizing map neural network (KSOM-NN) is used as an unsupervised learning method to classify the pre-processed packet features into clusters and thereafter the classification methods are used and verified with the labelled dataset. Similarly, a statistical analysis and a threshold value of packet loss, jitter, and other parameters for normal and anomalous packets are observed for further investigations. Above models were trained and tested with the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Totally the patterns are thoroughly analyzed for anomalies with the help of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Improved performance with respect to anomaly detection rate and accuracy is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622556/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9622556/","publicationDate":"9 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Temporal based Network Packet Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001427","fundingName":"All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) RPS","grantNumber":"8-224/RIFD/ RPS(Policy-1)/2018-19"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal based Network Packet Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"CONECCT2021239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044265S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622410","isNumber":"9622346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622410","xplore-issue":"9622346","articleId":"9622556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9622557,"authors":[{"name":"Manali Raman","affiliation":["BMS College of Engineerng, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Manali","lastName":"Raman","id":"37089178565"},{"name":"V.

SOH prediction of batteries becomes challenging task owing to unpredictable and unknown features which influence battery's health. This paper proposes a data-driven approach for SOH estimation by using the battery ageing datasets of Prognostic Center of Excellence (PCoE) of NASA. SOH estimation requires tracking of long sequential and temporal data of battery aging which exhibit dynamic states. The state of the art algorithm, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), due to its internal memory isappropriate for processing and predicting battery SOH. Hence this work employs different RNN techniques to build battery SOH prediction model, and the results of different techniques are compared and analyzed. The internal modeling parameters are trained by NASA battery datasets, where discharge cycles are introduced for SOH estimation. Experimental results show that RNN techniques can accurately estimate battery SOH.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Heuristic algorithms","NASA","Estimation","Predictive models","Aging","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gated recurrent unit","Long-short term memory","Recurrent neural network","SOH estimation of batteries and stacked RNN techniques"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT52877.2021.9622557","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9622410/9622346/09622557.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT52877.2021.9622557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium Ion Batteries using Recurrent Neural Network and its Variants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium Ion Batteries using Recurrent Neural Network and its Variants","publicationDate":"9 July 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9622557/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State of Health Estimation of Lithium Ion Batteries using Recurrent Neural Network and its Variants","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"CONECCT2021499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111888S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622410","isNumber":"9622346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622410","xplore-issue":"9622346","articleId":"9622557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9622703,"authors":[{"name":"Mukesh B R","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Mukesh B","lastName":"R","id":"37089178891"},{"name":"Tanmai Harish","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Tanmai","lastName":"Harish","id":"37086549598"},{"name":"Veena Mayya","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Veena","lastName":"Mayya","id":"37085900047"},{"name":"Sowmya Kamath S","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sowmya Kamath","lastName":"S","id":"37089017736"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2849-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2850-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2766-2101"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2334-0940"}],"articleNumber":"9622703","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Costs","Retinopathy","Hospitals","Pipelines","Urban areas","Standards organizations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Diabetic Retinopathy Detection","Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","Image Classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9622703","abstract":"Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness across the world as per statistics published by the World Health Organization. Recently, there has been significant research on adopting deep learning methodologies to automate and improve the process of evaluating the advent and progress of chronic eye diseases using eye fundus images. Typically, eye fundus imaging equipment is used by trained specialists for evaluating eye health, however, fundus imaging tends to be expensive, and also the high-end equipment used is typically available in large hospitals and urban areas. This cost barrier leads to an imbalance in care between the developed and developing parts of the world. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive stand-in for such a device and a deep neural model pipeline that is able to analyze these images to determine the need for further evaluation from a trained ophthalmologist. The pipeline is able to achieve an AUC score of 0.9781 in detecting Referable DR. We also benchmark the proposed deep learning pipeline against other pipelines on standard datasets to demonstrate the capability of the network.","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT52877.2021.9622703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT52877.2021.9622703","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9622410/9622346/09622703.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning based detection of Diabetic Retinopathy from Inexpensive fundus imaging techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning based detection of Diabetic Retinopathy from Inexpensive fundus imaging techniques","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2021","publicationDate":"9 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9622703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622703/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning based detection of Diabetic Retinopathy from Inexpensive fundus imaging techniques","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"CONECCT2021545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083118S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622410","isNumber":"9622346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622410","xplore-issue":"9622346","articleId":"9622703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9622750,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Chiaraviglio","affiliation":["University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy","Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9645052/9622750/chiar-3125528-small.gif","p":["Luca Chiaraviglio (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication and electronics engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 2011.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.

With the ever-increasing model size, the DNN scalability suffers. Sparse deep neural networks (SpDNN) are promising to resolve this problem, but the sparse data makes it difficult to execute efficiently on GPUs due to load imbalance and irregular memory accesses. The recent MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge has shown several big advances to fit sparse DNNs into GPUs, but we observe that none of these earlier efforts can be an absolute winner for all dataset cases due to their limited optimization space considerations. In this paper, we identify some new opportunities in optimizing the execution of SpDNN via a comprehensive analysis of previous works. Based on this new large design space of SpDNN, we present sparsity-aware SpMM algorithms that can systematically explore a performance-optimal solution of SpDNN execution on GPU and further generate optimized SpMM kernel implementations. Compared to the 2020 HPEC Sparse DNN Challenge champions, our approach achieves up to 55.6 TeraEdges per second inference throughput with the speedups of up to 13.74_ [1] and 22.29_ [2] on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. We also show that our approach under 4 GPUs can be superior to the 2020 Challenge Champion using 768 GPUs in many cases.

The first one targets spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). It combines lazy- with event-driven plasticity and efficiently facilitates the computation of pre- and post-synaptic spikes using bitfields and integer intrinsics. It offers higher bandwidth than event-driven plasticity alone and achieves a 1.5\u00d7\u20132\u00d7 speedup over our closest competitor. The second optimization targets spike delivery. We partition our graph representation in a way that bounds the number of neurons that need be updated at any given time which allows us to perform said update in shared memory instead of global memory. This is 2\u00d7\u20132.5\u00d7 faster than our closest competitor. Both optimizations represent the final evolutionary stages of years of iteration on STDP and spike delivery inside \"Spice\" (/spaIk/), our state of the art SNN simulator. The proposed optimizations are not exclusive to our graph representation or pipeline but are applicable to a multitude of simulator designs.

Many types of DNNs have been and continue to be developed, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The overall problem for all of these Neural Networks (NNs) is that their target applications generally pose stringent constraints on latency and throughput, while also having strict accuracy requirements. There have been many previous efforts in creating hardware to accelerate NNs. The problem designers face is that optimal NN models typically have significant irregularities, making them hardware-unfriendly. In this paper, we first define the problems in NN acceleration by characterizing common irregularities in NN processing into 4 types; then we summarize the existing works that handle the four types of irregularities efficiently using hardware, especially FPGAs; finally, we provide a new vision of next-generation FPGA-based NN acceleration: that the emerging heterogeneity in the next-generation FPGAs is the key to achieving higher performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622877/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9622877/","publicationDate":"20 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey: Handling Irregularities in Neural Network Acceleration with FPGAs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey: Handling Irregularities in Neural Network Acceleration with FPGAs","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164999S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622740","isNumber":"9622741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622740","xplore-issue":"9622741","articleId":"9622877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9622940,"authors":[{"name":"Xinrui Wang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"],"firstName":"Xinrui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089175950"},{"name":"Yun Lin","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085397030"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4391-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4392-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2767-6684"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2767-6676"}],"articleNumber":"9622940","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Industries","Time series analysis","Fitting","Complex networks","Feature extraction","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data augmentation","electromagnetic signal recognition","Complex neural network","Small sample data","I/ Q complex"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9622940","doi":"10.1109/DSA52907.2021.00049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSA52907.2021.00049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622768","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9622894/9622768/09622940.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small Sample Electromagnetic Signal Recognition based on Time Series Data Augmentation","abstract":"With the rapid development of science, technology and industry, the electromagnetic environment becomes more and more complex. The acquisition of information first needs to identify the signal. However, the number of electromagnetic transmitting equipment is large, and the signal is unstable, which easily leads to a small number of available signal samples. As a result, over fitting is easy to occur in the training process, which reduces the accuracy of recognition. In this paper, the complex network model is used for the electromagnetic signal recognition. Aiming at the problem of less dataset, the time series data augmentation method is used for the processing of this dataset, so as to enhance the accuracy of electromagnetic signal recognition. According to the characteristics of time series, four methods are used to augment the data, including time domain flipping, amplitude inversion, amplitude scaling and noise disturbance. The experimental results display that the four augmentation methods can enhance the recognition accuracy, and the mixed form of different augmentation methods can better enhance the effect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9622940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9622940/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Small Sample Electromagnetic Signal Recognition based on Time Series Data Augmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small Sample Electromagnetic Signal Recognition based on Time Series Data Augmentation","confLoc":"Yinchuan, China","sourcePdf":"439100a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071798S","chronDate":"5-6 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9622894","isNumber":"9622768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9622894","xplore-issue":"9622768","articleId":"9622940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9623008,"authors":[{"name":"Zherui Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University"],"firstName":"Zherui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089167807"},{"name":"Ya Tu","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University"],"firstName":"Ya","lastName":"Tu","id":"37086357563"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4391-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4392-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2767-6684"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2767-6676"}],"articleNumber":"9623008","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Convolution","Neurons","Modulation","Stability analysis","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic modulation classification(AMC)","Contour Stellar Image(CSI)","Average percentage of zeros(APoZ)","neuron pruning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9623008","doi":"10.1109/DSA52907.2021.00029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSA52907.2021.00029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622768","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications (DSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9622894/9622768/09623008.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pruning Neural Network for Automatic Modulation Classification","abstract":"Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a promising technology for non-cooperative communication systems in both military and civilian scenarios.

In this paper, a lightweight DL based Average percentage of zeros (APoZ) is used with pruning neural. We introduce a novel method of generating modulation signals called contour stellar image (CSI). We train the data through some scaling factors in convolution neural network (CNN) especially the AlexNet. It can screen out the inconsequential neurons which can be pruned.

To evaluate the performance of this scheme, the NGSIM dataset (described below) was used. This dataset contains data acquired from the environment using a set of sensors that collect data from the neighbouring vehicles.

Due to its application in different fields such as healthcare, biometrics, and human-machine interaction, a plethora of research works proposing different neural networks have been conducted in the past with a majority of them focusing towards mobile sensor-based recognition due to significant advantages it holds over fixed sensor-based recognition. In this research, four neural network architectures - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ConvLSTM, and CNN-LSTM - were trained and tested on the WISDM Dataset independent of the subject for classifying different classes of human activities. The CNN-LSTM architecture was observed to have the highest efficiency among different models used in the research for classifying different types of hand-oriented and non-hand-oriented activities. It was also found that all the aforementioned models performed better in data from the accelerometer than the same from the gyroscope. Moreover, the difference in the efficiencies of the models in the two sensors was much more significant in watches than in the phones. Furthermore, in general, patterns in sensor data from watches were found to be more distinct from one another and thus could be captured more efficiently compared to the data from phones' sensors.","doi":"10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623228","startPage":"0559","endPage":"0566","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9623064","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9623060/9623064/09623228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Neural Networks for Time Series Classification in Human Activity Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9623228/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Neural Networks for Time Series Classification in Human Activity Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9623228/","publicationDate":"27 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Neural Networks for Time Series Classification in Human Activity Recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"15_6_1570761015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048393S","chronDate":"27-30 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9623060","isNumber":"9623064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9623060","xplore-issue":"9623064","articleId":"9623228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9623237,"authors":[{"name":"Narayana Darapaneni","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning/Northwestern University, Illinois, USA"],"firstName":"Narayana","lastName":"Darapaneni","id":"37086822760"},{"name":"Naresh Suresh Reddy","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Naresh Suresh","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37089178893"},{"name":"Anitha Urkude","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Anitha","lastName":"Urkude","id":"37089181693"},{"name":"Anwesh Reddy Paduri","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Anwesh Reddy","lastName":"Paduri","id":"37088596958"},{"name":"Arati Alok Satpute","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Arati Alok","lastName":"Satpute","id":"37089182122"},{"name":"Aakash Yogi","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Aakash","lastName":"Yogi","id":"37089183170"},{"name":"Dilip Krishna Natesan","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Dilip Krishna","lastName":"Natesan","id":"37089180434"},{"name":"Sarang Surve","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Sarang","lastName":"Surve","id":"37089179475"},{"name":"Utkarsh Srivastava","affiliation":["AIML, Great Learning, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Utkarsh","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37089182575"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0066-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0067-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2644-3163"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2644-3155"}],"articleNumber":"9623237","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Road accidents","Roads","Conferences","Object detection","Mobile communication","Cameras"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Yolov3","Artificial Intelligence","Pothole","YoloV5","UNet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9623237","doi":"10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9623064","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9623060/9623064/09623237.pdf","startPage":"0567","endPage":"0572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pothole Detection Using Advanced Neural Networks","abstract":"A pothole is one among the first reasons for road accidents and is becoming increasingly important to detect while driving on roads. Detection and warning can significantly reduce accidents and damages caused to vehicles.

Recently, the advances in artificial neural network have led to varied high-performance single-shot detection algorithms. These algorithms are especially useful in real-time applications. Hence, in this paper, we present a study of various object detection algorithms towards pothole detection with its speed and accuracy.

Multiobjective optimization is developed by applying a particle swarm algorithm, and a 3D Pareto front is provided to demonstrate all non-dominating design points. Three cost functions, viz. rated braking torque, magnet mass, and magnetic flux density of the yoke, are selected as the objectives for the optimization problem, and the optimum design point is addressed in detail. The optimized design is validated by 3D-FEA and experiments. The results indicate that a 40% reduction in the magnet volume could be brought about by the optimized PM-ECB design with practically the same braking torque. Further, a 40% cost reduction in the optimized brake could be achieved compared with the reference one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9623450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9623450/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cost Minimization of a Permanent Magnet Eddy Current Brake by Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Nonlinear Reluctance Network Modeling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Finnish National Agency for Education (CIMO)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cost Minimization of a Permanent Magnet Eddy Current Brake by Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Nonlinear Reluctance Network Modeling","sourcePdf":"access-gulec-3129927-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127816S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9623450","onlineDate":"22 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9623474,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojie Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9623474/wang-3129618-small.gif","p":["Xiaojie Wang received the PhD degree from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2019.

It enables mobile clients to both extend their computing capacities by task offloading, and charge from edge servers via energy transmission. Existing studies generally focus on the centralized design of task scheduling and energy charging in WP-MEC networks. To meet the decentralization requirement of the near-coming 6G network, we propose an online learning algorithm for computation offloading in WP-MEC networks with a distributed execution manner. Specifically, we first define the delay minimization problem by considering task deadline and energy constraints. Then, we transform it into a primal-dual optimization problem based on the Bellman equation. After that, we design a novel neural model that learns both offloading and time division decisions in each time slot to solve the formulated optimization problem. To train and execute the designed algorithm distributivity, we form multiple learning models decentralized on edge servers and they work coordinately to achieve parameter synchronization. At last, both theoretical and performance analyses show that the designed algorithm has significant advantages in comparison with other representative schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online

Considering the error propagation and noise amplification effects when applying maximum likelihood and maximum ratio combining (ML-MRC)-based detection, we further propose a deep neural network (DNN)-aided detection for OFDM-based GOQSM systems. The proposed DNN-aided detection scheme performs the GOQSM detection in a joint manner, which can efficiently eliminate the adverse effects of both error propagation and noise amplification.

For optimal operation of the wind farms and stability of the grid, wind prediction ahead of time is of key importance. An accurate forecast of wind speed is often difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the wind. In this work, we utilized different machine learning models and proposed a hybrid machine learning approach. This approach combines 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) network for accurate prediction of short term wind prediction at different heights above ground level (AGL). The 1D CNN model extracts high-level features of the input wind speed data. The extracted features are then fed as input to the BLSTM network for wind speed prediction. The wind speed time series data used in this study are measured at 18, and 98 meters AGL. The study further presents a relationship between the utilized models and prediction accuracy at different heights. The forecasting performance of the models tends to increase as the height AGL increases. A real-world case study is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-BLSTM method in Saudi Arabia. The mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as performance indices to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN-BLTSM model. The corresponding results show that the proposed method outperforms other benchmark models.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129883","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09623538.pdf","startPage":"156672","endPage":"156679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Hybrid 1D CNN and BLSTM Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9623538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Hybrid 1D CNN and BLSTM Network","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9623538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004055","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"DF191002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wind Speed Prediction Using Hybrid 1D CNN and BLSTM Network","sourcePdf":"access-lawal-3129883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093528S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9623538","onlineDate":"22 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9624221,"authors":[{"name":"Xintian Mao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xintian","lastName":"Mao"},{"name":"Jiansheng Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","Engineering Center of SHMEC for Space Information and GNSS, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiansheng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xiang Tao","affiliation":["Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Tao"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","Engineering Research Center of Nanophotonics & Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Qingli Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China","Engineering Center of SHMEC for Space Information and GNSS, Shanghai, China","Engineering Research Center of Nanophotonics & Advanced Instrument, Ministry of Education, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qingli","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xiufeng Zhou","affiliation":["Dmetrix Ltd.

This process eliminates the effects of staining intensity and color difference (batch effects) from various pathologic imaging systems. In this paper, we are focusing on stain normalization and visual quality enhancement. Although state-of-the-art methods, such as CycleGAN, perform well in image style transfer, they have been limiting by raw imaging quality. This paper propose a novel framework, single generative networks (SGNet), to train the staining model. We yield data pre-augmentation instantiated by clarity-brightness-saturation (CBS) adjustment, and introduce max pooling between the input and the intermediate features and positional normalization (PONO) to optimize network structure. The proposed approach is evaluated by using the placental pathological samples with villi, trophoblast cells and vascular area. Feature fusion results on placental sample demonstrate the proposed model outperforms existing methods, ESPCN, CycleGAN and SegCN-Net. Ablation studies also show the necessity of additional components. We test this network on low-quality images from different imaging systems. Experimental results preserve detailed structural information of tissues and show desirable performances on generalization ability of histological image, which increases the segmentation accuracy for digital pathology diagnosis. These findings have the potential for the establishment of histological staining criterion, massive pathological images with batch effects can be normalized with the aid of authoritative staining benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/CISP-BMEI53629.2021.9624221","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 14th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624201/9624206/09624221.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 14th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI53629.2021.9624221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Generative Networks for Stain Normalization and Quality Enhancement of Histological Images in Digital Pathology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image segmentation","Limiting","Image color analysis","Histopathology","Signal processing algorithms","Focusing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pathological image","stain normalization","unsupervised learning","quality enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Single Generative Networks for Stain Normalization and Quality Enhancement of Histological Images in Digital Pathology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624221/","publicationDate":"23 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61975056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007219","fundingName":"Shanghai Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"19ZR1416000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"20440713100,19511120100,18DZ2270800"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Generative Networks for Stain Normalization and Quality Enhancement of Histological Images in Digital Pathology","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"a98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064874S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624201","isNumber":"9624206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624201","xplore-issue":"9624206","articleId":"9624221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9624225,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ryan","affiliation":["University of Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ryan"},{"name":"Adhi Harmoko Saputro","affiliation":["University of Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adhi Harmoko","lastName":"Saputro"},{"name":"Ardhasena Sopaheluwakan","affiliation":["Center for Research and Development Agency for Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ardhasena","lastName":"Sopaheluwakan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-623-6264-20-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3691-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9624225","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624225","abstract":"Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS) is a significant phenomenon in aviation that has the potential to cause aircraft accident. To avoid the potential accident, information about the potential of LLWS occurrence ahead was needed so the pilot can avoid the area where LLWS can happen. Previous several studies used statistical model to predict LLWS. The dataset comes from the equipment system for detecting LLWS. Most of the statistical models used are Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the dataset is taken from Lidar Doppler. The approach that is often used is to transform wind data from Lidar Doppler into time series data and feed it to the MLP. For this study, the statistical model used is Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). TCN is a dedicated time-series model. The dataset for the TCN is come from Low-level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS). We use the model to predict LLWS occurrence 5 minutes ahead. The feature input of TCN are wind direction and speed from LLWAS that already is being transformed and arranged to timeseries data west - east component (U) and south - north component (V). The label dataset is LLWAS's warning of LLWS occurrence data. As a comparison of the proposed model, a logistic regression model and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were also used. We also use varying lengths of input data to see how they perform against the model. The results show that TCN can outperform other comparison models with perfect recall and precision values (1) when using predictor time-series data longer than 5 minutes. This result means that the proposed model works well in predicting LLWS events using LLWAS data.","doi":"10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624225","startPage":"5","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624200/9624209/09624225.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Low-level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) to Predict Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS) Phenomenon Using Temporal Convolutional Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Wind speed","Time series analysis","Transforms","Predictive models","Data models","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Level Wind Shear","Low level wind shear alert system","Temporal Convolutional Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Low-level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) to Predict Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS) Phenomenon Using Temporal Convolutional Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624225/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Low-level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS) to Predict Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS) Phenomenon Using Temporal Convolutional Network","confLoc":"Semarang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p005-ryan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114131S","chronDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624200","isNumber":"9624209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624200","xplore-issue":"9624209","articleId":"9624225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9624247,"authors":[{"name":"Novendra Setyawan","affiliation":["University of Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Novendra","lastName":"Setyawan"},{"name":"Tri Septiana Nadia Puspita Putri","affiliation":["University of Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Tri Septiana Nadia Puspita","lastName":"Putri"},{"name":"Mohamad Al Fikih","affiliation":["University of Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Al Fikih"},{"name":"Nur Kasan","affiliation":["University of Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nur","lastName":"Kasan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-623-6264-20-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3691-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9624247","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Training","Deep learning","Sociology","Streaming media","Cameras","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","Face Mask Detection","Deep Learning","CNN","YOLOv3"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624247","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624200/9624209/09624247.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","startPage":"354","endPage":"358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Study of CNN and YOLOv3 in Public Health Face Mask Detection","abstract":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is gaining special concern from entire world population.

Currently, no method has been implemented in real-time. Thus, this study utilized the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to detect objects in real-time around the autonomous electric vehicle. The objects were limited to humans, motorcycles, and cars. The results showed that the most compatible YOLO model for the system was the Tiny YOLOv4 model which was built with the darknet framework. The simulation experiment showed that detection accuracy was 80% and was able to transmit information in a form of data location of the object to the microcontroller. A success rate of 100% was obtained from 10 tests. Hence, it showed that the YOLO was able to detect objects and provided input to the steering control system. Meanwhile, the depth information method was used to measure the distance of the object to the vehicle in real-time with an accuracy of 60%. Real-time testing was conducted to test whether the autonomous electric vehicle can avoid objects in front of it by providing input from the detection results of the Tiny- YOLOv4 model object.

Some cases of arrhythmia are not considered serious, while others are very dangerous, life-threatening, and cause death in a short period of time. In the clinical routine, cardiac arrhythmia detection is performed by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The ECG is a significant diagnosis tool that is used to record the electrical activity of the heart, and its signals can reveal abnormal heart activity. However, because of their small amplitude and duration, visual interpretation of ECG signals is difficult. Many deep and machine learning approaches have been proposed for automatically arrhythmia classification. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been achieved promising performances in this field that proved the efficiency of deep convolutional neural networks in automated detection and, therefore, cardiovascular disease protection as well as help cardiologists in medical practice by saving.","doi":"10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624304","startPage":"208","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624200/9624209/09624304.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Arrhythmia Classification: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Arrhythmia Classification: A Review","conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624304/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convolutional Neural Network for Arrhythmia Classification: A Review","confLoc":"Semarang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p208-kamil.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093061S","chronDate":"20-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624200","isNumber":"9624209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624200","xplore-issue":"9624209","articleId":"9624304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9624311,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Fauzan Ridho","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Universitas Multi Data Palembang, Palembang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Fauzan","lastName":"Ridho","id":"37089182583"},{"name":"Irwan","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Universitas Multi Data Palembang, Palembang, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Irwan","id":"37089181355"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-623-6264-20-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3691-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9624311","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Robot vision systems","Transfer learning","Object detection","Manipulators","Cameras","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["harvesting robot","Deep Neural Network","object detection","computer vision","ROS"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624311","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624200/9624209/09624311.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strawberry Fruit Quality Assessment for Harvesting Robot using SSD Convolutional Neural Network","abstract":"Strawberry has a tremendous economic value as well as being visually appealing. Therefore, strawberry farmers need to ensure that they only harvest good quality strawberries. However, assessing the quality of strawberries is not an easy problem, especially for local plantations which do not have enough human resources. As robotics becomes accessible and widely used for agriculture work such as harvesting fruit, the real-time embedded system computation power becomes much more powerful nowadays. This paper discusses the harvesting robot's ability to distinguish the quality of strawberries in realtime detection using computer vision technology in the form of object detection by utilizing a deep neural network in a single board computer (SBC). The robot software is built on Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The proposed method is tested on a robot equipped with a monocular camera.

Six extra deep layers are added to the recurrent neural network (RNN) to improve the performance of the HAR system at night. These layers extract the most complex features from thermal infrared imaging for classification. The sequence classification technique is applied to separately merged data. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed (up to 98.0%) on the MHAD dataset than the SVM and LSTM methods.

In HAR, inertial sensors are widely used due to their advantages of low-cost, small size, and portability. In view of device complexity and power consumption, it is hopeful to use a single inertial sensor to realize the recognition of routine activities, such as walking, walking upstairs, or downstairs. Obviously, this is more difficult than using multiple sensors. In this study, we proposed a method combined convolutional neural network (CNN) with deep feedforward sequential memory networks (DFSMN), which is capable of modeling longterm dependency in temporal series, for HAR based on the dataset collected by a single inertial sensor. CNN was responsible for extracting data features, and then DFSMN performed the classification of activities based on these features. Two inertial sensors were placed on waist and thigh of human body, thus two independent datasets were collected separately. The proposed method was applied to these two datasets, and satisfied results were obtained.

The existing SSR methods introduce prior information to the task of sparse aperture ISAR imaging via regularization. However, the obtained images are too sparse to provide rich structural information of the target due to the simple regular term constraint. In this paper, a novel prior framework for sparse aperture ISAR imaging is proposed, which utilizes complex-valued U-Net (CV-U-Net) networks as the denoiser prior module to learn prior information. The prior model based on the CV-U-Net network is combined with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which we call U-ADMM. It can bridge the weakness between learning-based methods and model-based methods. Moreover, the U-ADMM is unrolled into a deep neural network, dubbed as U-ADMMNet, which solves the limitation of the same denoiser in each iteration of the past methods. Simulation and measured experimental results show that the proposed U-ADMMNet imaging method can significantly improve the image quality from limited observations while keeping more powerful robustness and adaptability than other state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9624397/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","publicationDate":"23 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"U-ADMMNet: A Mdel-Based Deep Learning Method for Sparse Aperture ISAR Imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"U-ADMMNet: A Mdel-Based Deep Learning Method for Sparse Aperture ISAR Imaging","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093786S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624201","isNumber":"9624206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624201","xplore-issue":"9624206","articleId":"9624397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9624414,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangwei Kong","affiliation":["Chinese Flight Test Establishment, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiangwei","lastName":"Kong"},{"name":"Linxuan Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Flight Test Establishment, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Linxuan","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Hong Li","affiliation":["Chinese Flight Test Establishment, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Zhenhua Wu","affiliation":["Chinese Flight Test Establishment, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Yu Wu","affiliation":["Chinese Flight Test Establishment, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0004-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0003-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0005-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9624414","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global navigation satellite system","Interpolation","Recurrent neural networks","Satellites","Atmospheric modeling","Time series analysis","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global Navigation Satellite System","missing data","LSTM","styling","Interpolation completion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CISP-BMEI53629.2021.9624414","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624201/9624206/09624414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 14th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 14th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI53629.2021.9624414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Completion of Global Navigation Satellite System Missing Data Based on Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network","abstract":"In fight test, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data missing inevitably in GNSS data recording attribute to such factors as satellite anomalies, follow-up reject of gross errors and so on.

Genetic Algorithm is used for gain tuning of the lateral velocity of truck and steering control parameter which are input controls of the system. Due to minimizing the tracking error of the controller design, Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) was employed as the fitness function of the algorithm with jackknife prevention constraint. A penalty method for transforming the constrained problem into an equivalent unconstrained problem has been proposed in this paper. The convergence behavior of the ordinary penalty function depends on the selection of penalty parameters. The optimization of the penalty function is achieved after several rounds of optimization where different values in each round and stopping after max iteration criteria are reached. The result showed that the methods can make the system remain in a constrained condition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624473/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624473/","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anti-Jackknife Autonomous Truck Trailer for Path Following Control Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-Jackknife Autonomous Truck Trailer for Path Following Control Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"36-2021194472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067821S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624471","isNumber":"9624472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624471","xplore-issue":"9624472","articleId":"9624473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9624479,"authors":[{"name":"Hendra Ganda Prawira","affiliation":["Univ.

The choice of feature extraction method depends on the characteristics of the variables being reviewed. Often frequency extraction is advantageous. Besides removing the noise recorded in the signal, the emotion variable has characteristics in the frequency band. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the methods used as a frequency filter. However, for EEG signals, it is necessary the short time to be approached as a stationary signal, and FFT gives fast computing. This research proposed FFT as a method filter to classify emotion before using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). RNN is a method that can capture the connection between signals so that it is suitable for EEG signals. FFT filtered one-second signal in frequency 4-45 Hz to get Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Gamma waves. Three classes of emotions, Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The experiment shows that the FFT filter increased the accuracy from 68.16% without FFT to 80.60%. FFT reduced the classification time from 0.88 seconds up to 0.05 seconds. There are three weight correction techniques used Adaptive Moment Estimation with Maximum (AdaMax), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), which gave near to the same accuracy. At the same time, a small learning rate (0.0001) made much better accuracy. We examined one-second segment was better compared to a five-second at processing emotional EEG signals. These results indicate that the FFT has a limited processing duration to close to a stationary signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9624479","startPage":"94","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9624479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624472","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624471/9624472/09624479.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion Classification Using Fast Fourier Transform and Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624479/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Emotion Classification Using Fast Fourier Transform and Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624479/","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion Classification Using Fast Fourier Transform and Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"20-2021194351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07221S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624471","isNumber":"9624472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624471","xplore-issue":"9624472","articleId":"9624479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9624499,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Sun","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Micro-system Laboratory, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0002-5747-4202"},{"name":"Jianpo Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Micro-system Laboratory, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianpo","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yuanqing Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Micro-system Laboratory, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Baoqing Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Micro-system Laboratory, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Baoqing","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4029-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4030-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-7896"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2475-790X"}],"articleNumber":"9624499","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Solid modeling","Target recognition","Neural networks","Radar","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft-Boundary Deep SVDD","HRRP Target Recognition","LSTM Neural Network","Data Fusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624499","abstract":"Radar high-resolution range profile (HRRP) target recognition is an active part of radar target recognition (ATR).

The range and Doppler migration would cause the target's energy distributed among multiple range or Doppler bins. Moreover, the heavy computational burden of long-time integration is a challenging problem that needs to be solved. A novel non-parametric searching sparse long-time coherent integration (LTCI) method is proposed for highly maneuverable target detection using MIMO radar. Time-reversed and non-uniform resampling (TRNU) are designed to remove the migrations and adaptive sparse Fourier transform is employed to reduce the computational burden. The maneuvering target would appear as peaks in the TRNU-sparse LTCI (SLTCI) domain with less clutter. Experiments using S-band real radar data indicate that the proposed method can achieve a good balance between computational cost and integration performance compared with classical methods, e.g., Radon-Fourier transform (RFT) and Radon-fractional FT (RFRFT).","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624603","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624202","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624464/9624202/09624603.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","MIMO radar","Radar clutter","Radar detection","Radar","Object detection","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar maneuvering target detection","Long-time coherent integration","Non-parametric searching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Non-Parametric Searching Sparse Long-Time Coherent Integration Method for Highly Maneuverable Target of MIMO Radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624603/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9624603/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","publicationDate":"14 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871391,U1933135,61931021,61971336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Parametric Searching Sparse Long-Time Coherent Integration Method for Highly Maneuverable Target of MIMO Radar","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"Paper_070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059217S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624464","isNumber":"9624202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624464","xplore-issue":"9624202","articleId":"9624603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9624638,"authors":[{"name":"Dezhi Tian","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic and Information Technology in Satellite Navigation (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dezhi","lastName":"Tian","id":"37089183535"},{"name":"Wei Ren","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic and Information Technology in Satellite Navigation (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37089184763"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic and Information Technology in Satellite Navigation (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089186395"},{"name":"Zhennan Liang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Electronic and Information Technology in Satellite Navigation (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhennan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37088471936"},{"name":"Quanhua Liu","affiliation":["Chongqing Innovation Center, Beijing Institute of Technology, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Quanhua","lastName":"Liu","id":"38238560500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4029-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4030-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-7896"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2475-790X"}],"articleNumber":"9624638","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9624638","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Parameter estimation","Simulation","Information filters","Feature extraction","Signal reconstruction","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chopping and interleaving (C&I) jamming","jamming suppression","mismatched filter","parameter estimation","time-frequency (TF)"]}],"abstract":"Chopping and Interleaving (C&I) jamming based on digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) can achieve effects of both deception and suppression, posing a serious threat to modern radar systems. Hence a novel adaptive scheme for C&I jamming suppression based on the mismatched filter is proposed in this paper. First, coherent accumulation and image binarization are used to enhance the time-frequency (TF) characteristics of the signal. Then the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is preformed to extract the TF features of C&I jamming for jamming parameter estimation, and the time-domain signal without noise is reconstructed. Finally, the mismatched filter is optimized based on the reconstructed signal to achieve jamming suppression. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624638","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624464/9624202/09624638.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive scheme for chopping and interleaving jamming suppression based on the mismatched filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive scheme for chopping and interleaving jamming suppression based on the mismatched filter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9624638/","publicationDate":"14 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624638/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771050"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive scheme for chopping and interleaving jamming suppression based on the mismatched filter","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"Paper_014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05684S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624464","isNumber":"9624202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624464","xplore-issue":"9624202","articleId":"9624638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9624756,"authors":[{"name":"Erick A.

There exist various approaches to this issue, e.g., tone mapping operators (TMOs) and multi-exposure fusion algorithms (MEFs). Many existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods have been proposed to compare images of quality degradation generated by TMOs/MEFs. Although promising performances have been achieved, they seldom consider local specific artifacts difference (i.e., abnormal exposure and color cast) related with the TMOs/MEFs. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a Blind Quality Evaluator of Tone-Mapped HDR and Multi-Exposure Fused Images (BQE-TM/MEFI). First, two purpose-designed segment models are utilized to distinguish well-exposedness dense patches (WEDPes) and non-WEDPes, color cast patches (CCPes) and non-CCPes respectively. Second, multiple quality-perception features are extracted to measure local artifacts: 1) structure and sharpness features from WEDPes, 2) saturation features from non-CCPes, and 3) edge structure features. Then, three new low-complexity regional features (over-exposure ratio, entropy and color confidence index) are calculated based on over-exposure segmentation model. Finally, all extracted features are aggregated into a machine-learning regression model to pool a quality score. The simplicity and good performance of the proposed method makes it suitable for electronic displays and other consumer electronics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9624963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9624963/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Quality Evaluator of Tone-Mapped HDR and Multi-Exposure Fused Images for Electronic Display","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671282, 61931022 and 62176084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Quality Evaluator of Tone-Mapped HDR and Multi-Exposure Fused Images for Electronic Display","sourcePdf":"tce-shen-3130176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065133S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9624963","onlineDate":"23 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9625065,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mohebbi","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mohebbi","id":"37904083300"},{"name":"Hamed Abdzadeh-Ziabari","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Abdzadeh-Ziabari","id":"38262161300"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Zhu","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37275886700"},{"name":"M.

In the first step, the dominant delay taps of the channel are selected by using an energy detector. In the second step, utilizing the basis expansion model (BEM) for effectively representing doubly selective channels, a BEM-based block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is proposed for estimating the gains of the selected delay taps. The proposed method benefits from exploiting the entire available training sequence to estimate all channel parameters, is capable of capturing channel variations across the whole training frames and does not require any feedback. Computer simulations and complexity evaluations show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the mean squared error performance compared with the existing techniques without increasing the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625065","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625065.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Channel Estimation Method for Millimeter Wave Systems Under High Mobility","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A New Channel Estimation Method for Millimeter Wave Systems Under High Mobility","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9625065/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625065/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Channel Estimation Method for Millimeter Wave Systems Under High Mobility","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07229S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9625091,"authors":[{"name":"Chenhao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chenhao","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Wenjie Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Xi Hong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Hong"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1368-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"9625091","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625091","abstract":"Sparse linear array has been widely used for its good performance of large aperture and low cost.

However the GNSS signals are not always available in environments such as denied or indoor areas. To address this issue, in this paper, a joint neighbor discovery and positioning method for UAV network is proposed to deal with the scenarios with poor GNSS signals. Specifically, during the neighbor discovery process, the Two-Way Ranging (TWR) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) algorithm is utilized. In addition, an approximate optimal multi-hop positioning method is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed. Numerically, the results demonstrate the positioning accuracy and the convergence of the neighbor discovery process.

However, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) has been one of the major drawbacks of OTFS systems, which impairs the efficiency of the power amplifier. To resolve the problem, we propose a PAPR reduction method based on the autoencoder (AE) architecture through deep learning (DL) techniques, where the encoder is trained to reduce the PAPR and the decoder is trained to reconstruct the original signal. By carefully designing the loss function, the bit error rate (BER) and the PAPR are simultaneously minimized, and a hyper-parameter is introduced to achieve a good compromise between BER and PAPR in the proposed scheme. Simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed scheme as compared to the other conventional schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625251","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625251.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoencoder Based PAPR Reduction for OTFS Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Autoencoder Based PAPR Reduction for OTFS Modulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625251/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001417,91938202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LQ20F010010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoencoder Based PAPR Reduction for OTFS Modulation","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077764S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9625274,"authors":[{"name":"Syed M.

multiple access (SCMA) has excellent application prospects due to its high spectral efficiency and accsess capacity. However, due to the nonorthogonal characteristic of SCMA in code domain, the codebook needs to be manually designed for all communication scenarios, and the receiver has high computational complexity. To address this issue, deep neural network-aided SCMA (DNN-SCMA) is proposed, but it is difficult to capture channel state information (CSI) in the dynamic and time-varying communication scenarios, which hinders the overall learning and optimization fot end-to-end communications. This paper proposes a stochastic channel model with conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for DNN-aided SCMA in a data-driven way. Particularly, a model-free learning method is adopted to accurately learn different types of random channel models, which realizes effective acquisition of dynamic channel information. Finally, the end-to-end training is achieved through the use of back propagation (BP), and then by an iterative training of the composed networks, the end-to-end loss can be optimized in a supervised manner. Results show the feasibility of CGAN-based channel modeling in end-to-end DNN-SCMA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625321/","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Channel Modeling for Deep Neural Network-aided Sparse Code Multiple Access Communications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771163"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Channel Modeling for Deep Neural Network-aided Sparse Code Multiple Access Communications","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053237S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9625322,"authors":[{"name":"Huilin Jiang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, P.

This paper considers a full duplex (FD) cooperative NOMA (FD-C-NOMA) system, including one base station (BS), one near user and one far user, where the near user serves as the FD decode-and-forward relay to transmit the signals of the far user. As a common practical implementation problem, the impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) is taken into account in system performance analysis. Under the given framework, we derive the closed-form outage probability and the approximate closed-form average rate for the near user and the far user. As analytically expected, simulation results verify that the system performance of the FD-C-NOMA is much better than those of non-cooperative NOMA and half duplex cooperative NOMA (HD-C-NOMA) systems. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation proves the accuracy of our calculation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Vehicular and wireless technologies","Interference cancellation","Closed-form solutions","System performance","Simulation","Probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access","successive interference cancellation","outage probability","average rate"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625322","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625322.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Full Duplex Cooperative NOMA System with Imperfect SIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Full Duplex Cooperative NOMA System with Imperfect SIC","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625322/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"The National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Full Duplex Cooperative NOMA System with Imperfect SIC","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088296S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9625359,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Shizeng Guo","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shizeng","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Yulong Gao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Gao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1368-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"9625359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicular and wireless technologies","Recurrent neural networks","Correlation","Simulation","Conferences","Dynamic spectrum access","Reinforcement learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic spectrum access","POMDP","deep reinforcement learning","bidirectional recurrent neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625359","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) with partial observations under the cognitive radio framework. It is the heart of the matter for improving spectrum utilization efficiency. In general, DSA can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). While, extensive computational complexity is prohibitive for existing traditional methods. And the lack of environmental information makes some data-driven methods perform poorly. Bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is an extended form of unidirectional LSTM. Processing input sequence from both directions gives BRNN strong ability to perceive and predict sequential information. By introducing BRNN to deep reinforcement learning (DRL), Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Q-Network (DBRQN) is formed to obtain sequential correlation of input and achieve the optimal strategy. Extensive experiments indicate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method in the case of simulated data and real data.","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625359","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625359.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning With Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic Spectrum Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning With Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic Spectrum Access","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9625359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625359/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning With Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081269S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9625366,"authors":[{"name":"Hung D.

Simulation results show that the BER performance of OFDM-ELIM is better than conventional OFDM-IM, especially in low SNR region.","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625482","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625482.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM with Enhanced Layered Index Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"OFDM with Enhanced Layered Index Modulation","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9625482/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625482/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62001138"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012429","fundingName":"Central Universities","grantNumber":"3072021CF0809"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005046","fundingName":"Heilongjiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LH2021F009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004027","fundingName":"Hei Long Jiang Postdoctoral Foundation","grantNumber":"LBH-Z20049"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM with Enhanced Layered Index Modulation","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077142S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9625497,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengran He","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengran","lastName":"He","id":"37089186210"},{"name":"Hao Huang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086458359"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085359037"},{"name":"Guan Gui","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37590883700"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"},{"name":"Bamidele Adebisi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Bamidele","lastName":"Adebisi","id":"37540810700"},{"name":"Haris Gacanin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Gacanin","id":"37280076500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1368-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"9625497","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625497","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Vehicular and wireless technologies","Array signal processing","Simulation","Design methodology","Millimeter wave technology","MISO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter-wave","intelligent reconfigurable surface","beamforming","unsupervised learning"]}],"abstract":"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) is considered one of the promising techniques in next-generation wireless communication.

In this paper, we combine an unsupervised learning-based fast beamforming method with IRS-aided MISO systems, to significantly reduce the computational complexity of this system. Specifically, a new beamforming design method is proposed by adopting the feature fusion means in unsupervised learning. By designing a specific loss function, the beamforming can be obtained to make the spectrum more efficient, and the complexity is lower than that of the existing algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed beamforming method can effectively reduce the computational complexity while obtaining relatively good performance results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625497","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625497.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Beamforming Design Method for IRS-Aided mmWave MISO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fast Beamforming Design Method for IRS-Aided mmWave MISO Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625497/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Beamforming Design Method for IRS-Aided mmWave MISO Systems","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067887S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9625500,"authors":[{"name":"Lanxin He","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lanxin","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1368-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"9625500","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Vehicular and wireless technologies","Tools","MIMO","Complexity theory","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["large-scale MIMO detection","projected gradient descent","recurrent neural network","sparse representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625500","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625500.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Sparse MIMO Detection Network Based on Modified Projected Gradient Descent Method","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for signal detection in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

First of all, in order to reduce complexity, RS-Net unfolds the projected gradient descent (PGD) method in a modified way, which consists of a projection and a gradient descent (GD) part. Meanwhile, an RNN with the parameter-sharing structure is adopted to its projection, which significantly eases the training burden. Then, to improve the detection performance, we regularize RS-Net by introducing sparse representation. Besides, the step size of iterations in GD part is also investigated for better convergence efficiency.

In this paper, we apply DL algorithms to enhance signal detection and performance of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with index modulation (IM). The proposed detector termed DLIM is used as fully connected layers of a deep neural network (DNN) and adopted to achieve minimum bit error rates in IM-MIMO-OFDM over Rayleigh wireless channels. To show the enhancement of the proposed algorithm, the DL model is trained initially offline using data generated from simulation based on common statistical wireless channel models. DLIM is then adopted to recover the online transmitted data. Simulation results confirm that the proposed DLIM can detect the transmitted symbols with a performance comparable to near-optimal BER in a shorter runtime than required by the existing classical detectors.","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625569","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625569.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Detector for IM-MIMO-OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Learning-Based Detector for IM-MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625569/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Learning-Based Detector for IM-MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052038S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9625585,"authors":[{"name":"Yuting Wang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088855058"},{"name":"Jinlong Sun","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China","The Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086921373"},{"name":"Jie Wang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086930646"},{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, NJUPT, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089184541"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"},{"name":"Bamidele Adebisi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Bamidele","lastName":"Adebisi","id":"37540810700"},{"name":"Haris Gacanin","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Gacanin","id":"37280076500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1368-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1369-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-2465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1090-3038"}],"articleNumber":"9625585","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Vehicular and wireless technologies","Simulation","Transfer learning","Neural networks","Massive MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink CSI feedback","deep learning","transfer learning","massive MIMO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625585","abstract":"Accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) is one of the essential requirements for harnessing the potential advantages of frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The current state-of-art in this vibrant research area include the use of deep learning to compress and feedback downlink CSI at the user equipments (UEs). These approaches focus mainly on achieving CSI feedback with high reconstruction performance and low complexity, but at the expense of inflexible compression rate (CR). High training overheads and limited storage capacity requirements are some of the challenges associated with the design of dynamic CR, which instantaneously adapt to propagation environment. This paper applies transfer learning (TL) to develop a multi-rate CSI compression and recovery neural network (TL-MRNet) with reduced training overheads. Simulation results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed TL-MRNet over traditional methods in terms of normalized mean square error and cosine similarity.","doi":"10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625585","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624467/9625043/09625585.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Rate Compression for Downlink CSI Based on Transfer Learning in FDD Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Rate Compression for Downlink CSI Based on Transfer Learning in FDD Massive MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9625585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625585/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012327","fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications","grantNumber":"KFKT-2020106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Rate Compression for Downlink CSI Based on Transfer Learning in FDD Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Norman, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"PID2021003249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06569S","chronDate":"27-30 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624467","isNumber":"9625043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624467","xplore-issue":"9625043","articleId":"9625585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9625587,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

Temporal represents the signal from each channel, while spatial represents the signal from multi-channel. Therefore, the processing needs to be handled at once in identifying EEG signals. Previous research has conducted multi-channels handling various methods, but it needs to pay attention to signal sequences, considering that EEG signal is sequential data. This research proposed Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) to identifying post-stroke EEG signals. EEG signals for each channel are passed Wavelet to filter in 1-13 Hz. This frequency band contains low waves such as Delta, Theta, and Alpha often observed in post-stroke patients. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have extracted multi-channel signals before being identified using Recurrent Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdaDelta were used for making result corrections in the identified stage.

BESS generally consists of battery modules connecting in series or parallel configurations to achieve operational voltage and capacity. In such a complex system, a battery management system (BMS) is necessary to guarantee safety, reliability, and efficiency while in operation. One critical function of BMS is the state of charge (SoC) estimation of the battery system. It is necessary to have a battery monitoring system based on the internet of things (IoT) enabled devices that can transmit SoC data in real-time. This paper proposed SOC estimation using an artificial neural network (ANN) to reduce the estimation error due to physical parameters and reduce computation cost using an IoT-enabled embedded system. The experimental setup is set using 15 cells of high capacity of lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries with nominal voltage 3.2VDC and 100Ah. The battery cells are connected in series to achieve a BESS nominal voltage of 48VDC. The result of SoC estimation shows the ANN model provides better accuracy than the support vector machine method. Both qualitative perspective (curve plot) and quantitative perspective (model metrics) justify the accuracy of the ANN model. The ANN model also successfully deploys on MCU as an IoT-enabled embedded system.","doi":"10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9625697","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9625697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624472","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624471/9624472/09625697.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State of Charge (SoC) Estimation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based on IoT- Enabled Embedded System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625697/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"State of Charge (SoC) Estimation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based on IoT- Enabled Embedded System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9625697/","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014538","fundingName":"Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State of Charge (SoC) Estimation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based on IoT- Enabled Embedded System","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"17-2021194341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060194S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624471","isNumber":"9624472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624471","xplore-issue":"9624472","articleId":"9625697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9625702,"authors":[{"name":"Sinta Sundari","affiliation":["Univ.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) can capture emotional information objectively. Nevertheless, it needs appropriate processing. The multichannel of EEG gives much information that yields redundancies. Thus, it can view the information from the multichannel spatially and the sequence between signals as temporal in processing. Several methods are often used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The combination of CNN and RNN utilizes a large amount of information from multi-channel and reserves the characteristics of RNN for processing sequence data such as EEG signals. So that it can maintain the signal sequence information of each channel, this paper proposed the CNN-RNN to identify three positive, negative, and neutral classes of emotions. The EEG signal was filtered at a frequency of 4-45 Hz, according to the signal characteristics of the three emotion classes. It used Wavelet to get Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma waves. The results showed that the use of CNN as multi-channel handling could increase the accuracy, from 91.98%, compared to 79.52% with only RNN. On the other side, CNN-RNN can provide a shorter computation time. However, the choice of emotional duration is significant. Experiments suggest that a second represents more emotional change than five seconds.","doi":"10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9625702","pdfPath":"/iel7/9624471/9624472/09625702.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICA52848.2021.9625702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9624472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Emotion Based on Electroencephalogram Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Emotion Based on Electroencephalogram Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625702/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Emotion Based on Electroencephalogram Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"41-2021194482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130302S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9624471","isNumber":"9624472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9624471","xplore-issue":"9624472","articleId":"9625702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9625784,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Zhang","affiliation":["National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-0832-474X","id":"37088537095"},{"name":"Zhenxing Dong","affiliation":["National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Dong","id":"37089243773"},{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-3933-5583","id":"37086357499"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9625784","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EddySuperblock: Improving NAND Flash Efficiency and Lifetime by Endurance-Driven Dynamic Superblock Management","abstract":"Solid-state drives (SSDs) are widely used in current storage systems. SSD manufacturers usually aggregate physical blocks across planes into one superblock to improve SSD performance. However, due to the wear endurance variations among blocks and pages, the standard superblock scheme leads to lifetime and space waste of SSDs. Superblock granularity also causes higher and more uncertain garbage collection overhead. To address these problems, this work proposes endurance-driven dynamic superblock management called \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">EddySuperblock</i>\n to provide a longer lifetime and higher space utilization with a faster and deterministic response time, which designs a dynamic superblock organization strategy that links free strong blocks into one superblock according to the real-time wear index of each block and introduces page-level wear management to further unlock the lifetime potential of pages. To reduce the high garbage collection overhead caused by superblocks, a nonblocking parallel garbage collection policy is proposed, which can reclaim space and serve requests simultaneously with low overhead. We conduct a set of experiments on a real hardware experiment platform. Both the proposed \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">EddySuperblock</i>\n and representative superblock schemes have been implemented on the experiment platform. The experimental results show that our scheme greatly reduces the average system response time by 47.6% and prolongs the lifetime by 75.6% compared with the state-of-the-art superblock scheme, and the final-state flash utilization reaches 95.4%.

The images were transmitted via WiFi to a back-end server system for image analysis and classification. Unlike common image classification approaches which are based on averaging image intensity from a region-of-interest (ROI), a novel approach was developed which considered the signal along the sample\u2019s flow direction as a time series and, consequently, no need for ROI detection. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were deployed for multilevel classification. The features based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and histogram bin counts (HBC) were explored for classification. \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Results:</b>\n For the classification of hsCRP, the LSTM outperformed the traditional machine learning classifiers with or without DTW and HBC features performed the best (with mean accuracy of 94%) compared to other features.

Cooperative behaviors are generally impractical due to stakeholders\u2019 self-interest and regulatory requirements. Considering this obstacle, this paper proposes a data-driven bilevel model, in a competitive context, to estimate the operational information of the neighboring rival\u2019s reservoir, including its historical operating states and operational functions. The proposed bilevel model is an inverse problem of the conventional hydropower scheduling model. The upper-level model is designed to find the most appropriate operational parameters of the estimated reservoir that fit its historical generation volumes. The lower-level model simulates the profit-maxing operation of the estimated reservoir. Since the lower simulating model is nonconvex, an Enhanced Parallel Genetic Algorithm (EPGA) is proposed. It avoids infeasible situations through several strategies and uses multiple CPU threads simultaneously in solving. A case study in China\u2019s market demonstrates that the proposed model and solving method can efficiently obtain accurate state series and (near-)optimal operational parameters. More experiments are also taken to validate the parallel design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reservoirs","Hydroelectric power generation","Data models","Stakeholders","Solid modeling","Predictive models","Inverse problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilevel problem","data-driven model","hydropower operation","inverse optimization","parallel genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09625992.pdf","startPage":"159640","endPage":"159651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Bilevel Model for Estimating Operational Information of a Neighboring Rival\u2019s Reservoir in a Competitive Context","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9625992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Bilevel Model for Estimating Operational Information of a Neighboring Rival\u2019s Reservoir in a Competitive Context","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9625992/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9625992/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"52039002, 51709035 and 51879030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Data-Driven Bilevel Model for Estimating Operational Information of a Neighboring Rival\u2019s Reservoir in a Competitive Context","sourcePdf":"access-cheng-3130410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162412S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9625992","onlineDate":"23 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9626012,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar Mansoor Kamoona","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Faculty of Engineering, University of Kufa, Najaf, Iraq"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9626012/kamoo-3130261-small.gif","p":["Ammar Mansoor Kamoona (Student Member, IEEE) received the master\u2019s degree (Hons.) in electronic and electrical engineering from the Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia, in 2016.

Recently, optical defect detection has been investigated as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">anomaly detection</i>\n using different deep learning methods. Most current works employ feature extraction methods that describe the entire image using a single feature vector, called the global feature. However, the use of the global feature is affected by changes in several factors, such as lighting and viewpoint changes. An alternative is to use \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">point pattern</i>\n features known as local features or \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">keypoints</i>\n which are robust to changes in conditions mentioned earlier. The use of robust point pattern features, such as SIFT, for defect detection and modelling these features within the developed random set-based method is not yet explored. This paper proposes the use of point pattern features within a random finite set framework for defect detection. Also, we evaluate different point pattern feature detectors and descriptors, handcrafted point pattern features (e.g., SIFT), and pre-trained deep features, for defect detection applications. Experiments on a large-scale defect detection dataset (MVTec-AD) are carried out. The results are compared with state-of-the-art global feature-based anomaly detection methods. Results show that using point pattern features as data points within the random finite set-based anomaly detection, achieves the most consistent defect detection accuracy on the MVTec-AD dataset. In addition, this evaluation shows that transfer learning of deep local features has promising results for defect detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130261","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09626012.pdf","startPage":"158672","endPage":"158681","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point Pattern Feature-Based Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing Defects, in the Random Finite Set Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Point Pattern Feature-Based Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing Defects, in the Random Finite Set Framework","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) through the Project Linkage","grantNumber":"LP160101081"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Point Pattern Feature-Based Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing Defects, in the Random Finite Set Framework","sourcePdf":"access-kamoona-3130261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127992S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9626012","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9626034,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Moritz Marutschke","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Osaka Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Daniel Moritz","lastName":"Marutschke","id":"37591078200"},{"name":"Jeremy White","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Osaka Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"White","id":"37085750637"},{"name":"Uwe Serd\u00fclt","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan","University of Zurich, Aarau, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Serd\u00fclt","id":"37085478938"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4425-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4426-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1883-3977"}],"articleNumber":"9626034","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Conferences","Education","Neural networks","Project management","Tools","Natural language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software engineering education","WordPress","Kanban","Word2Vec","Natural Language Processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626034","doi":"10.1109/IWCIA52852.2021.9626034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCIA52852.2021.9626034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626018","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9625862/9626018/09626034.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WordPress and Kanban Use in Software Engineering Education Evaluated by Natural Language Processing and Neural Network","abstract":"One of the challenges in software engineering education is to present students a real-world scenario and train them in project management techniques in combination with technological literacy and intercultural communication to collaborate effectively.

It is challenging to achieve high data rate (up to Mbps), low bit-error-rate (BER< 0.1%) data telemetry, as well as simultaneous high energy-efficiency power transmission, with small-volume flexible devices. In this paper, an energy-autonomous power-and-data telemetry circuit with digital-assisted-phase lock loop (PLL)-based binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) demodulator for implantable flexible electronics applications has been proposed. Only a single pair of coils has been employed to transmit both power and data based on a BPSK modulated Class-E amplifier. The energy recovery circuit enables a battery-less energy-autonomous implantable device. The proposed digital-assisted control circuitry resets the PLL to maintain the lock state and demodulate the BPSK data. As a result, the maximum data rate is no longer limited by the PLL\u2019s bandwidth, which can be improved significantly. The chip has been implemented with standard 180nm CMOS process, occupying an area of 0.96 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The current testing regime based on Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV-2 has been unable to keep up with testing demands, and also suffers from a relatively low positive detection rate in the early stages of the resultant COVID-19 disease. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated large-scale testing of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) points to a promising approach to address this challenge. WMSs enable continuous and user-transparent monitoring of physiological signals. However, disease detection based on WMSs/DNNs and their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging problems. To address these problems, we propose a framework called CovidDeep that combines efficient DNNs with commercially available WMSs for pervasive testing of the virus and the resultant disease. CovidDeep does not depend on manual feature extraction. It directly operates on WMS data and some easy-to-answer questions in a questionnaire whose answers can be obtained through a smartphone application. We collected data from 87 individuals, spanning three cohorts including healthy, asymptomatic (to detect the virus), and symptomatic (to detect the disease) patients. We trained DNNs on various subsets of the features automatically extracted from six WMS and questionnaire categories to perform ablation studies to determine which subsets are most efficacious in terms of test accuracy for a three-way classification. The highest test accuracy obtained was 98.1%. The models were also shown to perform well on other performance measures, such as false positive rate, false negative rate, and F1 score. We augmented the real training dataset with a synthetic training dataset drawn from the same probability distribution to impose a prior on DNN weights and leveraged a grow-and-prune synthesis paradigm to learn both DNN architecture and weights. This boosted the accuracy of the various DNNs further and simultaneously reduced their size and floating-point operations. This makes the CovidDeep DNNs both accurate and efficient, in terms of memory requirements and computations. The resultant DNNs are embedded in a smartphone application, which has the added benefit of preserving patient privacy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626158/","displayDocTitle":"CovidDeep: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Test Based on Wearable Medical Sensors and Efficient Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1907381"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"CovidDeep: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Test Based on Wearable Medical Sensors and Efficient Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tce-hassantabar-3130228-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098096S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9626158","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9626160,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassem Jaberipur","affiliation":["Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ghassem","lastName":"Jaberipur","orcid":"0000-0001-8458-7627","id":"37295844900"},{"name":"Farzad Ghazanfari","affiliation":["Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Ghazanfari","id":"37089244511"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9626160","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Radix-10 Redundant Digit Set [\u22126, 9] on Basic Decimal Arithmetic Operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Arithmetic","Delays","Logic gates","Costs","Very large scale integration","Encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carry-free addition (CFA)","decimal computer arithmetic","redundant number system (RDNS)","very large-scale integration (VLSI) design"]}],"abstract":"Redundant-digit decimal computer arithmetic, with the principal property of carry-free addition, has been the subject of several studies, as the relevant literature contains a wide variety of decimal digit sets and their binary representations.

However, digit sets with the minimal 4-bit representations show better figures of merit. In this work, we present a new decimal digit set [\u22126, 9], called diminished-6 overloaded decimal digit set (DODDS). Its special 4-bit representation contains two posibits (weighted \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{3}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{0}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) and two negabits (weighted \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n). Design and implementation of the corresponding carry-free decimal adders and subtractors are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, to cover the requirements of all possible DODDS applications in decimal multipliers, dividers, and square rooters, we provide adder/subtractor designs for a variety of input combinations of DODDS and binary coded decimal (BCD) operands, all with DODDS output (e.g., DODDS + BCD = DODDS, which is useful in BCD partial product reduction). Analytical and synthesis-based evaluations and comparisons with similar previous works show the notable merits of DODDS over the other redundant decimal digit sets.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9686552/09626160.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3120065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Radix-10 Redundant Digit Set [\u22126, 9] on Basic Decimal Arithmetic Operations","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9626160/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626160/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006115","fundingName":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)","grantNumber":"CS1400-2-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Radix-10 Redundant Digit Set [\u22126, 9] on Basic Decimal Arithmetic Operations","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jaberipur-3120065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119242S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9686552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9686552","articleId":"9626160","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9626291,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Wester","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Wester","id":"37089169535"},{"name":"Fredrik Heiding","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Heiding","id":"37089164963"},{"name":"Robert Lagerstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Lagerstr\u00f6m","id":"37587679600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4488-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4489-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-6605"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-6583"}],"articleNumber":"9626291","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Computational modeling","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic","Organizations","Computer networks","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection","IDS","Anomaly detection","Tree Augmented Naive Bayes","TAN","Machine learning","Network based intrusion detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626291","abstract":"Information technology is continuously becoming a more central part of society and together with the increased connectivity and inter-dependency of devices, it is becoming more important to keep systems secure. Most modern enterprises use some form of intrusion detection in order to detect hostile cyber activity that enters the organization. One of the major challenges of intrusion detection in computer networks is to detect types of intrusions that have previously not been encountered. These unknown intrusions are generally detected by methods collectively called anomaly detection. It is nowadays popular to use various artificial intelligence schemes to enhance anomaly detection of network traffic, and many state-of-the-art models reach a detection rate of well over 99%. One such promising algorithm is the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) Classifier. However, it is crucial to implement TAN correctly in order to benefit from its full performance. This study implements a TAN classifier for anomaly based intrusion detection of computer network traffic, and displays practical insights on how to maximize its performance.

First, an optimal clipping criterion (OCC) for signal quantization is proposed in order to minimize the precision of column analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at iso-accuracy. For a Gaussian distributed signal, the OCC is shown to reduce the column ADC precision requirements by 3 bits at a signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR) of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{22.5}\\,dB$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n over the commonly used full range (FR) quantizer. Next, the input-sliced weight-parallel (ISWP) IMC architecture is presented as a generalization of the popular bit-serial bit-parallel (BSBP) architecture.

Combining OCC and ISWP noise analysis, we map popular DNNs such as VGG-9 (CIFAR-10), ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10), and AlexNet (ImageNet) on a OCC-enabled ISWP architecture and show a reduction in energy consumption by an order-of-magnitude at iso-accuracy over the BSBP architecture that employs FR-based ADCs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3130488","startPage":"6462","endPage":"6472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3130488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09626555.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing Methods to Enhance the Energy Efficiency of In-Memory Computing Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626555/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing Methods to Enhance the Energy Efficiency of In-Memory Computing Architectures","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9626555/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingName":"Center for Brain-Inspired Computing"},{"fundingName":"DARPA's Foundations of Novel Compute program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Signal Processing Methods to Enhance the Energy Efficiency of In-Memory Computing Architectures","sourcePdf":"tsp-sakr-3130488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082778S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9626555","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9626612,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lu","affiliation":["York University, Toronto, Canada","Ericsson, Mississauga, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9626612/lu-3126616-small.gif","p":["Xiao Lu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008, the M.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2019.","He is currently with York University, Toronto, ON, Canada, and Ericsson, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

However, due to the limited computing and communication capabilities, wirelessly powered networks (WPNs) may be incapable of employing complex security practices, e.g., encryption, which may incur considerable computation and communication overheads. This challenge makes securing energy harvesting communications an arduous task and, thus, limits the use of WPNs in many high-security applications. In this context, security at the physical layer (PHY) that exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless medium to achieve secure communication has emerged as an alternative paradigm. This article first introduces the fundamental principles of primary PHY attacks, covering jamming, eavesdropping, and detection of covert, and then presents an overview of the prevalent countermeasures to secure both active and passive communications in WPNs. Furthermore, a number of open research issues are identified to inspire possible future research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Backscatter","Communication system

largely unsolved due to the complex dynamics and difficulty of state estimation. Learning-based approaches have recently accelerated progress, but generally depend heavily on large simulated datasets, human demonstrations or both. In this study, we propose a novel sample-efficient learning approach to deformable linear object manipulation (e.g. rope) that can be applied directly to the real world, without requiring any simulated or human demonstration data. We transform the observation and action space into a canonical image representation, allowing us to leverage the spatial structure preserving abilities of fully-convolutional networks to learn image-based predictive models. We name our approach Canonical Visual Forward model (CaVFM). We pair this learning approach with self-supervised data collection and learning on a real robot, and demonstrate its effectiveness at goal reaching tasks with only 1,000 samples of real-world data. Our method out-performs prior methods in this extreme low-data regime, without suffering performance loss when larger datasets are available.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Visualization","Deformable models","Task analysis","Data models","Planning","Grasping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning in grasping and manipulation","perception for grasping and manipulation","visual learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3130377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/9568780/09626655.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3130377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample-Efficient Learning of Deformable Linear Object Manipulation in the Real World Through Self-Supervision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample-Efficient Learning of Deformable Linear Object Manipulation in the Real World Through Self-Supervision","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626655/","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9626655/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample-Efficient Learning of Deformable Linear Object Manipulation in the Real World Through Self-Supervision","sourcePdf":"lra-lee-3130377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082526S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9568780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9568780","articleId":"9626655","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9626660,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeev Arulampalam","affiliation":["Maritime Division, Defence Science, and Technology Group, Edinburgh, SA, Australia","University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9626660/arula-3129599-small.gif","p":["Sanjeev Arulampalam (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and the B.E. degree (with First Class Hons.) in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia, in 1991 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, in 1998.

This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the performance degradation suffered by a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that neglects the signal propagation delay in the bearings-only fusion of heterogeneous sensors: one with negligible propagation delay and the other with non-negligible delay. By using a higher order Taylor-series based analysis, we derive approximate expressions for the bias and mean square error (MSE) of the MLE. The analysis shows that neglecting the propagation delay of a sensor (with non-negligible delay) in such bearings-only fusion problems leads to severe degradation in performance even when the signal speed is orders of magnitude higher than that of target. Simulation results confirm the validity of the theoretical predictions. Finally, a bias-compensated MLE is proposed that not only takes into account the propagation delay, but also compensates for the estimation bias. This bias-compensated MLE is nearly unbiased and exhibits an RMS error performance close to the Cramer Rao lower bound.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3129599","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09626660.pdf","startPage":"6488","endPage":"6503","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3129599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Propagation Delay Effects on Bearings-Only Fusion of Heterogeneous Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Propagation Delay Effects on Bearings-Only Fusion of Heterogeneous Sensors","volume":"69","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626660/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Propagation Delay Effects on Bearings-Only Fusion of Heterogeneous Sensors","sourcePdf":"tsp-arulampalam-3129599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080106S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9626660","onlineDate":"24 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9626724,"authors":[{"name":"Safae Rbihou","affiliation":["Engineering, Systems and Applications Laboratory, National School of Applied Sciences-ENSA, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University-USMBA, Fez, Morocco"],"firstName":"Safae","lastName":"Rbihou","id":"37089167808"},{"name":"Khalid Haddouch","affiliation":["Engineering, Systems and Applications Laboratory, National School of Applied Sciences-ENSA, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University-USMBA, Fez, Morocco"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Haddouch","id":"37071495300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4238-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4239-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9626724","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626724","abstract":"optimization problems currently occupy an important place in the scientific community. Intuitively, an optimization problem can be seen as a search problem that consists in exploring a space containing the set of all feasible solutions, in order to find the optimal solution. The traveling salesman problem (TSP), considered as a classical example of combinatorial optimization problem, is considered as an NP-complete problem. In this work we will divide the solution of combinatorial optimization problems into three classes: continuous Hopfield network (CHN), ant colony optimization (ACO) and exact methods programmed in Cplex. The solution of a CHN optimization problem is based on a certain energy or Lyapunov function, which decreases as the system evolves until it reaches a local minimum value. Ant colony optimization to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. As a special case, and in order to test these methods, some computational experiments solving the TSP are also included.","doi":"10.1109/ICDS53782.2021.9626724","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference On Intelligent Computing in Data Sciences (ICDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9626703/9626704/09626724.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Fifth International Conference On Intelligent Computing in Data Sciences (ICDS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDS53782.2021.9626724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study between a neural network, approach metaheuristic and exact method for solving Traveling salesman Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ant colony optimization","Neural networks","Metaheuristics","Hopfield neural networks","Traveling salesman problems","Search problems","Space exploration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks Hopfield traveling salesman problem","Ant colony algorithm","cplex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study between a neural network, approach metaheuristic and exact method for solving Traveling salesman Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9626724/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study between a neural network, approach metaheuristic and exact method for solving Traveling salesman Problem","confLoc":"Fez, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICDS2021_paper_29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052434S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9626703","isNumber":"9626704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9626703","xplore-issue":"9626704","articleId":"9626724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9626726,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios G.

Therefore, bug reports with high severity should have the highest priority to be fixed. A numerous number of bug reports are submitted daily through Bug Tracking Systems (BTS) such as Bugzilla. The bug triager examines the incoming bug reports manually and verifies whether the assigned severity level is correct or not. This manual process is time-consuming, requires much effort and is possibly error-prone. However, a limited number of research works have considered the sentiments of the bug reporters in predicting the severity of bug reports. This paper proposes two approaches based on sentiment analysis, the Lexicon-based and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network approaches. The sentiment analysis process determines and measures the sentiment words and their sentiment scores according to the popular sentiment lexicon called SentiWordNet. The proposed approaches are validated on the Eclipse open-source project, and the sentiment-based models performance is evaluated. According to the experimental results, the sentiment-based MLP outperforms the Lexicon-based approach (baseline approach). The F-measure has been improved significantly from 0.52 for the Lexicon-based approach to 0.81 when applying the MLP approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626730/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9626730/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sentiment-Based Neural Network Approach for Predicting the Severity of Bug Reports","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentiment-Based Neural Network Approach for Predicting the Severity of Bug Reports","confLoc":"Fez, Morocco","sourcePdf":"ICDS2021_paper_111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080756S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9626703","isNumber":"9626704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9626703","xplore-issue":"9626704","articleId":"9626730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9626910,"authors":[{"name":"Kouame Kouassi","affiliation":["University of Cape Town Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Kouame","lastName":"Kouassi","id":"37089176029"},{"name":"Deshendran Moodley","affiliation":["University of Cape Town Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Deshendran","lastName":"Moodley","id":"37086720847"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7377497-1-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1427-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9626910","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"abstract":"Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms have been explored for predicting trends in time series data.

This is due to the wide integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and their not predictable production.

The comparison is applied in forecasting of the most significant RES present in the Sicily zone (Italy), i.e., solar sources. To this aim, using the data of Gestore Servizi Energetici (GSE), both the AR and ANN architectures are built by exploiting the information available in time period 2010 \u2212 2015 in terms of temperatures and solar irradiation, thus obtaining a power forecasting for 2016 for each country of the Sicily zone. The performances of the two different methods are compared on the basis of both Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values. These two indexes are used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models.","doi":"10.23919/AEIT53387.2021.9626938","pdfPath":"/iel7/9626829/9626833/09626938.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 AEIT International Annual Conference (AEIT)","publicationTitle":"2021 AEIT International Annual Conference (AEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/AEIT53387.2021.9626938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Comparing Regressive and Artificial Neural Network Methods for Power System Forecast","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"On Comparing Regressive and Artificial Neural Network Methods for Power System Forecast","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"4 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626938/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Comparing Regressive and Artificial Neural Network Methods for Power System Forecast","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"ts14_p02_1570736340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126047S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9626829","isNumber":"9626833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9626829","xplore-issue":"9626833","articleId":"9626938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AEIT","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9626944,"authors":[{"name":"Zachary Baird","affiliation":["Radar Sensing and Exploitation Section, Defence Research and Development, Ottawa, Canada","Carleton University, Ottawa"],"firstName":"Zachary","lastName":"Baird"},{"name":"Michael K.

To address these issues, a portfolio management model is proposed that makes use of Deep Learning Models for weekly financial time series forecasting of returns. Our model uses a late fusion of an ensemble of forecast models and modifies the standard mean-variance optimiser to account for transaction costs, making it suitable for multi-period trading. Our empirical results show that our portfolio management tool outperforms the equally-weighted portfolio benchmark and the buy-and-hold strategy, using both Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit forecasts. Although the portfolios are profitable, they are also sub-optimal in terms of their risk to reward ratio. Therefore, greater forecasting accuracy is necessary to construct truly optimal portfolios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Costs","Sensitivity","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Benchmark testing","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","forecasting","financial time series","portfolio management"]}],"publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9626828/9626830/09626945.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Forecast Fusion and Optimal Portfolio Rebalancing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Forecast Fusion and Optimal Portfolio Rebalancing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626945/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626945/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Forecast Fusion and Optimal Portfolio Rebalancing","confLoc":"Sun City, South Africa","sourcePdf":"169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103234S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9626828","isNumber":"9626830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9626828","xplore-issue":"9626830","articleId":"9626945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF)","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9626955,"authors":[{"name":"Luisa Still","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics Fkie, Germany"],"firstName":"Luisa","lastName":"Still"},{"name":"Marc Oispuu","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics Fkie, Germany"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Oispuu"},{"name":"Wolfgang Koch","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics Fkie, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Koch"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7377497-1-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1427-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9626955","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Geometry","Sensor placement","Green products","Urban areas","Position measurement","Trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shooter localization","sensor placement","optimality","genetic algorithm","data fusion","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","muzzle blast","shock wave","microphone array","acoustic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9626955","abstract":"This paper proposes a method to find an optimal set of sensor positions for the shooter localization task.

The reason is that the computation of the for fusion required variance of NN is still a rather immature area. Here, we apply a methodology from system identification where uncertainty of the parameters in the NN are first estimated in the training phase, and then this uncertainty is propagated to the output in the prediction phase. This local approach is based on linearization, and it implicitly assumes a good signal-to-noise ratio and persistency of excitation. We illustrate the proposed method on a fundamental problem in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), namely to estimate the tire-road friction. This is a single input single output static nonlinear relation that is simple enough to provide insight and it enables comparisons with other parametric approaches. We compare both to existing methods for how to assess uncertainty in NN and standard methods for this problem, and evaluate on real data. The goal is not to improve on simpler methods for this particular application, but rather to validate that our method is on par with simpler model structures, where output variance is immediately provided.","pdfPath":"/iel7/9626828/9626830/09626974.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of the tire-road friction using neural networks including quantification of the prediction uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9626974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the tire-road friction using neural networks including quantification of the prediction uncertainty","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9626974/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"Vinnova"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the tire-road friction using neural networks including quantification of the prediction uncertainty","confLoc":"Sun City, South Africa","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072375S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9626828","isNumber":"9626830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9626828","xplore-issue":"9626830","articleId":"9626974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF)","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9627060,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Govaers","affiliation":["Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Govaers"},{"name":"Paul Baggenstoss","affiliation":["Fraunhofer FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Baggenstoss"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7377497-1-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1427-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9627060","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627060","abstract":"Data-driven classification based on deep learning provides overwhelming results in various applications.

The proposed DL-PDR scheme solves the movement change of smartphone users as a regression problem by combining IMU and global positioning system (GPS) data. In this paper, we (1) describe the existing PDR methods and problems, describe the proposed DL-PDR scheme and the data collection process of the input sensor data and output GPS used for deep learning, (2) correlate the collected I/O data and conduct preprocessing to make the data suitable for learning, (3) apply data refining and data augmentation methods to provide efficient learning and prevent overfitting, and (4) Verify the performance of the proposed scheme. The localization performance between the proposed scheme and existing methods is compared in various buildings where continuous localization is possible owing to connected indoor/outdoor spaces.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130605","startPage":"158616","endPage":"158631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09627132.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Based PDR Scheme That Fuses Smartphone Sensors and GPS Location Changes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based PDR Scheme That Fuses Smartphone Sensors and GPS Location Changes","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9627132/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627132/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and ICT","grantNumber":"2020R1A2C2010006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning-Based PDR Scheme That Fuses Smartphone Sensors and GPS Location Changes","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3130605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15037S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9627132","onlineDate":"25 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9627147,"authors":[{"name":"Jiafeng Zhou","affiliation":["University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9627147/zhou-3127493-small.gif","p":["Jiafeng Zhou (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in radio physics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2004.

According to the features of the electromagnetic field from the source to the receiver, WPT is divided into nonradiative near-field technology and radiative (near and far-field) technologies. Many different and important designs are reviewed and compared. It is shown that metamaterials and metasurfaces can significantly improve the power transfer efficiency and operational distance for WPT systems. They can also improve the energy conversion efficiency of wireless energy harvesters by making the reception less sensitive to incident wave angle and polarization. A rectenna is a critical element for both WPT and WEH. It is shown that metamaterial-based rectennas can achieve a higher RF to dc conversion efficiency. Furthermore, metamaterials can also be used as either parasitic elements or loading components to improve WEH performance in terms of circuit size, beamwidth, and conversion efficiency. Future development directions and opportunities of metamaterials and metasurfaces for WPT and WEH are also proposed in this article.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3127493","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9675003/09627147.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"55","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3127493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metamaterials and Metasurfaces for Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Metamaterials and Metasurfaces for Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting","volume":"110","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9627147/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society, U.K."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamaterials and Metasurfaces for Wireless Power Transfer and Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"jproc-zhou-3127493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.246899S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9627147","onlineDate":"25 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9627187,"authors":[{"name":"Yeting Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yeting","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Hancui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hancui","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4374-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4375-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9627187","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Roads","Conferences","Decision making","Software systems","Real-time systems","Safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle detection","assistant driving","multi-scale Yolov5","safety","video"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627187","abstract":"Vehicle affect the safety of people's daily life, and it is difficult to detect and discriminate the surrounding conditions of the vehicle because of a variety of object types and different sizes.

Due to the changing views of the sensor's observation, the objects feature often have large differences from different views, which lead to the failure of matching method based on image descriptors. Therefore, cross-view remote sensing image matching is a challenging work. We proposed a two-step cross-view image matching method based on deep neural networks: First, the pre-trained Faster RCNN object detection model is used to detect the drone images (search images) and we will get the targets region images through the detection results. Then, the optimized Siamese neural network model is used between the detection results (region images) and the satellite images (template images) to get the results of matching confidence. In this paper, comparative experiments were implemented on the university-1652 dataset, and the experimental results show that our method has excellent results on this benchmark database. The effectiveness of proposed method was demonstrated by evaluated on varying images, the R@10/%, and AP are 88.02% and 67.23% repectively.","doi":"10.1109/SmartCloud52277.2021.00031","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartCloud52277.2021.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627186","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9627073/9627186/09627208.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-view Matching Neural Network for Remote Sensing Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627208/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cross-view Matching Neural Network for Remote Sensing Images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9627208/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-view Matching Neural Network for Remote Sensing Images","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"437400a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060724S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9627073","isNumber":"9627186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9627073","xplore-issue":"9627186","articleId":"9627208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9627289,"authors":[{"name":"Andriana Ivanova","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, \u201cKonstantin Preslavsky\u201d University of Shumenz, Shumen, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Andriana","lastName":"Ivanova"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1042-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1043-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9627289","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Backpropagation","Additive noise","Image recognition","Transfer functions","Backpropagation algorithms","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed-forward neural network","symbol recognition","Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm","One step secant backpropagation algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627289","abstract":"This article proposes a feed-forward backpropagation neural network architecture for the automatic recognition of graphical symbols in the presence of high-level additive Gaussian noise based on machine learning (ML).

How to balance the computational load of multiple CPUs has become an urgent problem in the academic community in recent years. This paper uses BP neural network to predict the current weight of the smooth weighted round-robin algorithm by extracting the characteristics of the computer system and task graph characteristics, and then improves the smooth weighted round-robin algorithm.

It has been receiving much attention in recent years. The bidirectional long and short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) model has been well applied in the field of sentiment analysis because of its own characteristics. This experiment hopes to further explore the performance and application of the Bi-LSTM model in sentiment analysis. There are three main steps in the experiment. First, the collected Chinese reviews are segmented and vectorized. Then, the Bi-LSTM is trained and tested. Finally, the sentiment analysis result is obtained. With the help of the hyper-parameter adjustment and the dropout mechanism, the evaluation indicators of the experimental model have reached about 89%. What's more, based on the same experimental environment and experimental data, this experiment tested the accuracy of CNN, LSTM, CNN_LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. In addition, the trained Bi-LSTM was used to analyze reviews from Taobao and JD.COM. The specific operation is to collect reviews on a certain product from Taobao and JD.COM to perform a specific analysis with the model. Then find the advantages and disadvantages of the model in practical applications, so that the model can continue to be improved.","doi":"10.1109/ICISFall51598.2021.9627460","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/ACIS 20th International Fall Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS Fall)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISFall51598.2021.9627460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9627336","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/ACIS 20th International Fall Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS Fall)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9627232/9627336/09627460.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Chinese Sentiment Analysis Based on Bi-LSTM Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627460/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on Chinese Sentiment Analysis Based on Bi-LSTM Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9627460/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132018XNG1829"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Chinese Sentiment Analysis Based on Bi-LSTM Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093998S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9627232","isNumber":"9627336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9627232","xplore-issue":"9627336","articleId":"9627460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9627590,"authors":[{"name":"Craig Knuth","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Knuth","orcid":"0000-0002-2375-1427","id":"37088851710"},{"name":"Glen Chou","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Chou","orcid":"0000-0003-4444-3631","id":"37086482625"},{"name":"Necmiye Ozay","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Necmiye","lastName":"Ozay","orcid":"0000-0002-5552-4392","id":"37528553600"},{"name":"Dmitry Berenson","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Berenson","orcid":"0000-0002-9712-109X","id":"37542925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-3766"},{"format":"CD","value":"2377-3774"}],"articleNumber":"9627590","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Safety"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627590","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3127623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3127623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/9568780/09627590.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction to \u201cPlanning With Learned Dynamics: Probabilistic Guarantees on Safety and Reachability Via Lipschitz Constants\u201d","abstract":"We wish to make the following corrections and clarifications to our manuscript [1]. For a version of the manuscript that has these changes integrated into the text, please see [2]. \u2022In [1], the method is claimed to provide safety guarantees with probability $\\rho$; this probability should instead be $\\rho ^3$. This results from the Lipschitz constant estimation approach described in Sec. IV.B of [1] returning valid estimates with probability $\\rho$. Our method requires three Lipschitz constants: $L_{f-g}$ (the Lipschitz constant of the model error), $L_{g_0}$, and $L_{g_1}$ (the Lipschitz constants for each term in the learned control-affine dynamics). If independent samples are used to estimate each constant, and each estimate is valid with probability $\\rho$, the probability of all three estimates being valid is $\\rho ^3$. We note that it is possible to achieve the original safety probability of $\\rho$ if one can obtain guaranteed overapproximations of $L_{g_0}$ and $L_{g_1}$. In [1], we model $g_0$ and $g_1$ with neural networks, and there is an expanding body of work for more scalably obtaining a guaranteed (though potentially loose) overestimate of the Lipschitz constant for large networks, e.g. [3]. Moreover, this probability $\\rho ^3$ holds exactly only in the limit of infinite samples for estimating each Lipschitz constant. This is due to the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem [4], which justifies our Lipschitz estimation method, being an asymptotic result. \u2022The Weibull distribution we fit in Sec. IV.B of [1] is specifically the three-parameter reverse Weibulldistribution, which for a random variable $W$ has the cumulative distribution function \\begin{equation*} F_W(w) = {\\begin{cases}\\exp (-(\\frac{\\gamma - w}{\\alpha })^\\beta), & \\text {if } \\; w < \\gamma \\\\ 1, & \\text {if }\\; w \\geq \\gamma, \\end{cases}} \\end{equation*} where $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are the scale, shape, and location parameters, respectively. \u2022In line 6 of Algorithm 2 in [1], if $L_{f-g} \\geq 1$, then failure should be returned (as our planner requires $L_{f-g} < 1$). \u2022There is some notational confusion in [1] between $r$ (the radius of the balls used to define the trusted domain $D$) and $b_T$ (the dispersion of the dataset within $D$); please see [2] for the corrections.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9627590/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Correction to \u201cPlanning With Learned Dynamics: Probabilistic Guarantees on Safety and Reachability Via Lipschitz Constants\u201d","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1750489 and ECCS-1553873"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-21-1-2118 and N00014-18-1-2501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014037","fundingName":"National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction to \u201cPlanning With Learned Dynamics: Probabilistic Guarantees on Safety and Reachability Via Lipschitz Constants\u201d","sourcePdf":"lra-chou-3127623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09012S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"9568780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","xplore-issue":"9568780","articleId":"9627590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"Parent","associateDoi":"10.1109/LRA.2021.3068889","associateId":"9387079"}]},{"_id":9627641,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Collas","affiliation":["SONDRA, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Collas","orcid":"0000-0003-1945-462X"},{"name":"Florent Bouchard","affiliation":["CNRS, L2S, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Bouchard","orcid":"0000-0003-3003-7317"},{"name":"Arnaud Breloy","affiliation":["LEME (EA4416), University Paris Nanterre, Ville-d\u2019Avray, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Breloy","orcid":"0000-0002-3802-9015"},{"name":"Guillaume Ginolhac","affiliation":["LISTIC (EA3703), University Savoie Mont Blanc, Chamb\u00e9ry, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Ginolhac","orcid":"0000-0001-9318-028X"},{"name":"Chengfang Ren","affiliation":["SONDRA, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Chengfang","lastName":"Ren","orcid":"0000-0001-8438-4539"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","affiliation":["SONDRA, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay and DEMR, ONERA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Ovarlez","orcid":"0000-0001-8056-4196"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9627641","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Measurement","Manifolds","Principal component analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covariance matrices","probabilistic pca","heteroscedastic data","robust estimation","Riemannian optimization","clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627641","abstract":"This paper studies a statistical model for heteroscedastic (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>\n, power fluctuating) signals embedded in white Gaussian noise.

Research related to precision agriculture is of high relevance due to its potential economic impact on agricultural productivity and quality. Within this context, we propose a deep learning-based feature extraction method for the identification of plant species and the classification of plant leaf diseases. We focus on results relevant to real-time processing scenarios that can be easily transferred to manned/unmanned agricultural smart machinery (e.g. tractors, drones, robots, IoT smart sensor networks, etc.) by reconsidering the common processing pipeline. In our approach, texture features are extracted from different layers of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models and are later applied to a machine-learning classifier. For the experimental evaluation, we used publicly available datasets consisting of RGB textured images and datasets containing images of healthy and non-healthy plant leaves of different species. We compared our method to feature vectors derived from traditional handcrafted feature extraction descriptors computed for the same images and end-to-end deep-learning approaches. The proposed method proves to be significantly more efficient in terms of processing times and discriminative power, being able to surpass traditional and end-to-end CNN-based methods and provide a solution also to the problem of the reduced datasets available for precision agriculture.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131002","startPage":"160085","endPage":"160103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09627678.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Texture Feature Extraction.

Hence, it is helpful to consult the structural insight provided by traditional optimization algorithms, the results of which are interpretable. Inspired by this concept, we propose a fast, light, easily interpreted, and relatively stable learning-based method for solving image CS problems. This method is termed the Generalized ProXimal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers Network (GPX-ADMM-Net) and can be used to solve image CS problems that conventionally are solved using optimization algorithms with intensive computations. GPX-ADMM-Net features the following characteristics: (1) It achieves a higher or comparable performance with state-of-the-art learning-based methods for the image CS problem in terms of reconstruction quality, running speed, and storage cost. (2) Because our method strictly follows the insight of optimization algorithms, it possesses a measurement rate (MR) adaptivity able to reconstruct acceptable image qualities under different MRs with only a single set of trained parameters, which is a unique property in learning-based methods. (3) Despite its dedicated design for the image CS problem, it possesses a cross-task adaptivity extended to handle other image inverse problems (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>\n, super-resolution and inpainting) that are treated as a special case of CS.

However, this advantage comes from the high computational complexity of the DNNs in use. Hence, it is becoming increasingly important to scale these DNNs so that they can fit on resource-constrained hardware and edge devices. The main goal is to allow efficient processing of the DNNs on low-power micro-AI platforms without compromising hardware resources and accuracy. In this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey about the recent developments in the domain of energy-efficient deployment of DNNs on micro-AI platforms. To this extent, we look at different neural architecture search strategies as part of micro-AI model design, provide extensive details about model compression and quantization strategies in practice, and finally elaborate on the current hardware approaches towards efficient deployment of the micro-AI models on hardware. The main takeaways for a reader from this article will be understanding of different search spaces to pinpoint the best micro-AI model configuration, ability to interpret different quantization and sparsification techniques, and the realization of the micro-AI models on resource-constrained hardware and different design considerations associated with it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 November 2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9627710/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on the Optimization of Neural Network Accelerators for Micro-AI On-Device Inference","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey on the Optimization of Neural Network Accelerators for Micro-AI On-Device Inference","sourcePdf":"jetcas-mazumder-3129415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133907S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9627710","onlineDate":"25 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9627714,"authors":[{"name":"Lizhen Chen","affiliation":["International Collaborative Laboratory of 2D Materials for Opto-Electronics Science and Technology and the Engineering Technology Research Center for 2D Material Information Function Devices and Systems of Guangdong Province, Institute of Microscale Optoelectronics, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lizhen Chen received the B.S. degree in physics and optoelectronics engineering from Shenzhen University, China, in 2019, where she is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree with the College of Physics and Optoelectronics Engineering.

However, due to the system limitation, the length of sampled signal would be not equal to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{L}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Thus, zero-padding is performed on the signal before FFT operation. Most traditional sinusoidal frequency estimation methods are for signals without zero-padding. When applying these methods to the zero-padded signal, the performances would degrade. To solve this problem, a novel frequency estimation method for zero-padded signal is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, by using the analytical expression of the DFT signal after zero-padding, an amplitude ratio function is defined between the two DFT samples nearest to the true frequency. Based on the monotonic property of the ratio function, Newton-Raphson method or bisection search is used to estimate the residual frequency.

Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better RMSE performance than the traditional methods.

Central to this objective-UQ is the concept of mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU), which provides effective means of quantifying the impact of uncertainty on the operational goals at hand. MOCU is especially useful for optimal experimental design (OED) as the potential efficacy of an experimental (or data acquisition) campaign can be quantified by estimating the MOCU that is expected to remain after the campaign. However, MOCU-based OED tends to be computationally expensive, which limits its practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML) scheme that can significantly accelerate MOCU computation and expedite MOCU-based experimental design. The main idea is to use an ML model to efficiently search for the optimal robust operator under model uncertainty, a necessary step for computing MOCU. We apply the proposed ML-based OED acceleration scheme to design experiments aimed at optimally enhancing the control performance of uncertain Kuramoto oscillator models. Our results show that the proposed scheme results in up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${154}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-fold speed improvement without any degradation of the OED performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 November 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9627786/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Optimal Experimental Design for Robust Synchronization of Uncertain Kuramoto Oscillator Model Using Machine Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1835690"},{"fundingName":"DOE","grantNumber":"DE-SC0019303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010449","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2021R1A2C1093579"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT and future planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2020R1A2C1A01009184"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Optimal Experimental Design for Robust Synchronization of Uncertain Kuramoto Oscillator Model Using Machine Learning","sourcePdf":"tsp-woo-3130967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108172S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9627786","onlineDate":"26 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9627816,"authors":[{"name":"Qiangqiang Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9627816/zhang-3130964-small.gif","p":["Qiangqiang Zhang (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree from the College of Science and Technology, Sanya University, Hainan, China.

To address these two issues and apply ASLM into adaptive filtering, online ASLM algorithms with a weighted \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n nearest neighbor (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-NN) method, based on an updated orthogonal error table, are therefore proposed in this paper. To further improve the robustness of ASLM to heavy-tail noises, a robust ASLM (RASLM) algorithm is proposed with the help of kernel function, and thus a novel robust adaptive filtering algorithm named maximum correntropy criterion RASLM (MCC-RASLM) is developed based the maximum correntropy criterion. However, the linear growth error table existing in MCC-RASLM incurs an ever-growing computational burden. Therefore, to reduce the computational complexity of MCC-RASLM, another novel online variable-centroid clustering is proposed to generate a maximum correntropy criterion cluster RASLM (MCC-C-RASLM) algorithm.

This paper inno-vatively proposes a wavelet neural network (WNN) model optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and chaos optimization algorithm (COA) for short-term load prediction of IES. The proposed model overcomes the disadvantages of the slow convergence and the tendency to fall into the local optimum in traditional WNN models. First, the Pearson correlation coefficient is employed to select the key influencing factors of load prediction. Then, the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) is improved by the dynamic particle inertia weight. To jump out of the local optimum, the COA is employed to search for individual optimal particles in IPSO. In the iteration, the parameters of WNN are continually optimized by IPSO-COA. Meanwhile, the feedback link is added to the proposed model, where the output error is adopted to \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mo</sup>\ndify the prediction results. Finally, the proposed model is employed for load prediction. The experimental simulation verifies that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy and operation efficiency compared with the artificial neural network (ANN), WNN, and PSO-WNN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"SGEPRI","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9627862/","publicationDate":"November 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-term Load Prediction of Integrated Energy System with Wavelet Neural Network Model Based on Improved Particle Swarm Optimization and Chaos Optimization Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1500800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51807134"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Short-term Load Prediction of Integrated Energy System with Wavelet Neural Network Model Based on Improved Particle Swarm Optimization and Chaos Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"023_2020_000647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094702S","chronDate":"November  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8685265","isNumber":"9627863","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8685265","xplore-issue":"9627863","articleId":"9627862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"MPCE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9627907,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel L.

However, despite the tight integration of cyber and physical components in modern critical infrastructures, the monitoring of cyber and physical subsystems is still done separately. For successful health monitoring of such systems, a holistic approach is needed. This paper presents an approach for holistic health monitoring of cyber-physical systems based on cyber and physical anomaly detection and correlation. We provide a data-driven approach for the detection of cyber and physical anomalies based on machine learning. The benefits of the presented approach are: 1) integrated architecture that supports the acquisition and real-time analysis of both cyber and physical data; 2) a metric for holistic health monitoring that allows for differentiation between physical faults, cyber intrusion, and cyber-physical attacks. We present experimental analysis on a power-grid use case using the IEEE-33 bus model. The system was tested on several types of attacks such as network scan, Denial of Service (DOS), and malicious command injections.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Anomaly detection","Measurement","Machine learning algorithms","Switches","Real-time systems","Machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","cyber-physical systems","system health monitoring","cyber and physical anomalies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09627907.pdf","startPage":"163138","endPage":"163150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Correlation of Cyber and Physical Anomalies for Holistic System Health Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Correlation of Cyber and Physical Anomalies for Holistic System Health Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627907/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9627907/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) through the Solar Energy Technology Office","grantNumber":"DE-0008775"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016186","fundingName":"Department of Energy through the U.S. DOE Idaho Operations Office","grantNumber":"DE-AC07-05ID14517"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011660","fundingName":"Resilient Control and Instrumentation Systems (ReCIS) Program of Idaho National Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, an Investment in the Advancement of Cyber Research and Development, Innovation and Workforce Development (cyberinitiative.org)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Driven Correlation of Cyber and Physical Anomalies for Holistic System Health Monitoring","sourcePdf":"access-marino-3131274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125005S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9627907","onlineDate":"29 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9627910,"authors":[{"name":"Ahlam Althobaiti","affiliation":["School of Computing & Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Ahlam Althobaiti (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the master\u2019s degree in computer science from the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2016.

Smart grids are envisioned to be the next generation innovative power systems, guaranteeing resilience, reliability and sustainability and to facilitate energy production, distribution and management. Nonetheless, the development of such systems entails challenges covering a broad spectrum ranging from operational management up to data-driven power accounting and network security. Given the highly distributed properties of the modern grid, energy theft can now be observed at various transmission and distribution levels. Apart from the financial gain for a malicious actor, energy theft can also affect critical grid processes with a direct impact on its overall resilience and safety. This survey reviews recent energy theft strategies as well as detection methods from a data-driven perspective. By considering various operational and functional layers within modern smart grids we critically assess how energy theft can be formulated. Moreover, we provide an overview of the grid demand, supply and control chain with a focus on energy theft and associated security flaws that currently exist in the smart grid ecosystem. Different attack detection models for theft detection in the smart grid are categorized. Lastly, we discuss various open issues in the scope of data-driven energy theft detection methods and provide future directions to carry out research in this field.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131220","startPage":"159291","endPage":"159312","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09627910.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Theft in Smart Grids: A Survey on Data-Driven Attack Strategies and Detection Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy Theft in Smart Grids: A Survey on Data-Driven Attack Strategies and Detection Methods","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9627910/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9627910/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU H2020 EASY-RES Project","grantNumber":"764090"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006261","fundingName":"Taif University and the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia Cultural Bureau"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Theft in Smart Grids: A Survey on Data-Driven Attack Strategies and Detection Methods","sourcePdf":"access-althobaiti-3131220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.213937S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9627910","onlineDate":"29 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9627925,"authors":[{"name":"Raluca Chitic","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9627925/chiti-3131255-small.gif","p":["Raluca Chitic received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the M.Sc. degree in artificial intelligence.

In most cases, only the daily extremes or mean temperatures are provided by temperature forecasting methods. However, with the growing availability of data and the development of deep neural networks (DNNs) capable of detecting complex relationships, high-resolution temperature forecasting is becoming easier. Typically, historical temperature data along with multiple meteorological sensor data is used for temperature forecasting which increases the complexity of the system making it harder and costlier to implement physically. In this paper, high-resolution hourly temperature forecasting is performed using only historical temperature data. The paper presents a comparative analysis among four popular DNNs-simple recurrent neural network (SRN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), long-short term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and two hybrid models-CNN-LSTM parallel network and GRU-LSTM parallel network trained on Beijing temperature dataset. Experimental results showed GRU-LSTM parallel network obtained the lowest RMSE (1.691\u00b0 C) whereas CNN has the best computational efficiency obtaining a slightly worse RMSE (1.759\u00b0 C). Additionally, a robustness analysis is performed on temperature data from four additional geographically diverse locations (Toronto, Las Vegas, Seattle, and Dallas) which reveals GRU to be the most consistent algorithm. Finally, the paper establishes a correlation between the model performance and the dataset based on their variance and mean absolute deviation with reference to the training dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131533","startPage":"160646","endPage":"160660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09628089.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Deep Neural Networks for Hourly Temperature Forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature distribution","Forecasting","Predictive models","Temperature sensors","Load modeling","Data models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","CNN","LSTM","CNN-LSTM parallel","temperature forecasting","GRU","RNN","GRU-LSTM parallel","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Analysis of Deep Neural Networks for Hourly Temperature Forecasting","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9628089/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Comparative Analysis of Deep Neural Networks for Hourly Temperature Forecasting","sourcePdf":"access-tabassum-3131533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075889S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9628089","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9628126,"authors":[{"name":"Kooksung Jun","affiliation":["School of Integrated Technology, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9628126/jun-3131613-small.gif","p":["Kooksung Jun received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degree in intelligent robotics from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Many machine learning-based approaches have been proposed that automatically classify abnormal gait patterns using various sensors, such as inertial sensors, depth cameras and foot pressure plates. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based abnormal gait classification method employing both a 3D skeleton (obtained with a depth camera) and plantar foot pressure. We collected skeleton and foot pressure data simultaneously for 1 normal and 5 pathological (antalgic, lurching, steppage, stiff-legged, and Trendelenburg) gaits and classified them by using a multimodal hybrid model fed both data types together. In the proposed method, we fed the sequential skeleton and average foot pressure data into recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoding layers and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoding layers, respectively, to effectively extract features from different data types. Their output features were concatenated and fed to fully connected layers for classification. The pressure-based and skeleton-based single-modal models achieved classification accuracies of 68.82% and 93.40%, respectively. The proposed multimodal hybrid model showed improved performance with an accuracy of 95.66%. We fine-tuned the hybrid model by applying a 3-step training methodology and ultimately increased the accuracy to 97.60%. This study indicates that the integrated features of the skeleton and foot pressure data represent both the spatiotemporal motion information and weight distribution, so data fusion can generate a positive effect in pathological gait classification.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131613","startPage":"161576","endPage":"161589","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09628126.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Abnormal Gait Classification Using a 3D Skeleton and Plantar Foot Pressure","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"IEEE DataPort","type":"dataset","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes datasets submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.21227/ev8a-wr16","name":"AZURE KINECT 3D SKELETON AND FOOT PRESSURE DATA FOR PATHOLOGICAL GAITS"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Abnormal Gait Classification Using a 3D Skeleton and Plantar Foot Pressure","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9628126/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628126/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of Korea","grantNumber":"20003762"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002582","fundingName":"Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Abnormal Gait Classification Using a 3D Skeleton and Plantar Foot Pressure","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3131613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182106S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9628126","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9628167,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqiang Gu","affiliation":["Poly-GRAMES Research Center, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9628167/gu-3127930-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqiang Gu (Member, IEEE) was born in Changzhou, China, in 1990.

In addition to its linguistic message, the speech signal also carries information about, for example, the gender and age of the speaker. Moreover, the speech signal includes acoustical cues about several speaker traits, such as the emotional state and the state of health of the speaker. In order to understand the production of these acoustical cues by the human speech production mechanism and utilize this information in speech technology, it is necessary to extract features describing both the excitation and the filter of the human speech production mechanism. While the methods to estimate and parameterize the vocal tract system are well established, the excitation appears less studied. This article provides a review of signal processing approaches used for the extraction of excitation information from speech. This article highlights the importance of excitation information in the analysis and classification of phonation type and vocal emotions, in the analysis of nonverbal laughter sounds, and in studying pathological voices. Furthermore, recent developments of deep learning techniques in the context of extraction and utilization of the excitation information are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9645052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3126493","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3126493","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1941","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9645052/09628174.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628174","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628174/","displayDocTitle":"Extraction and Utilization of Excitation Information of Speech: A Review","volume":"109","issue":"12","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9628174/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"330139"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Extraction and Utilization of Excitation Information of Speech: A Review","sourcePdf":"jproc-kadiri-3126493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.318353S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9645052","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9645052","articleId":"9628174","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9628201,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiko Takahashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Takahashi"},{"name":"Sora Shibata","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Sora","lastName":"Shibata"},{"name":"Masafumi Hashimoto","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Hashimoto"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1650-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1651-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2767-7257"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2767-7230"}],"articleNumber":"9628201","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628201","abstract":"This study investigates the learning capability of a quaternion recurrent neural network that is trained based on a backpropagation through time algorithm extended to quaternion numbers.

The large influx of patients in hospitals is a fatal problem for the hospital management systems. The patient crowding problem can cause potential consequences, including increased mortality rate, unnecessary labor cost, poor customer service, ambulance divergence, and cancelation of equipment. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize machine learning to prevent overcrowding and enhance resource allocation. This research study has used the openly available dataset of patients and a combination of machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree to analyze patient admission trends for effective decision making.

Firstly, by investigating the effect of the PV active power curtailment on the voltage regulation, a mathematical optimization model is built.

As the ANN configurations proposed in recent literature were trained under different training parameters and datasets, a fair comparison cannot be made by directly referring to the prediction errors reported. Thus, the SOC prediction performance of the ANNs proposed in the recent years were investigated, by training with same training parameters and dataset (US06 vehicle dynamic profile from the Centre of Advanced Life Cycle Engineering). Results show that the testing dataset Mean Squared Error (MSE) for using only Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is 3.140%, whereas combining CNN with Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM-RNN) is 1.820%, and CNN with Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU-RNN) is 1.819% MSE. Therefore, it is evident that in-cooperation of any form of recurrent architecture in an ANN configuration contributes to better SOC prediction. The results also highlight that inclusion of a bidirectional recurrent architecture such as Bidirectional LSTM-RNN (MSE: 0.927%) and attention mechanism such as the combination of LSTM-RNN with attention (MSE: 0.004%) contribute to better SOC prediction. Overall, the performance analysis conducted shows that there is a need in further research investigation on integrating different types of bidirectional recurrent architecture and attention mechanism with other ANNs and evaluate the SOC prediction performance as compared to previously proposed ANN configurations. Successful testing and implementation would contribute to increased battery life span and reduced maintenance costs, leading to increased usage of EVs.","doi":"10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628725","startPage":"176","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628147/9628412/09628725.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis on Artificial Neural Network Based State of Charge Estimation for Electric Vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Lithium-ion batteries","Estimation","Maintenance engineering","Electric vehicles","Performance analysis","State of charge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State of Charge","Artificial Neural Networks","Electric Vehicles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis on Artificial Neural Network Based State of Charge Estimation for Electric Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9628725/","publicationDate":"23 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis on Artificial Neural Network Based State of Charge Estimation for Electric Vehicles","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570749196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089032S","chronDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628147","isNumber":"9628412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628147","xplore-issue":"9628412","articleId":"9628725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9628735,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University, Cheng du, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089179773"},{"name":"Bin Gou","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University, Cheng du, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Gou","id":"38467432800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1360-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1361-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9628735","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Fault detection","Rectifiers","Pulse width modulation","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["online fault diagnosis","single-phase PWM rectifier","Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)","nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX)","logical judgment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628735","abstract":"In power electronical traction transformer, the failure of the single-phase PWM rectifier will lead to irreparable degradation of the system. Thus, this article proposes a feasible data-driven method to diagnose both the current sensor faults and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) open-circuit faults of single-phase PWM rectifier online. The principle of the method is to construct a signal predictor by combining nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model and an advanced learning algorithm, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Then the faults are detected based on the residual between the signal output of the predictor and the sensor. Furthermore, the faults are identified by logical judgment based on the system fault performance. Several hardware-in-loop tests are implemented to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method. Test results show that this method has a very fast speed to detect the faults within 1 ms and a high accuracy to classify different faults.","doi":"10.1109/PEAS53589.2021.9628735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEAS53589.2021.9628735","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Power Electronics and Application Symposium (PEAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628142/9628395/09628735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Power Electronics and Application Symposium (PEAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Method for Online Fault Diagnosis in Single-Phase PWM Rectifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Method for Online Fault Diagnosis in Single-Phase PWM Rectifier","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"13 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9628735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628735/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Method for Online Fault Diagnosis in Single-Phase PWM Rectifier","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"156_H0432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081879S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628142","isNumber":"9628395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628142","xplore-issue":"9628395","articleId":"9628735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9628775,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Ferdy Susila","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Michael Ferdy","lastName":"Susila"},{"name":"Budhi Irawan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Budhi","lastName":"Irawan"},{"name":"Casi Setianingsih","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Casi","lastName":"Setianingsih"},{"name":"Dony Tontiardo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Dony","lastName":"Tontiardo"},{"name":"Adli Farhan Ibrahim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adli Farhan","lastName":"Ibrahim"},{"name":"Elvin Nur Furqon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Elvin Nur","lastName":"Furqon"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2035-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2036-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9628775","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628775","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Conferences","Crops","Training data","Biology","Convolutional neural networks","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Leaf Diseases","Bok choy","CNN","Image Processing."]}],"doi":"10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628775","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628147/9628412/09628775.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bok Choy Leaf Diseases Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network Method","abstract":"One of the essential factors in human life is food obtained from the agricultural sector. The farming process utilizes biological resources to be processed into food, industrial materials, energy sources and manage the environment. In Indonesia, the agricultural sector is divided into the wet sector and the dry sector. One of the problems in the agricultural sector is pests and diseases. Pests and diseases often disrupt plant growth. Pests and diseases can cause crop failure because they often infect the product to be harvested, be it fruit or plants. One of the plants that are often disturbed in its development is Bok Choy. Implementing a disease detection system with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is expected to help farmers detect problems early, reducing crop failure.

When the same control system is applied to different topologies and modulation methods, the traditional modulation scheme needs cumbersome and error-prone operations because a large number of control bits need to be configured. In this paper, a universal modulation scheme is proposed based on the idea of event-driven. The data transmission between processor and logic cells is abstracted as an event and the configuration of control bits is omitted. The processor adds an event calculation process that is easy to modify as an event collector. The circuit in the logic cells is simplified to a single unified carrier, which greatly saves the hardware resources and increases the universality. Compared with the traditional scheme, it can be found that the proposed scheme has the following advantages: it is more convenient and flexible to switch in different applications; it reduces the complexity of logic cells and the consumption of hardware resources. The proposed scheme is analyzed and the feasibility of the scheme is verified by experiments on a self-developed medium voltage controller taking the five-level nested neutral point piloted topology as an example.","doi":"10.1109/PEAS53589.2021.9628790","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Power Electronics and Application Symposium (PEAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 1st International Power Electronics and Application Symposium (PEAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628142/9628395/09628790.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEAS53589.2021.9628790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628790/","displayDocTitle":"A Universal Modulation Scheme Based on Event-driven in Medium Voltage Converter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9628790/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Universal Modulation Scheme Based on Event-driven in Medium Voltage Converter","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"072_B0313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050841S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628142","isNumber":"9628395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628142","xplore-issue":"9628395","articleId":"9628790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9628830,"authors":[{"name":"Surya Muhammad","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Surya","lastName":"Muhammad"},{"name":"Roswan Latuconsina","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Roswan","lastName":"Latuconsina"},{"name":"Casi Setianingsih","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Casi","lastName":"Setianingsih"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2035-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2036-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9628830","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628830","abstract":"The increasing number of events usually formed a committee in small to large fields involving event organizers. In this study, the survey results were used to Telkom University students in Roadshow, Try Out and other committees. However, there are often problems in the implementation process caused by poor planning and supervision processes to have less clear financial statements. To anticipate this problem and create a web application-based event management application that provides appropriate budget recommendations. So, by using Genetics Algorithm is an optimization algorithm that can provide optimal results. This application is expected to help financial management reduce errors in the budgeting creation process and provide recommendations to users. Based on the test results, three experiments were carried out to see the optimal fitness value. In the first test, the densest optimal fitness value is between the \u00b1 18 th generation out of a total of 50 generations. In the second experiment, the optimal fitness value is between the 20th generation to the 30th generation. In the last experiment, the optimal fitness value is between the 2nd generation to the 10th generation. This difference occurs because the random values used in each experiment are different. In this study, the genetic algorithm succeeded in recommending goods that match the maximum budget parameters of the division, indoor or outdoor category.","doi":"10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628830","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628147/9628412/09628830.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IoTaIS53735.2021.9628830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Budgeting System In Event Management Application Using Web-Based Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Financial management","Planning","Internet of Things","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Knapsack Problem","Event Management","Budgeting","Web Application"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Budgeting System In Event Management Application Using Web-Based Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9628830/","publicationDate":"23 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Budgeting System In Event Management Application Using Web-Based Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570740842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051627S","chronDate":"23-24 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628147","isNumber":"9628412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628147","xplore-issue":"9628412","articleId":"9628830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9628906,"authors":[{"name":"Redouane Kaibou","affiliation":["Laboratoire Syst\u00e8mes \u00c9lectroniques et Num\u00e9riques \u00c9cole Militaire Polytechnique, Alger, Alg\u00e9rie"],"firstName":"Redouane","lastName":"Kaibou","id":"37087317667"},{"name":"Mohamed Salah Azzaz","affiliation":["Laboratoire Syst\u00e8mes \u00c9lectroniques et Num\u00e9riques \u00c9cole Militaire Polytechnique, Alger, Alg\u00e9rie"],"firstName":"Mohamed Salah","lastName":"Azzaz","id":"37399645900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2821-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2822-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9628906","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Mixed Robust Chaos-based Digital Color Image Watermarking","abstract":"In this article, a hardware implementation of an invisible watermarking system has been proposed using Cyclone IV-E \u2019EP4CE115F29C7\u2019 FPGA board of ALTERA company.

In this paper, we present a deep learning framework \u2014 Adaptive Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (ADCGAN) \u2014 that we have developed and researched, and which has demonstrated the ability to generate realistic fingerprint samples that are similar to real ones in terms of their feature spectrum. ADCGAN makes it possible to conduct fingerprint research, without restrictions related to the confidential nature of biometric data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Image synthesis","Image matching","Biological system modeling","Fingerprint recognition","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","artificial intelligence","generative adversarial network","fingerprints","sample"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICT52120.2021.9628978","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Advanced Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Advanced Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628152/9628889/09628978.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT52120.2021.9628978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Deep Convolutional GAN for Fingerprint Sample Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9628978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Deep Convolutional GAN for Fingerprint Sample Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9628978/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"21 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9628978/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Deep Convolutional GAN for Fingerprint Sample Synthesis","confLoc":"Lviv, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"file041_p193-196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044617S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628152","isNumber":"9628889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628152","xplore-issue":"9628889","articleId":"9628978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9629003,"authors":[{"name":"Erez Loebl","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Erez","lastName":"Loebl"},{"name":"Nimrod Ginzberg","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Nimrod","lastName":"Ginzberg"},{"name":"Emanuel Cohen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"Cohen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3557-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9629003","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Microwave antennas","Interference cancellation","Transmitters","Artificial neural networks","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communications","neural networks","digital predistortion","self-interference cancellation","full-duplex"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629003","abstract":"This work presents a neural network (NN) implementation of a digital self-interference cancellation (SIC) filter and a digital predistortion (DPD) linearizer in a quadrature balanced full duplex (FD) transceiver front-end.

In this work, we evaluate the core element of SNN, the neuron circuit equivalent, in terms of temperature robustness for automotive applications. Thanks to the operating point stabilization, the proposed circuit-level neuron implementation achieves a broad frequency tuning range up to 42 MHz and operates over a wide temperature range from \u221240 \u00b0C to 125 \u00b0C. At the maximum spiking frequency of 42 MHz, the circuit consumes a DC power of only 300 nW. We use the proposed neuron circuit to realize two fundamental logic gates, AND and OR, by means of analog rate-encoded spiking neural networks. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, these are the first reported SNN-based logic gates measured over the automotive temperature range. We showcase the suitability of SNN circuit implementation for automotive applications. The circuits are realized in a 130 nm BiCMOS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiking Neural Networks based Rate-Coded Logic Gates for Automotive Applications in BiCMOS","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS52219.2021.9629011","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Antennas, Communications and Electronic Systems (COMCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9628186/9628993/09629011.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Antennas, Communications and Electronic Systems (COMCAS)","startPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS52219.2021.9629011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9628993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629011","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Microwave antennas","Temperature distribution","Neurons","Automotive applications","Logic gates","BiCMOS integrated circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural Networks based Rate-Coded Logic Gates for Automotive Applications in BiCMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9629011/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Neural Networks based Rate-Coded Logic Gates for Automotive Applications in BiCMOS","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"1570735493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095668S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9628186","isNumber":"9628993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9628186","xplore-issue":"9628993","articleId":"9629011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9629088,"authors":[{"name":"Kobi Ben Atar","affiliation":["School of electrical engineering, Tel-Aviv University"],"firstName":"Kobi Ben","lastName":"Atar","id":"37089182369"},{"name":"Eran Socher","affiliation":["School of electrical engineering, Tel-Aviv University"],"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Socher","id":"37371220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3557-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9629088","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629088","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave antennas","Power dividers","Millimeter wave technology","Layout","Power amplifiers","Microwave communication","Transformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter-wave","power amplifier","wireless","G-band","THz","CMOS"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of a 204GHz power amplifier fabricated in TSMC 65nm CMOS process.

It investigates mechanisms behind the origin of complexity based on local activity, which characterizes the behavior of this outstanding nanodevice. We propose an accurate, particularly simplified version of a recently introduced physical model suitable for large-scale circuit simulations. Following the concept of local activity, we then conduct a small-signal circuit-theoretic derivation of the impedance and associated small-signal equivalent circuit elements to analyze device stability and frequency response. Finally, our analysis reveals locally active operating regions, as well as regions where the device dynamics are positioned on the edge of chaos. The latter regions are crucial for designing bio-inspired computing systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NbO<sub>2</sub>-Mott Memristor: A Circuit- Theoretic Investigation","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126657","endPage":"4992","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09629238.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"4979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stationary state","Memristors","Circuit theory","Mathematical models","Stability analysis","Frequency response","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device model","circuit theory","local activity","edge of chaos","NbO\u2082-Mott memristor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NbO<sub>2</sub>-Mott Memristor: A Circuit- Theoretic Investigation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"68","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9629238/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"USA","grantNumber":"FA 9550-18-1-0016"},{"fundingName":"X-Grants Program of the President\u2019s Excellence Fund at Texas A&M University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NbO<sub>2</sub>-Mott Memristor: A Circuit- Theoretic Investigation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-messaris-3126657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118266S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9629238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9629320,"authors":[{"name":"Qinglei Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxiville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9629320/cao-3131657-small.gif","p":["Qinglei Cao received the BS degree in information and computational science from Hunan University and the MS degree in computer application technology from the Ocean University of China.

The objective can be multi-dimensional, such as improving computational load balance or decreasing communication volume or cost, with the ultimate goal of increasing the efficiency and therefore reducing the time-to-solution for the algorithm. The classic redistribution problem focuses on optimally scheduling communications when reshuffling data between two regular, usually block-cyclic, data distributions. Besides distribution, data size is also a performance-critical parameter because it affects the reshuffling algorithm in terms of cache, communication efficiency, and potential parallelism. In addition, task-based runtime systems have gained popularity recently as a potential candidate to address the programming complexity on the way to exascale. In this scenario, it becomes paramount to develop a flexible redistribution algorithm for task-based runtime systems, which could support all types of regular and irregular data distributions and take data size into account. In this article, we detail a flexible redistribution algorithm and implement an efficient approach in a task-based runtime system, \n<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PaRSEC</monospace>\n.

A peculiarity of a DAW environment is that most of the work is highly parallelizable, since the basic architecture of a DAW consists in the simultaneous processing of different audio tracks, mainly independent from each other. In order to exploit such a feature, this paper proposes an interface that lets the DAW interact with the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in a standardized way. Despite some academic research and experimentation, the professional audio software industry almost never exploited GPUs when implementing entire DAWs, but only when realising very specific tools or third party extensions (plugins). This work also presents and discusses the outcomes of a number of tests conducted in order to choose the optimal architecture. As a result, a GPU-based approach turned to be a valid alternative to the use of CPUs in the computation of audio effects, such as the rendering of audio tracks after mixing and mastering operations, both in real time and offline.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3131659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3131659","startPage":"1924","endPage":"1938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09629334.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-Oriented Application Programming Interface for Digital Audio Workstations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-Oriented Application Programming Interface for Digital Audio Workstations","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9629334/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629334/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPU-Oriented Application Programming Interface for Digital Audio Workstations","sourcePdf":"tpds-ludovico-3131659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121064S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9629334","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9629346,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computing Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9629346/yuan-3131680-small.gif","p":["Liang Yuan received the MS degree from the Faculty of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences, The University of Adelaide, in 2017.

Due to limited physical sizes and constrained storage resources, individual edge servers cannot store a large amount of data when operating independently. They often need to offload data to other edge servers to serve users collaboratively. Operated by different edge infrastructure providers, edge servers usually work in a distrusted environment. Incentive and trust are the two main challenges in facilitating collaborative edge storage. This article proposes CSEdge, a novel decentralized system that tackles these challenges to enable collaborative edge storage based on blockchain. On CSEdge, edge servers can submit data offloading requests for others to contend for. Winners are selected based on their reputations. They will store the offloaded data and receive rewards for successfully finishing data offloading tasks. Via a distributed consensus, their performance will be recorded on blockchain for future reputation evaluation. A prototype of CSEdge is built on Hyperledger Sawtooth and experimentally evaluated against a baseline system and two start-of-the-art systems in a simulated MEC environment. The results demonstrate that CSEdge can effectively and efficiently facilitate collaborative edge storage among edge servers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9629346/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CSEdge: Enabling Collaborative Edge Storage for Multi-Access Edge Computing Based on Blockchain","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP180100212 and DP200102491"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSEdge: Enabling Collaborative Edge Storage for Multi-Access Edge Computing Based on Blockchain","sourcePdf":"tpds-he-3131680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189903S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9629346","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9629407,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh S.

In the adaptive communication system, the wide range of antennas is unable to provide accurate IF carrier. In addition to this, due to the Doppler effect or oscillator mismatch, the desired IF carrier gets changed and unable to convert the passband signal to an error-free baseband signal. In this paper, we have estimated IF carrier using a deep neural network (DNN). In statistical-based IF carrier estimation methods, signal bandwidth must be known prior to the IF carrier estimation, but the proposed scheme does not require knowledge of it. The proposed scheme also does not require any information on modulation schemes, channel state information (CSI), and synchronization parameters. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in the presence of Rayleigh and Rician fading environment for five different modulation classes and compared with a statistical method by normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance metric. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the statistical method at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/I3CAT53310.2021.9629407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I3CAT53310.2021.9629407","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computing and Communications Applications and Technologies (I3CAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629353/9629392/09629407.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computing and Communications Applications and Technologies (I3CAT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Intermediate Frequency Carrier Estimation by Using Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Automated Intermediate Frequency Carrier Estimation by Using Deep Neural Network","conferenceDate":"15-15 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9629407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629407/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Intermediate Frequency Carrier Estimation by Using Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Ipswich, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570734222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078539S","chronDate":"15-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629353","isNumber":"9629392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629353","xplore-issue":"9629392","articleId":"9629407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9629409,"authors":[{"name":"Sashank Sridhar","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sashank","lastName":"Sridhar"},{"name":"Sowmya Sanagavarapu","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sowmya","lastName":"Sanagavarapu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2441-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2442-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9629409","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Solid modeling","Analytical models","Extreme learning machines","Pumps","Companies","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Market Manipulation","Volume and Price Manipulation","Extreme Learning Machines","Feature Importance","Stock Markets","Anomaly Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629409","abstract":"A stock market enables the buying, selling and issuance of the shares of a publicly-held company. With a large number of transactions in the market happening every second, it is hard to accurately and fast detect market abuse. The act of falsely affecting the supply or demand for a security by distorting the security prices or trading volume is referred market manipulation. By using high-performing machine learning techniques, the detection of various market manipulation scenarios is possible through pattern recognition. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine framework, ELMAD, has been implemented to identify market manipulation in the market price and volume data. The dataset with the daily trading data has been extracted from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) based on the affidavit information provided by the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for companies that have been involved in stock market manipulations. The feedforward algorithm focuses on the incorporating continuous constraints into its training on the data to produce one optimal solution with a high speed of learning. The ELM-AD model achieved a high accuracy of 84.02% and 82.70% for price and volume manipulation detection, respectively, with a low false-positive rate and a comparative analysis of the implemented model is presented with state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/I3CAT53310.2021.9629409","startPage":"44","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computing and

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promise in extracting high-degree-of-freedom motor intent from myoelectric signals, thereby providing more intuitive and dexterous prosthetic control. An important next consideration for these algorithms is if performance remains stable over multiple days. Here we introduce a new LSTM network and compare its performance to previously established state-of-the-art algorithms\u2013a CNN and a modified Kalman filter (MKF)\u2013in offline analyses using 76 days of intramuscular recordings from one amputee participant collected over 425 calendar days. Specifically, we assessed the robustness of each algorithm over time by training on data from the first (one, five, ten, 30, or 60) days and then testing on myoelectric signals on the last 16 days. Results indicate that training on additional datasets from prior days generally decreases the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of intended and unintended movements for all algorithms. Across all algorithms trained with 60 days of data, the lowest RMSE for unintended movements was achieved with the LSTM. The LSTM also showed less across-day variance in RMSE of unintended movements relative to the other algorithms. Altogether this work suggests that the LSTM algorithm introduced here can provide more intuitive and dexterous control for prosthetic users, and that training on multiple days of data improves overall performance on subsequent days, at least for offline analyses.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629580","startPage":"6171","endPage":"6174","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09629580.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network Provides Stable Across-Day Prosthetic Control for a Human Amputee with Implanted Intramuscular Electromyographic Recording Leads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Recurrent neural networks","Feature extraction","Biology","Robustness","Convolutional neural networks","Kalman filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network Provides Stable Across-Day Prosthetic Control for a Human Amputee with Implanted Intramuscular Electromyographic Recording Leads","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9629580/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","pubMedId":"34892525","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000179","fundingName":"Office of the Director"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004712","fundingName":"Interface"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recurrent Neural Network Provides Stable Across-Day Prosthetic Control for a Human Amputee with Implanted Intramuscular Electromyographic Recording Leads","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"1078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052255S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9629580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9629597,"authors":[{"name":"Illia Fedorin","affiliation":["Samsung R&D Institute Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Illia","lastName":"Fedorin"},{"name":"Kostyantyn Slyusarenko","affiliation":["Samsung R&D Institute Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Kostyantyn","lastName":"Slyusarenko"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9629597","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pathology","Recurrent neural networks","Biological system modeling","Wearable computers","Sleep apnea","Time measurement","Sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629597","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09629597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","startPage":"849","endPage":"452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consumer Smartwatches As a Portable PSG: LSTM Based Neural Networks for a Sleep-Related Physiological Parameters Estimation","abstract":"Recently, mobile and wearable devices have become an increasingly integral part of our lives. They provide a possibility of detailed health monitoring using noninvasive and user-friendly techniques. However, lack of continuous monitoring, the need of specific sensors, and the limitations in memory and power consumption are only some of the potential drawbacks of such devices. In the current paper a system based on a deep recurrent neural network is developed for an automatic continuous monitoring of sleep-related physiological parameters by means of a wearable biosignal monitoring systems. Smartwatches based algorithm for non-invasive monitoring of sleep stages, respiratory events (including sleep apnea and hypopnea), snore and blood oxygen saturation is developed. Our experimental results demonstrate that proposed model constitutes a noninvasive and inexpensive screening system for sleep-related physiological parameters and pathological states. The model has shown a 77 % accuracy in sleep stages prediction, more than 80 % accuracy in epoch-by-epoch respiratory events classification, above 60 % accuracy in snore events classification and above 70 % accuracy in blood oxygen saturation (SpO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n) level classification (for a two class problem with a SpO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n threshold of 95 %).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629597/","pubMedId":"34891423","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9629597/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Consumer Smartwatches As a Portable PSG: LSTM Based Neural Networks for a Sleep-Related Physiological Parameters Estimation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consumer Smartwatches As a Portable PSG: LSTM Based Neural Networks for a Sleep-Related Physiological Parameters Estimation","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"1527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065353S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9629597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9629607,"authors":[{"name":"Long Bai","affiliation":["Beijing Institute and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Bai"},{"name":"Sihang Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Institute and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sihang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Mingyang Gao","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingyang","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Leila Abdelrahman","affiliation":["University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Abdelrahman"},{"name":"Manal Al Ghamdi","affiliation":["Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Manal Al","lastName":"Ghamdi"},{"name":"Mohamed Abdel-Mottaleb","affiliation":["University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abdel-Mottaleb"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9629607","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629607","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Retinopathy","Retina","Information age","Biology","Diabetes","Biological neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629607","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09629607.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","startPage":"3514","endPage":"3517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of Age and Gender Information on the Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy: Based on Neural Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes the importance of age and gender information in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We utilized Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet), which are proven effective on image classification problems and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using the retinal fundus images. We used the ensemble of several classical networks and decentralized the training so that the network was simple and avoided overfitting. To observe whether the age and gender information could help enhance the performance, we added the information before the dense layer and compared the results with the results that did not add age and gender information. We found that the test accuracy of the network with age and gender information was 2.67% higher than that of the network without age and gender information.

While deep learning approaches have progressed substantially in terms of decoding accuracy, their power consumption is relatively high for mobile applications. Neuromorphic hardware arises as a promising solution to tackle this problem since it can run massive spiking neural networks with energy consumption orders of magnitude lower than traditional hardware. Herein, we show the viability of directly mapping a continuous-valued convolutional neural network for motor imagery EEG classification to a spiking neural network. The converted network, able to run on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic chip, only shows a 1.91% decrease in accuracy after conversion. Thus, we take full advantage of the benefits of both deep learning accuracies and low-power neuro-inspired hardware, properties that are key for the development of wearable BCI devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Neuromorphics","Wearable computers","Electroencephalography","Hardware","Energy efficiency","Brain-computer interfaces"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Deep Learning","Electroencephalography","Neural Networks, Computer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629621","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09629621.pdf","startPage":"6102","endPage":"6105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstrating the Viability of Mapping Deep Learning Based EEG Decoders to Spiking Networks on Low-powered Neuromorphic Chips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demonstrating the Viability of Mapping Deep Learning Based EEG Decoders to Spiking Networks on Low-powered Neuromorphic Chips","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9629621/","isConference":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9629621/","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","pubMedId":"34892509","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Demonstrating the Viability of Mapping Deep Learning Based EEG Decoders to Spiking Networks on Low-powered Neuromorphic Chips","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"0921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08736S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9629621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9629857,"authors":[{"name":"Lam Pham","affiliation":["Competence Unit Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Center for Digital Safety & Security, Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Lam","lastName":"Pham"},{"name":"Huy Phan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Phan"},{"name":"Alexander Schindler","affiliation":["Competence Unit Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Center for Digital Safety & Security, Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Schindler"},{"name":"Ross King","affiliation":["Competence Unit Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, Center for Digital Safety & Security, Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Ross","lastName":"King"},{"name":"Alfred Mertins","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, University of L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Mertins"},{"name":"Ian McLoughlin","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"McLoughlin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9629857","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9629857","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Pulmonary diseases","Biological system modeling","Predictive models","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction","Task analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629857","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09629857.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inception-Based Network and Multi-Spectrogram Ensemble Applied To Predict Respiratory Anomalies and Lung Diseases","abstract":"This paper presents an inception-based deep neural network for detecting lung diseases using respiratory sound input.

Close monitoring is essential for slowing down the progression of AD. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Previous studies usually focused on extracting features from whole image or specific slices separately, but ignore the characteristics of each slice from multiple perspectives and the complementarity between features at different scales. In this study, we proposed a novel classification method based on the fusion of multi-view 2D and 3D convolutions for MRI-based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we first use multiple sub-networks to extract the local slice-level feature of each slice in different dimensions. Then a 3D convolution network was used to extract the global subject-level information of MRI. Finally, local and global information were fused to acquire more discriminative features. Experiments conducted on the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 dataset demonstrated the superiority of this proposed model over other state-of-the-art methods for their ability to discriminate AD and Normal Controls (NC). Our model achieves 90.2% and 85.2% of accuracy on ADNI-2 and ADNI-1 respectively, thus it can be effective in AD diagnosis.
