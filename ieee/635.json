The key design issue of de-magnetization is analytically investigated, pointing out the maximum allowed current loading, depending on temperature and machine dimensions. Such current limit is then compared with the one imposed by the thermal constraint. The analysis shows that low and medium size machines tend to be robust against demagnetization, while larger machines are more at risk. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by finite-elements via an example machine design.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350047","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350047.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350047","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferrite assisted synchronous reluctance machines: A general approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ferrite assisted synchronous reluctance machines: A general approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350047/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350047/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13119353","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferrite assisted synchronous reluctance machines: A general approach","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1315ff002801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076852S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6350058,"authors":[{"name":"M. van der Geest","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["M. van der Geest received a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering at the Delft University of Technology in 2011 and is now a PhD-student working in the field of electrical machine design and optimization."]},"firstName":"M.","lastName":"van der Geest","id":"37945885100"},{"name":"H.

For a fair quantitative comparison the machines considered should be optimized under the given constraints, but optimally designing machines requires a significant amount of expertise and time. The aim of this paper is to present a flexible, numerical (2D) approach to optimize substantially different machines, thereby eliminating the complexities of designing a machine. The loss of insight into the problem caused by this approach is dealt with by using multi-target optimization and presenting the results as pareto optimal fronts. This allows a direct comparison of the machines under consideration and also enables the designer to immediately select a promising design for further analysis. The method is demonstrated on the design of three different PM machines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350058/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119364","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350058/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization and comparison of electrical machines using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and comparison of electrical machines using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1380ff007897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069554S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6350066,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the experiments, the additional loss caused by the inverter carrier is obtained by subtracting the total input of the motor driven by a sinusoidal power supply from that of the motor driven by the inverter. In the calculation, a combined 2-D and 1-D finite element method is applied in order to take into account the skin effect in electrical steel sheets used for the core. Then, the components of the additional motor loss are individually calculated according to their origins. Both the experimental and calculated results show that the total additional loss caused by the inverter decreases with an increase in the switching frequency and that the total additional loss does not depend on load conditions. These tendencies are exactly the same as that described in IEC/TS 60034. On the other hand, the finite element method reveals the variation in each loss component with switching frequency and load conditions. It is concluded that the variation in the additional loss with the switching frequency is mainly attributed to the variation in the core loss. In addition, the ratio of harmonic copper and rotor cage losses increase whereas that of harmonic core loss decreases with load because of an increase in the magnetic saturation at the rotor surface.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350085","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350085.pdf","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Additional harmonic losses of induction motors by PWM inverters: Comparison between result of finite element method and IEC/TS 60034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350085/","displayDocTitle":"Additional harmonic losses of induction motors by PWM inverters: Comparison between result of finite element method and IEC/TS 60034","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13119389","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350085/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Additional harmonic losses of induction motors by PWM inverters: Comparison between result of finite element method and IEC/TS 60034","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1552ff003085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06554S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6350087,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Toma","affiliation":["SPE Laboratory (UMR CNRS 6134), University of Corsica, Corte, France"],"bio":{"p":["Samuel Toma was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1987.

For the first time both stator line current and field current of the synchronous machine have been used independently to diagnose eccentricity. Experiments conducted on a 3 hp salient pole synchronous motor have been used to validate the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350097","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350097.pdf","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Current residue based load independent eccentricity detection in salient pole synchronous machines","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132334","htmlLink":"/document/6350097/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current residue based load independent eccentricity detection in salient pole synchronous machines","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1625ff006475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083781S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6350108,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for fault detection and diagnosis based on Hidden Markov Models. This approach uses pattern recognition combining motor current signature analysis and multiple features extracted from transformations made on current and voltage signals in order to build the representation space. If the representation space is well chosen, each operating mode can be represented as a class. A hidden Markov model is then designed for each class and used as classifier for the detection and diagnosis of faults. The proposed approach is tested on an induction motor of 5.5 Kw with bearing failures and broken rotor bars. Further, the effectiveness of this approach is compared with a neural-network-based approach. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the hidden Markov model-based approach in condition monitoring of electrical machines.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350108","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors based on hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors based on hidden Markov model","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350108/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132345","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6350108/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors based on hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1693ff000612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075371S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6350109,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Understanding the significance and prospects of self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) in distributed wind power generation, this paper presents an exclusive study of fault and a artificial neural network (ANN) based technique for its detection across the stator terminals of the SEIG. Firstly, two-axis model of a 7.5 hp industrial copper-rotor SEIG is developed to perform numerical investigations under static loading conditions, faulty conditions and hence derive data for designing the ANN based detection scheme. Fault tolerant capability of the machine is experimentally elicited by applying a short-circuit fault across the terminals of the machine and the need for fault detection in the SEIG system is discussed. Lastly, a novel ANN based scheme is developed for fault detection and numerical investigations are performed to illustrate the performance of the developed scheme. This paper aims to provide a good study to understand and develop a ANN based device for fault detection in a SEIG system.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350109","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1705","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350109.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection in copper-rotor SEIG system using artificial neural network for distributed wind power generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350109/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault detection in copper-rotor SEIG system using artificial neural network for distributed wind power generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350109/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13132346","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection in copper-rotor SEIG system using artificial neural network for distributed wind power generation","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1700ff010367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060142S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6350130,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This is the reason why there is continuous research on techniques for prompt detection. In this work a study of the influences of the broken bar fault to the electromagnetic characteristics of the induction motor is presented, using an asynchronous cage motor and FEM analysis. To this direction two models have been created and studied: a healthy one and a model with a broken bar fault. Additionally, a new approach on the detection of the broken rotor bar fault through the electromagnetic torque monitoring is suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13132373","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6350136/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"The influence of the broken bar fault on the magnetic field and electromagnetic torque in 3-phase induction motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of the broken bar fault on the magnetic field and electromagnetic torque in 3-phase induction motors","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"1868ff001236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068238S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6350228,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Thus, a reliable bearing condition monitoring scheme able to detect either local or distributed defects are mandatory to avoid a breakdown in the machine. So far, the research has been carried out mainly in the detection of local faults, such as balls and raceways faults, but surface roughness is not so reported. This paper deals with a novel and reliable scheme capable to detect any fault that may occur in a bearing, based on EXIN Curvilinear Component Analysis, CCA, and Neural Network. The EXIN CCA, which is an improvement of the Curvilinear Component Analysis, has been conceived for data visualization, interpretation and classification for real time industrial applications. The effectiveness of this condition monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from different operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350231","startPage":"2472","endPage":"2478","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350231.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel condition monitoring scheme for bearing faults based on Curvilinear Component Analysis and hierarchical neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Employee welfare","Circuit faults","Training","Neural networks","Vibrations","Torque","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","electric machine analysis computing","extrapolation","fault diagnosis","interpolation","least squares approximations","machine bearings","matrix algebra","neural nets","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bearing faults","hierarchical neural networks","electrical machines","reliable bearing condition monitoring scheme","local fault detection","raceways faults","surface roughness","EXIN curvilinear component analysis","EXIN CCA","data visualization","data interpretation","data classification","real time industrial applications","least squares technique","data matrix","recall-interpolation phase","extrapolation analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball bearings","Classification algorithms","Curvilinear Component Analysis","Discriminant Analysis","Fault diagnosis","Least Squares approximation","Motor Fault detection","Neural Networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Radial basis function networks","Time domain analysis","Vibrations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel condition monitoring scheme for bearing faults based on Curvilinear Component Analysis and hierarchical neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132458","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel condition monitoring scheme for bearing faults based on Curvilinear Component Analysis and hierarchical neural networks","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"2472ff003735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086141S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6350234,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Gardel","affiliation":["University of Valladolid, Spain","National University of Asuncion, Paraguay"],"bio":{"p":["Pedro Esteban Gardel Sotomayor received the B.S. degree in Electromechanical Engineering from the National University of Asuncion (UNA), Paraguay, in 2006.

Smart sensors are an approach to increase performance and overcome costs in monitoring systems. This work presents preliminary results on the implementation of a smart sensor for electrical machine monitoring integrated as a low-cost SoC. The proposed smart sensor is based on a reconfigurable hardware architecture implemented into a field programmable gate array. It extracts statistics like mean, variance, information entropy, and the distribution histogram from the acquired signal. It can work as a standalone system, showing obtained results on a VGA screen or LCD, or streaming out obtained results for further processing. Two study cases demonstrate its effectiveness during electrical machine monitoring: Detection of time-dependent harmonic effects on the voltage signal provided by a VSD. Identification of broken bars and unbalance in induction motors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13132463","htmlLink":"/document/6350236/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Smart sensor for electrical machine monitoring through statistical analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart sensor for electrical machine monitoring through statistical analysis","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"2505ff002593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084056S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6350244,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The work is undertaken as a part of the EU funded P-MOB (Personal Mobility) project. By analysing the energy distribution of a given driving cycle, the energy efficiency of the traction machine over the driving cycle can be characterized against a number of representative points and the design optimization can be carried out with respect to these points. This dramatically reduces the computation time of the design optimization process, while improving the energy efficiency of the traction machines. The utility of the design technique has been illustrated through design case studies and its effectiveness validated by experimental results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Vehicles","Energy consumption","Traction motors","Iron","Energy efficiency","Energy loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","energy conservation","traction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally efficient design technique","electric vehicle traction machines","EV traction machines","torque-speed operating range","volumetric design constraints","thermal design constraints","EU funded P-MOB","personal mobility project","energy distribution","traction machine","driving cycle","design optimization process","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric vehicles","permanent magnet machines","traction drive","design optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350251","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350251.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computationally efficient design technique for electric vehicle traction machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient design technique for electric vehicle traction machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350251/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350251/","accessionNumber":"13132475","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient design technique for electric vehicle traction machines","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"2596ff003778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076649S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6350272,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The approach is based on the inclusion of the magnetic saturation into the analytical model by a fictive permeance variation. Besides that, it supposes that, in air-gap nonuniformity conditions, the well-known saturation factor must be updated in function of the spatial-dependant air-gap length. The 2D-modified winding function approach (2D-MWFA) is utilized to get the inductance formalism while assuming a linear rise of the saturation factor with respect to the air-gap length in a particular circumferential region. We show that the proposed model yields more reasonable results by confirming that the magnetic saturation effect reduces the asymmetry of the air-gap flux distribution due to the eccentricity. Furthermore, we highlight this effect by inspecting the shapes of the calculated inductances and making them ready for a full dynamic simulation in sense of multiple coupled circuit model (MCCM).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A winding function-based model of air-gap eccentricity in saturated induction motors","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350274","startPage":"2739","endPage":"2745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06350274.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A winding function-based model of air-gap eccentricity in saturated induction motors","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350274/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132497","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A winding function-based model of air-gap eccentricity in saturated induction motors","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"2739ff006661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078952S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6350274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6350288,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When GPS signal propagate through the Earth's atmosphere, it will be bent and delayed due to the gradient atmosphere refractive index and received by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite. Then the parameter profiles of atmosphere can be retrieved by using the received signal. In the previous research, in order to simplify the simulation, the Earth's atmosphere is assumed as spherical symmetry and the positions of GPS and LEO satellites are not considered in simulations. In the model, the shape of the Earth is assumed as an ellipse. The information of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used to construct the refractive index of Earth's atmosphere. And two aiming algorithm are developed to control the initial propagating direction of GPS signal to begin from the prescribed GPS satellite position and end at the LEO satellite position. The model is tested and verified by comparing with analytical and observational data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing

high-resolution aerial images has attracted particular attention in recent years. However, scene complexity, large illumination change and occlusions make the task very challenging. In this paper, we propose a robust and effective framework for car detection from high-resolution aerial imagery. More specifically, we first incorporate multiple diverse and complementary image descriptors, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Opponent Histogram. Subsequently taking computational efficiency and runtime complexity into account, we adopt an interactive bootstrapping approach to collect hard negatives for training an intersection kernel support vector machine (IKSVM). After training, detection is performed by exhaustive search. Finally for post-processing, we employ a greedy procedure for eliminating repetitive detections via non-maximum suppression. Furthermore, contextual information is utilized to refine the detections. Experimental results on Vaihingen dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various real scenes.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350403","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","startPage":"4379","endPage":"4382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Car detection from high-resolution aerial imagery using multiple features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Car detection from high-resolution aerial imagery using multiple features","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350403/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134222","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6350403/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Car detection from high-resolution aerial imagery using multiple features","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0004379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045305S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6350456,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Qin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Qin","id":"38252650700"},{"name":"Wang Zhan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhan","id":"38251989000"},{"name":"Jiang ZhiHong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"ZhiHong","id":"37398099100"},{"name":"HuangFu Kan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"HuangFu","lastName":"Kan","id":"37286741100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6350456","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Azimuth","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","CW radar","FM radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FMCW SAR system performance","classic Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave Synthetic Aperture Radar","digital beamforming technology","pulsed SAR","approximation error","multiple receive apertures","low pulse repetition frequency","PRF","reference system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency modulation continuous radar","synthetic aperture radar","digital beamforming"]}],"abstract":"According to the limitations of classic Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), digital beamforming technology is introduced to improve system performance.

Although VCA is fast method, many hyperspectral imagery applications require a response in real time or near-real time. This paper proposes two different optimizations for accelerating the computational performance of VCA: the first one focus a parallel implementation based on graphics computing units (GPUs) to alleviate the VCA computational burden; The second one is focused on the development of a strategy to remove a large proportion of mixed pixels that play no effect on the VCA functioning. Experiments are conducted using simulated and real hyperspectral datasets. These results reveal considerable acceleration factors, which satisfies the real-time constraints given by the data acquisition rate.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350513","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350513.pdf","startPage":"4078","endPage":"4081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementation of vertex component analysis for hyperspectral endmember extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementation of vertex component analysis for hyperspectral endmember extraction","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6350513/","accessionNumber":"13145606","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementation of vertex component analysis for hyperspectral endmember extraction","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0004078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056287S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6350532,"authors":[{"name":"Yanqing Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanqing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38500933200"},{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293022500"},{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595461900"},{"name":"Pengbo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"38496491900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6350532","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350532","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","MIMO","Channel capacity","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar antennas","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO SAR model","MIMO communication theory","information theory","MIMO radar system","antenna number","channel character","radar system parameter","pulse repetition frequency","phase array SAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO SAR","channel capacity"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of channel capacity for MIMO SAR model","startPage":"4003","endPage":"4005","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350532","abstract":"MIMO radar can be considered as a particular communication system, which enjoys similar profits to the MIMO communication theory. Based on the information theory, the concept of channel capacity was introduced into the MIMO radar system. In this paper, the capacity expressions for MIMO SAR system were derived. As is shown in the simulation results, the channel capacity of the MIMO SAR depends on the number of the antennas, channel character and radar system parameters. The capacity of MIMO SAR increases with pulse repetition frequency and decreases with range and velocity. Furthermore, the larger the antenna number is, the more information can be obtained from the echoes. Meanwhile, the MIMO SAR capacity is larger than phase array SAR in high SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6350532/","accessionNumber":"13134131","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of channel capacity for MIMO SAR model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of channel capacity for MIMO SAR model","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0004003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030592S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6350536,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Jun Wei","affiliation":["E.E.

In each iterative of the approach, the SAR observation model is updated with the sensor platform positions obtained by a MMSE-based focusing cost function, after that, the image is reconstructed by LS regularization technique with the updated observation model.

The stress enhancement and energy accumulation in seismic activity area change locally the physical parameters of lithosphere with the developing of a series of effects that can comprise most of the following ones: initial cracks, the fracturing of rockmass, the changing of electromagnetic properties, the decreasing of dielectric constant, the re-activation of P-holes, the leaking of pore-gas, and the rise of water-level. The physical states of coversphere and atmosphere are to be affected due to the lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere (LCA) coupling, and the signals from the underground, surface, and atmosphere to satellites are to be changed with parameter anomaly. We suggested that the LCA coupling is important for understanding GEOSS observations, especially for earthquake anomaly recognition (EAR). Using deviation-time-space-thermal (DTS-T) method for EAR, three recent major earthquakes (2009 Italy L'Aquila earthquake, 2010 China Yushu earthquake and 2010-2011 New Zealand earthquake sequence) are taken as typical cases for analysis to the multi-parameters anomalies, preceding the shocking, with quasi-synchronism and geo-consistency. The specific LCA coupling effects related with the earthquakes are also discussed in brief.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Importance of lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere coupling to earthquake anomaly recognition","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350657","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350657.pdf","startPage":"3532","endPage":"3535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Importance of lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere coupling to earthquake anomaly recognition","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350657/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145688","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance of lithosphere-coversphere-atmosphere coupling to earthquake anomaly recognition","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0003532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06964S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6350674,"authors":[{"name":"Yuntao Qian","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence, College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Qian","id":"37276182300"},{"name":"Minchao Ye","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Minchao","lastName":"Ye","id":"37893591100"},{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence, College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597006100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6350674","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"abstract":"Noise reduction is always an active research area in image processing due to its importance for the sequential tasks such as object classification and detection. In this paper, we develop a sparse representation based noise reduction method for hyperspectral imagery, which is dependent on the assumption that the non-noise component in the signal can be approximated by only a small number of atoms in a dictionary while noise component has not this property. The main contribution of the paper is in introducing nonlocal similarity and spectral-spatial structure of hyperspectral imagery into sparse representation. Non-locality means the self-similarity of image, by which the whole image can be partitioned into some groups containing similar patches. The similar patches in each group is sparsely represented with shared atoms making the signal and noise more easily separated. Sparse representation with spectral-spatial structure can exploit spectral and spatial joint correlations of hyperspectral imagery also making the signal and noise more distinguished, in which 3-D blocks are instead of 2-D patches for sparse coding. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has a good quality of restoring the true signal from the noisy observation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350674.pdf","startPage":"3467","endPage":"3470","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery using nonlocal sparse representation with spectral-spatial structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","geophysical image processing","image classification","image coding","image denoising","image representation","image restoration","image sensors","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image processing","nonlocal sparse representation","spectral-spatial structure","object classification","object detection","image sequential task","noise reduction method","nonnoise component signal approximation","dictionary","signal separation","noise separation","spectral correlation","spatial correlation","sparse coding","2D patch","3D block","signal restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery","noise reduction","sparse representation","nonlocal similarity","spectral-spatial structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery using nonlocal sparse representation with spectral-spatial structure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134178","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise reduction of hyperspectral imagery using nonlocal sparse representation with spectral-spatial structure","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0003467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058122S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6350680,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed method uses previous work for real-time GPU-based geocorrection of airborne pushbroom imagery. By projecting each acquired line onto a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the position and attitude of the camera at the time of acquisition, an orthoimage is generated. Using geocorrection as optimization function, the speed achieved allows using evolutionary methods in feasible time, enabling hundreds of repeated approximations during rectification, in contrast to classical geocorrection methods. In our approach, taking advantage of the speed and parallelization of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) by means of CUDA, PSO is used to find the best match between the projected pixels and a number of Ground Control Points, compensating any systematic errors in the navigation data used for the generation of the orthoimage.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350729","startPage":"4086","endPage":"4089","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing

Hence, the algorithm does not require a previous subspace identification step to estimate the number of endmembers as it can cope with the two most likely scenarios in practice (i.e., the number of endmembers is correctly determined or overestimated a priori). The proposed approach, termed collaborative NMF (CoNMF), uses a collaborative regularization prior which forces the abundances corresponding to the overestimated endmembers to zero, such that it is guaranteed that only the true endmembers have fractional abundance contributions and the estimation of the number of endmembers is not required in advance. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits very good performance in case the number of endmember is not available a priori.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization for remotely sensed hyperspectral unmixing","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350775","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06350775.pdf","startPage":"3078","endPage":"3081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6350775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6350775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization for remotely sensed hyperspectral unmixing","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6350775/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145411","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization for remotely sensed hyperspectral unmixing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0003078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05447S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6350775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6350795,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed approach elaborates the information on the coseismic deformation pattern stemming from available differential interferograms. The interferogram is the expression of the active fault at depth, thus its shape, size and its features somehow refer to the geometry and slip of the fault generating the seism.

In this paper, a new visual attention model based on dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) used for ship detection is proposed. It is a bottom-up visual attention model driven by data rather than by task. First, the input image is converted from RGB color space to HIS color space. Second, the modulus of DWT is analyzed to obtain the conspicuity map of each feature. Third, the conspicuity maps are combined into the saliency map nonlinearly, different from Itti's method, the contribution rate of each conspicuity map to final saliency map is not equal. It is relevant to the difference between the level of the most active region and the average level of the other active regions in each conspicuity map. Finally, the detection result of ships based on saliency map is got by region growing method, where the seed is obtained from the saliency map and the growing process is implemented in intensity image. Experiments on natural ship images show that our method is robust and efficient compared with Itti's and Hou's method.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351063","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351063.pdf","startPage":"2202","endPage":"2205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A visual attention model based on wavelet transform and its application on ship detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351063/","displayDocTitle":"A visual attention model based on wavelet transform and its application on ship detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134107","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351063/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visual attention model based on wavelet transform and its application on ship detection","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0002202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063613S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6351076,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Rich\u00e9","affiliation":["SAPHIR team, UMR CNRS-6164, IETR, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Rich\u00e9","id":"38233125300"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane M\u00e9ric","affiliation":["SAPHIR team, UMR CNRS-6164, IETR, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"M\u00e9ric","id":"37593471100"},{"name":"Eric Pottier","affiliation":["SAPHIR team, UMR CNRS-6164, IETR, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Pottier","id":"37269670300"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Baudais","affiliation":["IETR UMR 6164, National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Baudais","id":"37269847800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351076","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synthetic aperture radar","Chirp","Radar imaging","Azimuth","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","OFDM modulation","radar imaging","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal design","range ambiguity suppression","SAR configuration","synthetic aperture radar system","remote sensing application","specific signal processing","radar image resolution","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing pulse","OFDM signal outperform conventional chirp signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Range ambiguity","OFDM","SAR"]}],"abstract":"Remote sensing applications need specific signal processing to obtain high resolution for radar images. One of limitations for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems is the range ambiguity phenomenon that appears with long delayed echoes. The reflected signal corresponding to the pulse (n) is detected when the radar has already transmitted the next pulse (n + 1). Thus, this signal is considered as an echo from the pulse (n + 1).

A hardware configuration of the radar as well as advanced concepts to be experimentally verified using it are considered and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Beam-Forming reconfigurable Radar System demonstrator","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351103","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351103.pdf","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Digital Beam-Forming reconfigurable Radar System demonstrator","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351103/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145219","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Beam-Forming reconfigurable Radar System demonstrator","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0468S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351157,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Fu Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Space science, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Fu","lastName":"Chao","id":"38509149100"},{"name":"Kun-Shan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Space science, Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Shan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278249700"},{"name":"Jong-Sen Lee","affiliation":["Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, National Central University, Taiwan","Remote Sensing Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Jong-Sen","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280313000"},{"name":"Chih-Tien Wang","affiliation":["Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Tien","lastName":"Wang","id":"37559036200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351157","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering algorithms","Phase noise","Information filters","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","geophysical image processing","information retrieval","phase noise","radar imaging","radar interferometry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interferometric phase","INSAR data","surface height measurement","phase interferograms","phase noise","phase noise minimization","surface information retrieval","refined filter","Lee adaptive INSAR filter","sigma filter","local noise level","phase error minimization","real interferometer data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["refined filter","INSAR filter","phase noise filtering","interferometry"]}],"abstract":"Radar interferometry has been widely applied in measuring the surface height. The information about surface can be derived from phase interferograms. However, phase noise reduces the accuracy and reliability of that information. Hence, the minimization of phase noise is essential to the retrieval of surface information. This work presents a refined filter that is based on the Lee adaptive INSAR filter and the sigma filter. The basic idea is to filter adaptively the interferometric phase according to the local noise level to minimize the loss of signal for a particular shape of fringes, including in such extreme cases as involve broken fringes, following the elimination of unreliable pixels of phase noise. The goal is to reduce the phase deviation and the number of residues, and minimize the phase error. The proposed filter was inspected herein using both simulated data and real interferometer data. Results reveal that the filtering performance is better than that of commonly used filters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refined filtering of interferometric phase from INSAR data","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351157","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351157.pdf","startPage":"1821","endPage":"1824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Refined filtering of interferometric phase from INSAR data","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351157/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145259","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refined filtering of interferometric phase from INSAR data","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046512S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351175,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This optimization process is more efficient as it considers both the angle criterion and distance condition to incorporate multi-objective switching in the fitness function. This optimization process helps in matching three corresponding corner points detected in the reference and sensed image and thereby using the affine transformation, the sensed image is aligned with the reference image. From the results obtained, the performance of the image registration is evaluated and it is concluded that the proposed approach is efficient.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351175","startPage":"1761","endPage":"1764","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351175.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for efficient point matching in multi-sensor satellite image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Image registration","Optimization","Genetics","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine transforms","genetic algorithms","geophysical image processing","image matching","image registration","remote sensing","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithm","point matching","multisensor satellite image","feature points","multiobjective optimization","angle criterion","distance condition","optimization process","multiobjective switching","fitness function","sensed image","affine transformation","reference image","image registration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-sensor image registration","Multi-objective optimization","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for efficient point matching in multi-sensor satellite image","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351175/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for efficient point matching in multi-sensor satellite image","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071404S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351187,"authors":[{"name":"Paris W.

These advanced architectures have been dubbed multiple-input multiple-output SAR (MIMO-SAR) in analogy to MIMO communication systems. Considerable confusion arose, however, with regard to the selection of suitable waveforms for the simultaneous transmission via multiple antennas. In this paper, it is shown that the mere use of orthogonal waveforms is insufficient for the desired performance improvement in view of most SAR applications. As a solution to this fundamental MIMO-SAR problem we had previously suggested to exploit the special data acquisition geometry of a side-looking imaging radar equipped with multiple receiver channels in addition to appropriately designed waveforms transmitted by multiple antennas. Here, we extend this approach to a more general set of radar waveforms with special correlation properties that satisfy a short-term shift-orthogonality condition. We show that the echoes from simultaneously transmitted pulses can be separated if the short-term shift orthogonality is combined with digital beamforming on receive in elevation. This enables the implementation of a fully functional MIMO-SAR without correlation noise leakage for extended scattering scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351242","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-SAR and the orthogonality confusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-SAR and the orthogonality confusion","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134018","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6351242/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-SAR and the orthogonality confusion","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087142S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6351243,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Suess","affiliation":["European Space Agency, ESTEC, 2200AG Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Suess","id":"37266557600"},{"name":"Michael Ludwig","affiliation":["ESTEC, European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ludwig","id":"37269749200"},{"name":"Christoph Schaefer","affiliation":["Astrium GmbH Satellites, Friedrichshafen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Schaefer","id":"37433643900"},{"name":"Marwan Younis","affiliation":["Microwaves and Radar Institute, German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Marwan","lastName":"Younis","id":"37265481900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351243","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Instruments","Spaceborne radar","Array signal processing","Radar imaging","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","geophysical image processing","optimisation","radar antennas","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spaceborne SAR instrument","digital beamforming","optimization","ESA","antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR","digital beamforming","HWRS","instrument technologies","Sentinel-1"]}],"abstract":"During the past ten years a number of research groups around the world have been investigating the use of digital beamforming for spaceborne SAR instruments. The separate optimization of the effective transmit and receive aperture sizes together with the splitting of the receive side into multiple receive sub-apertures which can be combined on board by means of digital beamforming allows for a number of new SAR modes. With this it is for example possible to overcome the principle swath width and azimuth resolution limitation known in classical SAR instrument designs. ESA has performed and initiated a number of systems studies to identify the critical technologies needed for this type of instrument.

In other words, our proposed approach intends to exploit the fact that the high dimensional hyperspectral data lives in a subspace of much lower dimension due to the mixing phenomenon.

In this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) nonlocal means filter is proposed for noise reduction of HSI. Recently, non-local means method attracts many attentions due to its global and local integrated property. Nonlocal algorithm searches the similar image patches in the whole scene to build the mean filter, so that it overcomes the disadvantage of local filter that only local pixels within a small neighbor is used, and the disadvantage of global filter that local structure is ignored. In order to explore the spectral-spatial correlation of HSI, nonlocal means method is extended from 2-D to 3-D. Furthermore, as HSI contains both of signal-independent and signal-dependent noises, variance-stabilizing transformation based on noise estimation is used to make noise reduction under the additive Gaussian noise model. Experiments with the real hyperspectral data set indicate that the proposed strategy can work well in both of detail preservation and noise removal.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351287","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351287.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D nonlocal means filter with noise estimation for hyperspectral imagery denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351287/","displayDocTitle":"3-D nonlocal means filter with noise estimation for hyperspectral imagery denoising","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134047","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351287/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D nonlocal means filter with noise estimation for hyperspectral imagery denoising","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046541S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351314,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The causes are generally attributed to the increase in infrared thermal (IR) temperature and the air ionization produced by increased emanation of radon from the Earth's crust. In this paper, the theoretical analysis and case study show that there is close relationship between soil moisture and SLHF anomalies. For inland earthquakes, the increase of soil moisture due to the rising of groundwater level will bring with higher potential evaporation, leading to the increase of latent heat flux. Further study with more accurate soil moisture product after the new satellite mission will help us to better understand the influence of soil moisture on SLHF variation and their relations with seismogenic process.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351333","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351333.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanisms and relationship to soil moisture of surface latent heat flux anomaly before Inland earthquakes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351333/","displayDocTitle":"Mechanisms and relationship to soil moisture of surface latent heat flux anomaly before Inland earthquakes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145352","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351333/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanisms and relationship to soil moisture of surface latent heat flux anomaly before Inland earthquakes","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065124S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351334,"authors":[{"name":"Shanjun Liu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Shanjun","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yuntao Ma","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Lixin Wu","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Wu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351334","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earthquakes","Microwave theory and techniques","Brightness temperature","Strips","Microwave radiometry","Remote sensing","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthquakes","microwaves","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave radiation anomaly","Yushu earthquake","China","AD 2010 04 14","epicenter","AMER-E satellite remote sensing data","microwave brightness temperature","microwave anomaly"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["earthquake","microwave radiation anomaly","remote sensing","AMER-E"]}],"abstract":"A violent earthquake (Ms 7.1) occurred in Yushu county of China on April 14, 2010, and the epicenter was (33.1\u00b0N, 96.7\u00b0E). It caused 2689 people death. We use the AMER-E satellite remote sensing data to analyze the variation of microwave radiation around the epicenter. It was found 45 days before the earthquake a high microwave radiation strip appeared in the southwest of the epicenter, and gradually became longer and wider. The largest increment of microwave brightness temperature was up to 12K. 9 days before earthquake another high microwave radiation strip appeared in the northwest of the epicenter and the epicenter was just in the intersection of the two the high microwave radiation strips. 4 days before the earthquake the strength of the microwave anomaly became weak, but one day before the earthquake the strength became increase again. After the main shock the anomaly still existed for about 20days and was finally disappeared. To explore the cause of microwave radiation anomaly the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) and the air temperature variation was investigated. The final result indicated the microwave anomaly was caused by the temperature increase, i.e. the anomaly should belong to thermal anomaly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Yushu earthquake and its mechanism","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351334","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351334.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Yushu earthquake and its mechanism","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351334/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145353","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave radiation anomaly of Yushu earthquake and its mechanism","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0001192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042187S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6351383,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Barilone","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universita di Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Barilone","id":"38509462500"},{"name":"Alessandra Budillon","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universita di Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Budillon","id":"37283845200"},{"name":"Gilda Schirinzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento per le Tecnologie, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Universita di Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Gilda","lastName":"Schirinzi","id":"37284811000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351383","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Tomography","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Vectors","Reflectivity","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image reconstruction","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling","SAR tomography","three-dimensional reconstruction","reflectivity profile","image acquisition","SAR platform","Fourier-type techniques","tomographic technique","compressive sampling tomography","COSMO-Skymed real data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography","Compressive Sampling","Super-resolution imaging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351383","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351383.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sampling in SAR tomography: Results on COSMO-Skymed data","abstract":"SAR tomography allows the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the reflectivity profile of the observed scene on the ground.

The spatial resolution in the elevation direction obtained with conventional Fourier-type techniques is related to the overall baseline extent of the acquisition orbits. Recently a tomographic technique denoted as Compressive Sampling Tomography (CST) has been introduced. It allows a drastic reduction of the number of acquisitions required and attains an increased resolution in the elevation direction. It exploits the sparsity property of the reflectivity profile in the elevation direction.

This means that the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is satisfied [1]. However this theorem does not take into account the properties of the signal to be transmitted. Some recent works have used prior knowledge of the signal properties such as its sparsity. This new theory has recently been extensively used in the literature since it offers nice mathematical results for acquiring and reconstructing a sparse or compressible signal. This method has already been used in remote sensing, especially in the Herschel mission, which is a satellite dedicated to observation of the universe. In this work, we propose to analyse the applicability of compressed sensing in the framework of earth observation with high resolution satellite imagery, considering simultaneously the impact on the image quality performances, the on-board capacities and the adaptability to on-board hard physical constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351550.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing for earth observation with high resolution satellite imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Satellites","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Image coding","Noise measurement","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image restoration","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Earth observation","high resolution satellite imagery","image acquisition chains","Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem","sparse signal","compressible signal","remote sensing","Herschel mission","high resolution satellite imagery","image quality performances","on-board hard physical constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing for earth observation with high resolution satellite imagery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351550/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145139","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing for earth observation with high resolution satellite imagery","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0000412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049144S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351593,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Beijing, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Gao","id":"38570928200"},{"name":"Weidong Yu","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37292363200"},{"name":"Robert Wang","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406140100"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Jia","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Jia","id":"38570763400"},{"name":"Yunhua Luo","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Beijing, China","Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yunhua","lastName":"Luo","id":"38502118300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Antennas","Image coding","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","motion error extraction","Motion Compensation","pseudo-inverse method"]}],"abstract":"The quality of Synthetic Aperture Radar image is affected by the deviation of radar platforms from the nominal straight line which is usually measured based on hardware such as Inertial Measurement Unit and Global Position System with high accuracy.

To demonstrate the advantages of the coil structure with the ferrimagnetic material and metallic shielding, magnetic field distributions and the electrical performance of three different coil structures are investigated via 3D electromagnetic (EM) field solver and SPICE simulation. Results show that the suggested method considerably reduces the leakage magnetic field in the vicinity of the WPT system without significant loss of electrical performance. The simulation results of the suggested coil structure are experimentally verified with a 100 W-class WPT system for an LED TV.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13116394","htmlLink":"/document/6351659/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of leakage magnetic field from a wireless power transfer system using ferrimagnetic material and metallic shielding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of leakage magnetic field from a wireless power transfer system using ferrimagnetic material and metallic shielding","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"1171626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06389S","chronDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333908","isNumber":"6350913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333908","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6350913","articleId":"6351659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6351674,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Kobayashi","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryota","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"38500612800"},{"name":"Genki Kubo","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Genki","lastName":"Kubo","id":"38496325700"},{"name":"Hiroki Otsuka","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"38510955800"},{"name":"Tatsuya Mido","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Mido","id":"38501048400"},{"name":"Yoshinori Kobayashi","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"38503773700"},{"name":"Hideyuki Fujii","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Fujii","id":"38238781800"},{"name":"Toshio Sudo","affiliation":["Shibaura Institute of Technology and Science, Kyoto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Sudo","id":"38551667600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2060-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2061-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2059-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1118"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-110X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-110X"}],"articleNumber":"6351674","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351674","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Impedance","System-on-a-chip","Capacitance","Power supplies","Resistance","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electromagnetic interference","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit packaging","large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critically damped total PDN impedance","chip-package-board codesign","CMOS LSI","clock frequency","power integrity","digital electronic systems","power supply fluctuation","core circuits","I/O circuits","logic instability","electromagnetic radiation","power distribution network","on-chip capacitance","package inductance","signal integrity","electromagnetic interference","EMI","critical damping condition","power supply noise","test chips"]}],"abstract":"As CMOS LSIs operate at higher clock frequency and at lower supply voltage, power integrity is becoming a critical issue to maintain digital electronic systems more stable. Power supply fluctuation excited by core circuits or I/O circuits induces logic instability and electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, total impedance of power distribution network (PDN) must be taking into consideration in the chip-package-board co-design. Especially, anti-resonance peaks in the PDN due to the parallel combination of on-chip capacitance and package inductance induces the unwanted power supply fluctuation, and results in the degradation of signal integrity and electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this paper, effects of critical damping condition for the total PDN impedance on power supply noise has been studied by designing different on-chip PDN properties. The measured power supply noises for the four test chips successfully showed typical characteristics of 3 different regions. The critical damping condition against the anti-resonance peak has been proved to be effective to suppress the power supply noise on a chip.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351674","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333908/6350913/06351674.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of critically damped total PDN impedance in chip-package-board co-design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of critically damped total PDN impedance in chip-package-board co-design","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6351674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116408","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351674/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of critically damped total PDN impedance in chip-package-board co-design","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"0981445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045658S","chronDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333908","isNumber":"6350913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333908","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6350913","articleId":"6351674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6351681,"authors":[{"name":"Penghui Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Penghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539458900"},{"name":"Xiaojian Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37276823200"},{"name":"Qingsheng Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Qingsheng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37082660100"},{"name":"Mustapha C.

Three types of feature representation and two learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Backpropagation Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP)) were used yielding six classification methods to perform the combination. Our combination proposal is based on Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), in which weights are found using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) - WLC-GA.

It is thought that such a device will be useful for measurements involving differential data busses such as the CAN bus. A numerical model is developed using the full dispersion characteristics of the ferrite core. The model is verified with measurements and good agreement is obtained between numerical simulations and experimentally measured data. As with conventional BCI probes, the ability of the ferrite core to facilitate the inductive coupling is retained even in the dispersive frequency region of ferrite. The probe geometry is such that a number of such devices can be arrayed to provide a region of uniform magnetic field illumination of a transmission line.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Power transmission lines","Magnetic cores","Transmission line measurements","Conductors","Ferrites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controller area networks","cores","ferrites","numerical analysis","power transformers","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamping transformer","balanced transmission lines","balanced mode excitation","differential mode","probe window","BCI probe","common-mode injection","common-mode sensing","differential data busses","CAN bus","ferrite core","numerical simulations","inductive coupling","uniform magnetic field illumination","bulk current injection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351751","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333908/6350913/06351751.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Excitation of balanced modes in transmission lines using a clamping transformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Excitation of balanced modes in transmission lines using a clamping transformer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351751/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351751/","accessionNumber":"13116431","conferenceDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Excitation of balanced modes in transmission lines using a clamping transformer","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"0101442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045901S","chronDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333908","isNumber":"6350913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333908","xplore-issue":"6350913","articleId":"6351751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6351755,"authors":[{"name":"Dazhao Liu","affiliation":["EMC Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Dazhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065607900"},{"name":"Siming Pan","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Siming","lastName":"Pan","id":"37847170200"},{"name":"Brice Achkir","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brice","lastName":"Achkir","id":"37317585800"},{"name":"Jun Fan","affiliation":["EMC Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fan","id":"37271216200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2060-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2061-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2059-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1118"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-110X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-110X"}],"articleNumber":"6351755","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351755","abstract":"A fast method to calculate the admittance matrix of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) is proposed in this paper.

One of the important issues in the simulation of antenna array is the coupling consideration between the antenna elements. The full wave simulation can take the coupling of the antenna elements into account; however, it is either beyond the ability of computer resources or not reasonable simulation time. We introduce an effective simulation method to consider the coupling effect through the multiple simulations of a small local region. The parallel FDTD method has been successfully applied to solve the various EMC and other electromagnetic phenomena. There are two important issues in the simulation of large phase antenna array using parallel FDTD method: (1) each phase distribution requires an independent simulation that losses the wideband feature of FDTD method; and (2) for a very large antenna array, the parallel FDTD algorithm running on a powerful computer cluster cannot solve the most practical phased array problems today. Here, we use the concept of characteristic basis function of an antenna array to efficiently simulate one large antenna array. In this method, we only need to simulate a small array as a basis function with different excitation patterns. The solution to the original array can be obtained by summarizing the basis function weighted by the element factor.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333908/6350913/06351802.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2012.6351802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective simulation technique for large phased arrays using parallel FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Helical antennas","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic compatibility","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective simulation technique","large phased arrays","parallel FDTD method","large antenna array","antenna array simulation","computer resources","EMC","electromagnetic phenomena","phase distribution","excitation patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD","parallel","phased antenna array","characteristic basis function","surface current","directivity pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An effective simulation technique for large phased arrays using parallel FDTD method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116476","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective simulation technique for large phased arrays using parallel FDTD method","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"0201474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056209S","chronDate":"6-10 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333908","isNumber":"6350913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333908","xplore-issue":"6350913","articleId":"6351802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351817,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Hua Wang","affiliation":["Centre for Optical and EM Research (COER), State Key Laboratory of MOI, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China","Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900807800"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Centre for Optical and EM Research (COER), State Key Laboratory of MOI, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China","Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Design and EMC of High-Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37278303000"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Design and EMC of High-Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37634929500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2060-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2061-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2059-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1118"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-110X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-110X"}],"articleNumber":"6351817","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"An improved leapfrog alternating-direction (ADI) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is provided for computing surface current distributions of some complex PEC and dielectric composite structures illuminated by an intentional electromagnetic pulse (IEMP).

weather conditions. Thanks to these characteristics, during the past decade, its use in the field of maritime security and safety has increased. Nowadays one of the SAR-based applications to increase the maritime security is ship detection. Automatic SAR ship detection is not a trivial task due to the speckle and processes that may cause false alarms. Azimuth ambiguities caused by the aliasing of the Doppler phase history are often visible in low radar backscatter background causing false positive. In this work we propose a method to resolve azimuth ambiguities for ship detection purposes that takes the complete benefit of full Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data combined with the high resolution capability of X-band sensors.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351863","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351863.pdf","startPage":"7621","endPage":"7624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Azimuth ambiguities removal for ship detection using full polarimetric X-band SAR data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351863/","displayDocTitle":"Azimuth ambiguities removal for ship detection using full polarimetric X-band SAR data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133662","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351863/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Azimuth ambiguities removal for ship detection using full polarimetric X-band SAR data","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0007621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042446S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6351894,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano Camps","affiliation":["Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech and IEECICRAE-UPC, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Camps","id":"37274832600"},{"name":"F.

In [4] and [5], recent experimental results from an ESA-sponsored airborne campaign carried out in June and November 2011 in the Baltic sea are presented using conventional and interferometric GNSS-R, respectively. In this work the properties of the measured interferometric GNSS-R waveforms are studied, and the wavelet transform is applied to compress and denoise the waveforms.

In the case of partial scatterers, the mainstream has so far been twofold, in that the tomographic reconstruction is conducted by either working directly with multiple looks and/or polarimetric channels or by exploiting the corresponding single-channel second order statistics. In this paper, we unify these two methodologies in the context of covariance fitting. In essence, we exploit the fact that both vertical structures as well as the unknown polarimetric signatures can be approximated in a low dimensional subspace. For this purpose, we make use of a wavelet basis in order to sparsely represent vertical structures. Additionally, we synthesize a data adaptive orthonormal basis that spans the space of polarimetric signatures. Finally, we validate this approach by using fully polarimetric L-band data acquired by the E-SAR sensor of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351904","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351904.pdf","startPage":"7472","endPage":"7475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data adaptive compressed sensing approach to polarimetric SAR tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351904/","displayDocTitle":"A data adaptive compressed sensing approach to polarimetric SAR tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133694","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351904/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data adaptive compressed sensing approach to polarimetric SAR tomography","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0007472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047978S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6351913,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoqiang Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Mineral Resources, China Metallurgical Geology Bureau, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoqiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"38580730500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6351913","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geology","Abstracts","Image resolution","Image analysis","Radiometry","Sensors","Optical reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geochemistry","geology","infrared spectra","iron","iron compounds","minerals","principal component analysis","radiometers","remote sensing","rocks","spectrochemical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mineral alteration anomaly zone extraction","Aster data","inner Mongolia","China","spectral measurements","advanced spacebome thermal emission","Manzhouli area","reflection radiometer","in situ","AI-OH","ferric-iron VNIR-SWIR absorption features","felsic rock spectra","ferrous-iron","Mg-OH absorption features","mafic rock spectra","ASTER ratio images","principal component analysis","mineral alteration anomaly","regional geological surveys","mineral alteration zones","AlOH","FeMgOH","Fe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mineral alteration anomaly","ASTER","Extraction","PCA","Manzhouli"]}],"abstract":"Spectral measurements made in the Manzhouli area, Inner Mongolia, China, using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, in the laboratory and in situ show dominantly Al-OH and ferric-iron VNIR-SWIR absorption features in felsic rock spectra and ferrousiron and Fe,Mg-OH absorption features in the mafic rock spectra.

Image super-resolution techniques can be applied to overcome the limits. This paper presents a new framework for improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images base by combing high-resolution spectral information and high-resolution spatial information by image fusion and compressed sensing. Based on the compressed sensing theory, small patches of hyperspectral observations from different wavelengths can be represented as weighted linear combinations of a small number of atoms in dictionary which is trained by using panchromatic images. Then hyperspectral image super-resolution is treated as a special image fusion problem with sparse constraints. To make the super-resolution reconstruction more accurate, local manifold projection is used as a regulation term. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution validate that proposed method achieves much better results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06351986.pdf","startPage":"7260","endPage":"7262","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral imagery super-resolution by image fusion and compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Hyperspectral imaging","Dictionaries","Manifolds","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","geophysical image processing","image fusion","image reconstruction","image representation","image resolution","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imagery super-resolution reconstruction","image fusion","high-resolution spectral information","high-resolution spatial information","compressed sensing theory","weighted linear combinations","panchromatic images","sparse constraints","local manifold projection","regulation term","hyperspectral observation representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral","sparse representation","super-resolution reconstruction","image fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6351986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral imagery super-resolution by image fusion and compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6351986/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133772","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral imagery super-resolution by image fusion and compressed sensing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0007260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041499S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6351986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6352035,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The recent incident in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates the potentially catastrophic nature of offshore oil spills. Illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection. Previous studies have shown that active microwave satellite sensors, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be effectively used for the detection and classification of oil spills. Oil spills appear as dark spots in SAR images. However, similar dark spots may arise from a range of unrelated meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, resulting in misidentification. A major focus of research in this area is the development of algorithms to distinguish oil spills from `look-alikes'. This paper describes the development of a new approach to SAR oil spill detection using two different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The first ANN segments a SAR image to identify pixels belonging to candidate oil spill features. A set of statistical feature parameters are then extracted and divided into subsets to facilitate sensitivity analyses. The second ANN classifies objects into oil spills or look-alikes according to their feature parameters. A pilot study employed sixty-two ERS-2 SAR and ENVSAT ASAR images of verified oil spills or look-alikes to train and evaluate the algorithm. Overall accuracies of 96.52 % were obtained for pixel segmentation and 95.2 % for feature classification. The segmentation approach outperformed established edge detection and adaptive thresholding techniques. An analysis of feature descriptors in the classification stage highlighted the importance of image gradient information.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352042","startPage":"5630","endPage":"5633","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352042.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of oil spill and look-alike spots from SAR imagery using an Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352042/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of oil spill and look-alike spots from SAR imagery using an Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352042/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13133828","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of oil spill and look-alike spots from SAR imagery using an Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056651S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6352049,"authors":[{"name":"Ryo Natsuaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Natsuaki","id":"37400379700"},{"name":"Akira Hirose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37298386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352049","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"abstract":"We evaluated our co-registration method which uses the number of SPs and amplitude information for ALOS data.

Data was acquired using the MITL's P-band, fully polarimetric SAR system along a circular trajectory with the beam spotted on the same area. Compared with the conventional SAR along a straight path, this imaging mode mainly has the following attractive features. First, observing from all directions can help for a better understanding of the scattering properties of targets. Second, the wide angular aperture obtained via flight in a circular track makes possible high resolutions with low frequency band. Third, the aspect angle diversity inherent to the circular track allows for a 3-D target reconstruction. This paper presents the SAR processing of such data, and shows several results to analyze the potentials and limitations of such imaging geometry.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352051","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","startPage":"5594","endPage":"5597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airborne circular SAR imaging: Results at P-band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Airborne circular SAR imaging: Results at P-band","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352051/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133837","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6352051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airborne circular SAR imaging: Results at P-band","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096902S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6352092,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Englhart","affiliation":["Biology Department II, GeoBio Center, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Planegg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Englhart","id":"38235032500"},{"name":"Jonas Franke","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc., Baierbrunn, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Franke","id":"37390856000"},{"name":"Vanessa Keuck","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc., Baierbrunn, Germany"],"firstName":"Vanessa","lastName":"Keuck","id":"38235033000"},{"name":"Florian Siegert","affiliation":["Biology Department II, GeoBio Center, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Planegg, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Siegert","id":"37445484500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"abstract":"Climate change mitigation mechanisms, such as REDD+, which aim at avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, require an accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring.

xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n). We adopt the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to approximate the nonlinear input-output mapping and propose the use of particle swarm optimization with mutation (MPSO) algorithm to adjust the weights in MLP. In the supervised training step, the input of the network is the measured C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n and the desired output is the C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n. MLP with optimal size 10-9-10 is chosen as the model. We have experiments in simulation and real data application. In simulation, there are 31 sets of simulated well log data, where 25 sets are used for training, and 6 sets are used for testing. After training the MLP network, input C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n, then C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n' can be inverted in testing process. Compared with radial basis function (RBF) networks and particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, the error of MPSO is the smallest. Also we apply it to the inversion of real field well log data. The result is acceptable. It shows that the proposed MPSO algorithm in MLP weight adjustments can perform the well log data inversion.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352214","startPage":"6103","endPage":"6106","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352214.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer perceptron with particle swarm optimization for well log data inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352214/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multilayer perceptron with particle swarm optimization for well log data inversion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352214/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13133411","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer perceptron with particle swarm optimization for well log data inversion","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0006103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099156S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6352219,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Urata","affiliation":["Aichi Prefectural University, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Urata","id":"38496450400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Yasukawa","affiliation":["Aichi Prefectural University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Yasukawa","id":"37282062000"},{"name":"Akitoshi Itai","affiliation":["Chubu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akitoshi","lastName":"Itai","id":"37282062600"},{"name":"Ichi Takumi","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichi","lastName":"Takumi","id":"37282063200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352219","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Ground penetrating radar","Geophysical measurement techniques","Earthquakes","Training data","Signal detection","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Earth crust","earthquakes","electromagnetic wave propagation","geophysical techniques","probability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave data","anomalous signal radiation","earth crust","earthquake precursor","extremely low frequency band","false detection techniques","HMM based anomalous signal detection","amplitude density distribution","electromagnetic wave signals","acceptance probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electromagnetic wave","Hidden Markov Model","extremely low frequency band","amplitude density distribution","signal detection"]}],"abstract":"Detection of an anomalous signal radiated from the earth's crust is useful for predicting the precursor of the earthquakes. Using the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) band, we have observed the electromagnetic (EM) wave. Various methods for detection of an anomalous signal have been proposed. The known problems for those techniques are related to a false detection due to the limitation of training data for great earthquake. We proposed the HMM based anomalous signal detection whose training data are the amplitude density distribution extracted from normal EM wave signals. However, acceptance probability in this technique is not corresponded appropriately to a change of anomalous signal. In this paper, anomalous signal detection using amplitude density distribution calculated by short term signals to track a temporal change is proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on clustering for anomalous signal detections from electromagnetic wave data","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352219","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352219.pdf","startPage":"6083","endPage":"6086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A study on clustering for anomalous signal detections from electromagnetic wave data","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352219/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on clustering for anomalous signal detections from electromagnetic wave data","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0006083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067317S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6352231,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In order to account for these errors, MOtion COmpensation (MOCO) algorithms are necessary. However, efficient implementation of such MOCO algorithms requires use of proper approximations in the sensor-to-target distance history, which may impair the accuracy of the final SAR images. To circumvent this problem, some methods, such as the PTA (which stands for Precise Topography- and Aperture- dependent) algorithm, have been recently devised in the literature. This paper discusses limits of the PTA algorithm and provides some modifications aimed at improving its performances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved topography and aperture dependent motion compensation algorithm","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352290","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352290.pdf","startPage":"5805","endPage":"5808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"An improved topography and aperture dependent motion compensation algorithm","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352290/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133481","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved topography and aperture dependent motion compensation algorithm","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058673S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6352339,"authors":[{"name":"Marie Chabert","affiliation":["IRIT-ENSEEIHT-T\u00e9SA, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Chabert","id":"37285148900"},{"name":"Bernard Lacaze","affiliation":["T\u00e9SA Laboratory, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Lacaze","id":"37285075000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352339","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Splines (mathematics)","Image resolution","Remote sensing","Interpolation","PSNR","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image reconstruction","image sampling","interpolation","optical images","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non uniform sampling","remote sensing optical image","uniform sampling device","image reconstruction","interpolation","aliasing","Lagrange reconstruction formula","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non uniform sampling","adaptive sampling","cubic spline interpolation","Lagrange formula"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352339","abstract":"This paper deals with non uniform sampling of remote sensing optical images. Non uniform sampling can model defects of the uniform sampling device such as grid distortion or dead pixels. Moreover, non uniform sampling can be intentionally introduced either for its good properties with respect to aliasing or in the case of variable rate devices such as telemetry and remote control. Image reconstruction from non uniform samples requires appropriate interpolation formulas taking into account the sample locations. This paper compares cubic spline interpolation and a modified Lagrangian formula in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) in the case of high resolution remote sensing optical images. Non uniform sampling shows a higher robustness with respect to aliasing than the classical uniform sampling. In case of non uniform sampling, the modified Lagrange reconstruction formula leads to a higher image quality than the cubic spline interpolation.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352339","startPage":"4718","endPage":"4721","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352339.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non uniform sampling for remote sensing images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Non uniform sampling for remote sensing images","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352339/","accessionNumber":"13133530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352339/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non uniform sampling for remote sensing images","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0004718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036491S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6352349,"authors":[{"name":"Thuy Le Toan","affiliation":["CESBIO, CNRS-CNES, IRD, Universit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Thuy","lastName":"Le Toan","id":"37273945500"},{"name":"Lars Ulander","affiliation":["Department of Radar Systems, FOI, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Ulander","id":"37284955100"},{"name":"Kostas Papathanassiou","affiliation":["DLR, German AeroSpace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Papathanassiou","id":"37269326900"},{"name":"Fabio Rocca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Rocca","id":"37269361200"},{"name":"Shaun Quegan","affiliation":["Centre for Terrestrial Carbon Dynamics, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Shaun","lastName":"Quegan","id":"37273943600"},{"name":"Malcolm Davidson","affiliation":["ESA, ESTEC, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Davidson","id":"37266893100"},{"name":"Klaus Scipal","affiliation":["ESA, ESTEC, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Scipal","id":"37269341200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352349","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomass","Synthetic aperture radar","Backscatter","Scattering","Tomography","Surfaces","Soil moisture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","data acquisition","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","vegetation","vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BIOMASS mission retrieval algorithm","above-ground forest biomass","national scale inventory","global carbon flux calculation","advanced P-band SAR technique","P-band biomass measurement","preparatory phase","tropical forest","boreal forest","advanced P-band SAR data","airborne campaign"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BIOMASS mission","P-band SAR","polarimetry","Pol-InSAR","tomography","retrieval algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352349","abstract":"The BIOMASS mission is designed to map the full range of the world's above-ground forest biomass, for the needs of national scale inventory and global carbon flux calculations.

Many collect these data at discrete locations over specific time periods using temperature sensors, however it is becoming more common to gather thermal imagery to have a spatially distributed understanding. The utility of these data can be limited due to cost, and spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper presents a platform for low-cost high-resolution thermal imagery using an unmanned aerial vehicle (AggieAir\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n). AggieAir can be used to acquire visual, near-infrared (NIR), and thermal imagery at high spatial and temporal resolutions at a much lower cost when compared to conventional sources of remote sensing. In this application, AggieAir is used to collect visual, NIR, and thermal imagery for a stream in northern Utah. Details about the payload and postprocessing methods are presented. The resulting imagery was used to clip the thermal mosaic to only include pixels associated with the stream. This thermal image provided 30cm\u00d730cm resolution stream temperatures. Finally, a simple method of adjusting the images to observed temperatures is proposed to provide better information regarding absolute stream temperatures which are key in understanding the health of the aquatic ecosystem.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352476.pdf","startPage":"5049","endPage":"5052","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352476","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352476","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Cameras","Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Land surface temperature","Remote sensing","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","geophysical image processing","image segmentation","ocean temperature","oceanographic equipment","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal remote sensing","autonomous unmanned aerial remote sensing platform","surface stream temperatures","stream temperature","temperature sensors","thermal imagery","low-cost high-resolution thermal imagery","unmanned aerial vehicle","AggieAir","remote sensing sources","northern Utah","pay-load method","postprocessing method","thermal mosaic","aquatic ecosystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal Infrared","TIR","Stream Temperature","Remote Sensing","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","UAV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352476/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal remote sensing with an autonomous unmanned aerial remote sensing platform for surface stream temperatures","accessionNumber":"13133167","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6352476/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal remote sensing with an autonomous unmanned aerial remote sensing platform for surface stream temperatures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044021S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6352477,"authors":[{"name":"Fausto G.

The use of aircrafts is becoming increasingly common in carrying out this task mainly because of its speed and effectiveness in the spraying operation. However, some factors may reduce the yield, or even cause damage (e.g. crop areas not covered in the spraying process, overlapping spraying of crop areas, applying pesticides on the outer edge of the crop). Climatic conditions, such as the intensity and direction of the wind while spraying add further complexity to the control problem. In this paper, we describe an architecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can be employed to implement a control loop for agricultural applications where UAVs are responsible for spraying chemicals on crops. The process of applying the chemicals is controlled by means of the feedback obtained from the wireless sensor network (WSN) deployed on the crop field. The aim of this solution is to support short delays in the control loop so that the spraying UAV can process the information from the sensors. We evaluate an algorithm to adjust the UAV route under changes in wind intensity and direction. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the number of communication messages between the UAV and the WSN. Results show that the adjustment of the route based on the feedback information from the sensors could minimize the waste of pesticides.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor network in agricultural applications","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352477","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352477.pdf","startPage":"5045","endPage":"5048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor network in agricultural applications","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352477/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor network in agricultural applications","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069654S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6352480,"authors":[{"name":"Helmut Essen","affiliation":["Maxonic GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Essen","id":"37299574400"},{"name":"Winfried Johannes","affiliation":["Fraunhofer-FHR.

The design followed the FM-CW principle, to get the highest possible average transmit power and thus the best range performance. The experiments described here were conducted at a centre frequency of 94 GHz. An inertial system of high quality, based upon a fibre optic gyroscope maintained the necessary precision, to allow high resolution SAR imaging. The raw data are transmitted to the ground station using an ordinary analogue data link, where they are A/D converted, preprocessed and finally undergo a real-time SAR-focusing algorithm. Additionally to the quick-look processing the data are stored to be able to apply further high quality SAR processing. The paper describes the design principles and gives results from the flight tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352480.pdf","startPage":"5033","endPage":"5036","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution W-band UAV SAR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Sensors","Real-time systems","Radar antennas","Chirp","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical equipment","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band UAV SAR","miniaturised millimetre wave radar","MIRANDA","synthetic aperture radar","unmanned helicopter","FM-CW principle","average transmit power","fibre optic gyroscope","SAR imaging","ordinary analogue data link","real-time SAR-focusing algorithm","quick-look processing","high quality SAR processing","frequency 94 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","mm- waves","UAV","High Resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"High resolution W-band UAV SAR","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133171","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution W-band UAV SAR","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0005033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08064S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6352528,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Matteoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Matteoli","id":"37546337200"},{"name":"Marco Diani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Diani","id":"37269423000"},{"name":"Giovanni Corsini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Corsini","id":"37269421300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352528","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contamination","Hyperspectral imaging","Covariance matrix","Pollution measurement","Noise","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local hyperspectral anomalies","target signal contamination","local RX anomaly detection performance","analytical model","contamination fraction","contaminating signal strength","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","hyperspectral imagery","signal contamination","covariance matrix"]}],"abstract":"This work investigates the effects of target signal contamination over local RX anomaly detection performance.

The goals of the program are: 1) To develop high-resolution, three-dimensional mapping of the atmospheric conditions, focusing on the boundary layer, to detect and forecast severe wind, tornado, hail, ice, and flash flood hazards. 2) To create impacts-based, neighborhood-scale warnings and forecasts for a range of public and private decision-makers that result in measureable benefit for public safety and the economy. 3) To demonstrate the value of collaborative, adaptive X-band radar networks to existing and future National Weather Service sensors, products, performance metrics, and decision-making; and assess optimal combinations of observing systems. The centerpiece of the Dallas Fort Worth Urban Demonstration Network will be an 8-node, boundary-layer, dual polarized, multi-Doppler X-band CASA radar network. Additional in-situ and remote sensors will enable fusion of observations from all sensors. Data products will include single and multi-radar data, vector wind, Quantitative precipitation estimation, nowcasting, and analysis and numerical weather prediction products. Research and Research to operations in the DFW Urban Demonstration Network will occur in a quasi-operational environment. New technology and products will be integrated into operational platforms for evaluation by a variety of users during real-time weather events. Users include NWS forecasters and emergency managers; users from transportation, utilities, regional airports, arenas, and the media will be added in the near future. In this way, CASA's multidisciplinary team - engineers, computer scientists, social scientists (sociologists, geographer, economist), meteorologists, hydrologists - will conduct \u201cend-to-end\u201d research from sensor observation, to product development and validation linked to end user decision-making, response and value.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352574.pdf","startPage":"6911","endPage":"6913","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Dallas Fort Worth urban remote sensing network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Meteorological radar","Wind forecasting","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric measuring apparatus","atmospheric techniques","remote sensing by radar","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dallas Fort Worth","urban remote sensing network","Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere","CASA","North Central Texas Council of Governments","NCTCOG","DFW Urban Demonstration Network","atmospheric condition mapping","wind hazard","tornado hazard","hail hazard","ice hazard","flash flood hazard","neighborhood-scale warnings","public safety","adaptive X-band radar networks","National Weather Service sensors","performance metrics","boundary-layer","dual polarized network","multiDoppler X-band CASA radar network","numerical weather prediction products","quasioperational environment","real-time weather events","CASA multidisciplinary team"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CASA","Radar","QPE","urban flooding","DFW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Dallas Fort Worth urban remote sensing network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13133263","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dallas Fort Worth urban remote sensing network","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0006911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04432S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6352575,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of them is represented by the automatic detection and counting of cars. In this paper, we propose a novel car detection method. It starts with a feature extraction process based on scalar invariant feature transform (SIFT) thanks to which a set of keypoints is identified in the considered image and opportunely described. Successively, the process discriminates between keypoints assigned to cars and those associated with all remaining objects by means of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results have been conducted on a real UAV scene.

The small size was achieved through a number of design innovations. The active die was implemented on a high-performance biHEMT process, which comprises E and D-mode pHEMT FETS with HBT bipolar transistors. This enabled a highlevel on on-chip integration. For the quadrature combiner a new circuit was developed which is very compact compared to classic architectures and has low insertion loss. Likewise, a high-performance compact on-die four-port quadrature splitter was developed for the interstage. The latter was smaller than previous solutions with improved performance. In a further innovation, the output harmonic terminations, bias chokes and combiner were implemented on an Integrated Passive Device (IPD) process for reasons of size and cost. The GaAs and IPD die were both Cu bump flip-chip mounted bringing advantages in size, cost, and device yield. Cost and performance variability were reduced as no critical RF functions were included in the laminate.","doi":"10.1109/BCTM.2012.6352619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BCTM.2012.6352619","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6336950/6352611/06352619.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6352611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Innovative architectures for advanced handset power amplifier performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Innovative architectures for advanced handset power amplifier performance","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352619/","accessionNumber":"13117490","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352619/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Innovative architectures for advanced handset power amplifier performance","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"P32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045582S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6336950","isNumber":"6352611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6336950","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6352611","articleId":"6352619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6352620,"authors":[{"name":"Ruili Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ruili","lastName":"Wu","id":"37898672000"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37538192100"},{"name":"Weibo Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Weibo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37710522600"},{"name":"Jerry Lopez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Lopez","id":"37285403800"},{"name":"Donald Y.

It is shown that the realization of such DACs in advanced processes provides power and area reduction combined with faster signaling. However, it is very challenging to improve the SFDR at a certain given output swing and sampling frequency. It is demonstrated that the SFDR can be doubled by using an optimized cascode switch. It is also concluded that compared to MOSFET based approaches higher sampling frequencies can be achieved by bipolar transistor based DACs if the SFDR and transition frequency are fixed. The reason is the higher Early voltage of bipolar transistors.","doi":"10.1109/BCTM.2012.6352646","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6336950/6352611/06352646.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BCTM.2012.6352646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6352611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SFDR considerations for current steering high-speed digital to analog converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352646/","displayDocTitle":"SFDR considerations for current steering high-speed digital to analog converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117513","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6352646/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SFDR considerations for current steering high-speed digital to analog converters","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"P103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057698S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6336950","isNumber":"6352611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6336950","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6352611","articleId":"6352646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6352657,"authors":[{"name":"Robert L.

Extracted features from multi-temporal SAR data-namely, the average backscattering coefficient, backscatter temporal variability, and long-term coherence and reflectance values from optical data, are integrated with GLCM mean textural data in the framework. Classification results were generated by taking Osaka City, Japan, as the study area. The selected major classes were built-up areas, fields, woodlands, and water bodies. The most suitable data used for classification is the multi-temporal SAR and an optical data fusion with the mean textural, because of the supplement of different data used and the smoothing effect on the images of the texture. Moreover, the higher quality training samples obtained by using the combined SVM and NN-based SS method for training the Bayesian classifier generated the highest classification accuracies in all of

transfer of knowledge from research community to specialized remote sensing software has been extremely slow hindering the application of ANN techniques in remote sensing field. There are many variants of ANN depending upon its topology and its learning paradigms but Multilayer perception (MLP) with back propagation (BP) is widely used in remote sensing despite its limitation such as fine tuning of numbers of input parameters such as learning rate, momentum, number of hidden layers and number of hidden nodes. In this paper, recently proposed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) version of ANN which is extremely fast and does not require any iterative learning is introduced. In ELM classifier, only number of neurons required has to be fine-tuned unlike numerous parameters in MLP. To disseminate, its use to wider audience in remote sensing field, its implementation in MATLAB in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is described. The developed GUI is capable of handling large image files by employing a smarter technique of supplying rectangular chunk of image data through object oriented image adapter class and provides a simple and effective computation environment for performing ELM classification with accuracy assessment.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352700","pdfPath":"/iel5/6334512/6350328/06352700.pdf","startPage":"6301","endPage":"6304","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) beyond cots remote sensing packages: Implementation of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in MATLAB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) beyond cots remote sensing packages: Implementation of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in MATLAB","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13133333","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6352700/","conferenceDate":"22-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) beyond cots remote sensing packages: Implementation of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in MATLAB","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"0006301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041117S","chronDate":"22-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6334512","isNumber":"6350328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6334512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6350328","articleId":"6352700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6352756,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Moss","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Technologies, Alcorn State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Victoria","lastName":"Moss","id":"38508492400"},{"name":"Delandria Jones","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Technologies, Alcorn State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Delandria","lastName":"Jones","id":"38501641000"},{"name":"Sam Nwaneri","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Technologies, Alcorn State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Nwaneri","id":"37396777700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1159-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1160-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1158-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2153-6996"}],"articleNumber":"6352756","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"Infrastructure protection [1] has become obvious that the successful use of unmanned aerial vehicles is now a requirement in homeland security. The success lies with the fact that these vehicles collect and process data, gather intelligence, and execute commands with feedbacks. The feedbacks are sent to different platforms for further analysis, which reveals that the infusion of such technology into homeland security management is a strong statement of needs and purpose. To meet the challenges posed by technology modeling in homeland security, a mission that measures or countermeasures terror plots must deploy a vehicle of a transportation system against the target-and-delivery systems (TADS) terrorists use in plotting and reaching their targets. This paper examined threats and counter responsibilities that require the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The objective is to identify domestic/international threats and special missions of UAVs that measures or counter-measures defined threats, without collateral loss or compromise of the safety and privacy of the general public. The result restricted UAVs' special missions to border counties if/when necessary. Acknowledgement: This material is based upon work supported by the US.

By using nonlinear compensation (NLC) based on the low-pass filter (LPF) assisted digital back propagation (DBP) algorithm, a transmission distance of 2700 km is demonstrated with moderate complexity (0.25 backpropagation steps/span) and good robustness to deviation of the algorithm parameters from their optimum values. Compared to the standard DBP algorithm, the LPF assisted DBP algorithm can allow a reduction in the number of NLC steps/span, but with an increased computational complexity for each step. The two DBP algorithms are compared in terms of the number of real multiplications per bit, thus allowing the algorithm with lower complexity to be determined for a given level of performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinearity Compensation of 224 Gb/s Dual-Polarization 16-QAM Transmission Over 2700 km","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2012.2227111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6384834/06352837.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2012.2227111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinearity Compensation of 224 Gb/s Dual-Polarization 16-QAM Transmission Over 2700 km","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6352837/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13188157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinearity Compensation of 224 Gb/s Dual-Polarization 16-QAM Transmission Over 2700 km","sourcePdf":"lpt-cartledge-2227111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06181S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6384834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6384834","articleId":"6352837","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6352863,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37405713200"},{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625900"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6352863","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2627},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Feeds","Bandwidth","Microstrip","Microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","loop antennas","microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential-phase feed","circularly polarized shorted loop structure","4-port feeding structure","CP shorted loop","single-fed circularly polarized cornertruncated patch array","loop four shorting strips","stable phase difference","SP feed","axial ratio bandwidth","AR bandwidth","frequency 4.86 GHz to 5.12 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array feeds","circular polarization","loop antennas"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sequential-Phase Feed Using a Circularly Polarized Shorted Loop Structure","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2227103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6471758","endPage":"1447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6471758/06352863.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2227103","startPage":"1443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352863","abstract":"This communication presents a new 4-port feeding structure with sequential phase (SP) of 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0 and 270 using a circularly polarized (CP) shorted loop.

The heavy-duty Dickson's pump turns on for swift recovery from the drastic charge loss and turns off for reduced noise during the hold-and-sensing period. An instantaneous pumping stroke of the charge pump controller and a low dropout following the charge pumps further reduce supply noise.

Induction motor (IM), surface-mounted permanent-magnet (PM) (SPM), and interior PM (IPM) synchronous motor drives are investigated, with reference to a common vehicle specification. The IM is penalized by the cage loss, but it is less expensive and inherently safe in case of inverter unwilled turnoff due to natural de-excitation. The SPM motor has a simple construction and shorter end connections, but it is penalized by eddy-current loss at high speed, has a very limited transient overload power, and has a high uncontrolled generator voltage. The IPM motor shows the better performance compromise, but it might be more complicated to be manufactured. Analytical relationships are first introduced and then validated on three example designs and finite element calculated, accounting for core saturation, harmonic losses, the effects of skewing, and operating temperature. The merits and limitations of the three solutions are quantified comprehensively and summarized by the calculation of the energy consumption over the standard New European Driving Cycle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","volume":"48","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13191400","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6352905/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Induction and PM Synchronous Motor Drives for EV Application Including Design Examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Induction and PM Synchronous Motor Drives for EV Application Including Design Examples","sourcePdf":"tia-pellegrino-2227092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102198S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6399585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"6399585","articleId":"6352905","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6352910,"authors":[{"name":"Aslan Tchamkerten","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Aslan","lastName":"Tchamkerten","id":"38571909300"},{"name":"Venkat Chandar","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Chandar","id":"37546049200"},{"name":"Gregory W.

In the system model of interest, the codeword is transmitted at a random time within a prescribed window whose length corresponds to the level of asynchronism between the transmitter and the receiver. The decoder operates sequentially and communication rate is defined as the ratio between the message size and the elapsed time between when transmission commences and when the decoder makes a decision. For such systems, general upper and lower bounds on capacity as a function of the level of asynchronism are established, and are shown to coincide in some nontrivial cases. From these bounds, several properties of this asynchronous capacity are derived. In addition, the performance of training-based schemes is investigated. It is shown that such schemes, which implement synchronization and information transmission on separate degrees of freedom in the encoding, cannot achieve the asynchronous capacity in general, and that the penalty is particularly significant in the high-rate regime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Synchronization","Receivers","Transmitters","Reliability","Noise","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous communication rate","asynchronous capacity bounds","asynchronous point to point communication","system model","codeword","asynchronism","decoder","information transmission","encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous communication","bursty communication","error exponents","large deviations","sequential decoding","sparse communication","synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2227238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06352910.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2227238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Communication: Capacity Bounds and Suboptimality of Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Communication: Capacity Bounds and Suboptimality of Training","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352910/","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13307116","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Communication: Capacity Bounds and Suboptimality of Training","sourcePdf":"tit-tchamkerten-2227238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060268S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6352910","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6352911,"authors":[{"name":"Pascal O.

Namely, we show that the Bethe free energy function is convex and that the sum-product algorithm finds its minimum efficiently. We then discuss the fact that the permanent is lower bounded by the Bethe permanent, and we comment on potential upper bounds on the permanent based on the Bethe permanent. We also present a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent in terms of permanents of so-called lifted versions of the matrix under consideration.

We address the rebuilding ratio problem, namely, in the case of erasures, what is the fraction of the remaining information that needs to be accessed in order to rebuild exactly the lost information? It is clear that when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures that an MDS code can correct, then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the remaining information). However, the interesting and more practical case is when the number of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability of the code. For example, consider an MDS code that can correct two erasures: What is the smallest amount of information that one needs to access in order to correct a single erasure? Previous work showed that the rebuilding ratio is bounded between [1/2] and [3/4]; however, the exact value was left as an open problem. In this paper, we solve this open problem and prove that for the case of a single erasure with a two-erasure correcting code, the rebuilding ratio is [1/2].

Reliable detection of retinal hemorrhages is important in the development of automated screening systems which can be translated into practice. Under our supervised approach, retinal color images are partitioned into nonoverlapping segments covering the entire image. Each segment, i.e., splat, contains pixels with similar color and spatial location. A set of features is extracted from each splat to describe its characteristics relative to its surroundings, employing responses from a variety of filter bank, interactions with neighboring splats, and shape and texture information. An optimal subset of splat features is selected by a filter approach followed by a wrapper approach. A classifier is trained with splat-based expert annotations and evaluated on the publicly available Messidor dataset. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 is achieved at the splat level and 0.87 at the image level.

With kinematic constraints, the probability of obtaining a valid configuration by sampling in the joint ambient space is not low but null, which complicates the direct application of sampling-based path planners. This paper presents the AtlasRRT algorithm, which is a planner especially tailored for such constrained systems that builds on recently developed tools for higher-dimensional continuation. These tools provide procedures to define charts that locally parametrize a manifold and to coordinate the charts, forming an atlas that fully covers it. AtlasRRT simultaneously builds an atlas and a bidirectional rapidly exploring random tree (RRT), using the atlas to sample configurations and to grow the branches of the RRTs, and the RRTs to devise directions of expansion for the atlas. The efficiency of AtlasRRT is evaluated in several benchmarks involving high-dimensional manifolds embedded in large ambient spaces. The results show that the combined use of the atlas and the RRTs produces a more rapid exploration of the configuration space manifolds than existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Planning Under Kinematic Constraints by Rapidly Exploring Manifolds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2222272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6428720/06352929.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2222272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Path Planning Under Kinematic Constraints by Rapidly Exploring Manifolds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6352929/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13270793","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning Under Kinematic Constraints by Rapidly Exploring Manifolds","sourcePdf":"tro-jaillet-2222272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099113S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6428720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6428720","articleId":"6352929","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6352932,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6594872/6352932/6352932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiyuan Xie received the Ph.D. degree in optical engineering from the Chinese Academy of Science in 2009.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong.

In large scale optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs), crosstalk noise could cause severe performance degradation and prevent ONoC from communicating properly. The novel contribution of this paper is the systematical modeling and analysis of the crosstalk noise and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of optical routers and mesh-based ONoCs using a formal method. Formal analytical models for the worst-case crosstalk noise and minimum SNR in mesh-based ONoCs are presented. The crosstalk analysis is performed at device, router, and network levels. A general 5 \u00d7 5 optical router model is proposed for router level analysis. The minimum SNR optical link candidates, which constrain the scalability of mesh-based ONoCs, are identified. It is also shown that symmetric mesh-based ONoCs have the best SNR performance. The presented formal analyses can be easily applied to other optical routers and mesh-based ONoCs. Finally, we present case studies of mesh-based ONoCs using the optimized crossbar and Crux optical routers to evaluate the proposed formal method. We find that crosstalk noise can significantly limit the scalability of mesh-based ONoCs. For example, when the mesh-based ONoC size, using optimized crossbar, is larger than 8 \u00d7 8, the optical signal power is smaller than the crosstalk noise power; when the network size is 16 \u00d7 16 and the input power is 0 dBm, in the worst-case, the signal power is -24.9 dBm and the crosstalk noise power is -11 dBm.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2220573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6594872/06352932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2220573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6594872","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formal Worst-Case Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Mesh-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6352932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Formal Worst-Case Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Mesh-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767604","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6352932/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal Worst-Case Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Mesh-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-nikdast-2220573-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129793S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6594872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6594872","articleId":"6352932","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6352933,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew B.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a popular energy reduction technique that allows a hardware design to reduce average power consumption while still enabling the design to meet a high-performance target when necessary. To conserve energy, many DVFS-based embedded and mobile devices often spend a large fraction of their lifetimes in a low-power mode. However, DVFS designs produced by conventional multimode CAD flows tend to have significant energy overheads when operating outside of the peak performance mode, even when they are operating in a low-power mode. A dedicated core can be added for low-energy operation, but has a high cost in terms of area and leakage. In this paper, we explore the DVFS design space to identify the factors that affect DVFS efficiency. Based on our insights, we propose two design-level techniques to enhance the energy efficiency of DVFS for energy constrained systems. First, we present a context-aware DVFS design flow that considers the intrinsic characteristics of the hardware design, as well as the operating scenario-including the relative amounts of time spent in different modes, the range of performance scalability, and the target efficiency metric-to optimize the design for maximum energy efficiency. We also present a selective replication-based DVFS design methodology that identifies hardware modules for which context-aware multimode design may be inefficient and creates dedicated module replicas for different operating modes for such modules. We show that context-aware design can reduce average power by up to 20% over a conventional multimode design flow. Selective replication can reduce average power by an additional 4%. We also use the generated insights to identify microarchitectural decisions that impact DVFS efficiency.

However, optimum beamforming for spatially correlated or uncorrelated MISO Rician fading channels with a nonunit transmit covariance matrix has received less attention and remains a complex multidimensional optimization problem. This paper first proves that this convex constrained optimization problem can be reduced to only one dimension; hence, it can be solved very fast using standard 1-D search algorithms. Then, simulations mainly performed for linear equispaced antenna arrays demonstrate that: 1) the proposed method for the calculation of the optimum beamformer has significantly lower computational complexity compared with other currently used multidimensional algorithms; and 2) the optimum beamformer further improves capacity compared with the (single-stream) beamforming transmission that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, whereas in some operational environments, it achieves ergodic capacity that is very close or equal to the maximum ergodic capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13307184","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Capacity Optimization for Single-Stream Beamforming Transmission in MISO Rician Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Capacity Optimization for Single-Stream Beamforming Transmission in MISO Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-kontaxis-2227151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050287S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6352936","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6352939,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Haboba","affiliation":["ARCES University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6352939/6352939-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Javier Haboba (S'11) received the Electrical Engineering degree from the National University of La Plata, Argentina in 2005, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information technology at the University of Bologna, Italy, mainly studying analog-to-information converter architectures, and its hardware implementation.","Since 2005, he has worked in a variety of different projects at private companies and academic institutions.

To do so, the most common architectures are analyzed when saturation of some building blocks is taken into account, and when measurements are subject to quantization to produce a digital stream. Furthermore, the signal reconstruction is performed by established and novel algorithms (one based on linear programming and the other based on iterative guessing of the support of the target signal), as well as their specialization to the particular architecture producing the measurements. Performance is assessed both as the probability of correct support reconstruction and as the final reconstruction error. Our results help highlighting pros and cons of various architectures and giving quantitative answers to some typical design-oriented questions. Among these, we show: 1) that the (Random Modulation Pre-Integration) RMPI architecture and its recently proposed adjustments are probably the most versatile approach though not always the most economic to implement; 2) that when 1-bit quantization is sought, dynamically mixing quantization and integration in a randomized \u0394\u03a3 architecture help bringing the performance much closer to that of multi-bit approaches; 3) for each architecture, the trade-off between number of measurements and number of bits per measurements (given a fixed bit-budget); and 4) pros and cons of the use of Gaussian versus binary random variables for signal acquisition.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2220392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2220392","startPage":"443","endPage":"459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06352939.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pragmatic Look at Some Compressive Sensing Architectures With Saturation and Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Pragmatic Look at Some Compressive Sensing Architectures With Saturation and Quantization","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13167816","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6352939/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pragmatic Look at Some Compressive Sensing Architectures With Saturation and Quantization","sourcePdf":"jetcas-rovatti-2220392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109692S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6352939","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6352940,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Venerus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6507572/6352940/6352940-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Venerus (M'05) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in information engineering and the M.S. degree (summa cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2005 and 2007 respectively.","Since January 2008 he has been pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of California, San Diego, as part of the Integrated Signal Processing Group."]},"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Venerus","id":"38666728900"},{"name":"Ian Galton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6507572/6352940/6352940-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Galton (F'09) received the B.Sc. degree from Brown University, Providence, RI, in 1984, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1989 and 1992, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Since 1996 he has been a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, San Diego where he teaches and conducts research in the field of mixed-signal integrated circuits and systems for communications.

The horizontal extensions allow larger and more balanced moduli sets, resulting in an improvement of the RNS arithmetic computation, at the cost of lower reverse conversion performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2220460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2220460","startPage":"1487","endPage":"1500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6519344/06352941.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6519344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RNS Reverse Converters for Moduli Sets With Dynamic Ranges up to --bit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6352941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"RNS Reverse Converters for Moduli Sets With Dynamic Ranges up to <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$(8n+1)$</tex> </formula>-bit","volume":"60","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13529194","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6352941/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RNS Reverse Converters for Moduli Sets With Dynamic Ranges up to <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$(8n+1)$</tex> </formula>-bit","sourcePdf":"tcsi-sousa-2220460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102572S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6519344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6519344","articleId":"6352941","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353102,"authors":[{"name":"Xinran Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xinran Cai received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.

Nearly all nanoparticle designs have been considered in the optical regime where metals provide readily available negative permittivities, but where high-index dielectrics are uncommon. By moving to the infrared regime, high-index dielectrics can be used, which allow a greater variety of core-shell designs by admitting the appearance of magnetic resonances. By properly designing a core-shell nanoparticle to engineer the simultaneous excitation of both the magnetic and electric resonances with appropriate amplitudes, highly resonant particles with minimal backscattering can be achieved. Configurations that integrate these minimal backscattering designs with interfaces lead to potential thermal emission control surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2012.2227248","startPage":"4700209","endPage":"4700209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/6508868/06353121.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2012.2227248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6508868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Excitation of Electric and Magnetic Dipole Modes in a Resonant Core-Shell Particle at Infrared Frequencies to Achieve Minimal Backscattering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Magnetic cores","Silicon carbide","Magnetic resonance","Permittivity","Materials","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","magnetic moments","nanoparticles","nanophotonics","permittivity","plasmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric dipole modes","magnetic dipole modes","resonant core-shell particle","infrared frequencies","minimal backscattering","plasmonic nanoparticles","negative permittivity material","dielectric layer","plasmon resonances","nanoparticle designs","optical regime","high-index dielectrics","infrared regime","core-shell designs","magnetic resonances","core-shell nanoparticle","electric resonances","thermal emission control surfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","infrared metamaterials","nanostructured materials","plasmonics","polaritonic materials","thermal engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Excitation of Electric and Magnetic Dipole Modes in a Resonant Core-Shell Particle at Infrared Frequencies to Achieve Minimal Backscattering","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6353121/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13474499","externalId":"4700209","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Excitation of Electric and Magnetic Dipole Modes in a Resonant Core-Shell Particle at Infrared Frequencies to Achieve Minimal Backscattering","sourcePdf":"jstqe-ziolkowski-2227248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068659S","chronDate":"May-June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6508868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6508868","articleId":"6353121","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6353124,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Under both total and individual relay power constraints, we propose two schemes, namely secrecy rate maximization (SRM) beamforming and null-space beamforming. In the first scheme, our design problem is based on SRM. Using a suboptimal, but convex, technique-semidefinite relaxation (SDR), we show that this problem can be handled by performing a one-dimensional search which involves solving a sequence of semidefinite programs (SDPs). To reduce the complexity, in the second scheme, we instead maximize the information rate at the destination while completely eliminating the information leakage to all eavesdroppers. We prove that this problem can be exactly solved by SDR with one SDP only. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the two proposed designs.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2227313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6353967/06353150.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2227313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Secure Beamforming for AF Relay Networks With Multiple Eavesdroppers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Secure Beamforming for AF Relay Networks With Multiple Eavesdroppers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353150/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13136174","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353150/","volume":"20","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Secure Beamforming for AF Relay Networks With Multiple Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"lsp-ma-2227313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080715S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6353967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6353967","articleId":"6353150","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353164,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University ofWisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6471758/6353164/6353164-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meng Li (S'09) was born in Baoquanling, China.

The WN presented here is a member of fixed-grid WNs that is formed with no need of training. In this WN, after formation of wavelet lattice, determining shift and scale parameters of wavelets with two screening stage and selecting effective wavelets, orthogonal least squares algorithm is used to calculate the network weights and to optimize the network structure. The existence of two stages of screening increases globality of the wavelet lattice and provides a better estimation of the function especially for larger scales. R, G, and B values of a dermoscopy image are considered as the network inputs and the network structure formation. Then, the image is segmented and the skin lesions exact boundary is determined accordingly. The segmentation algorithm were applied to 30 dermoscopic images and evaluated with 11 different metrics, using the segmentation result obtained by a skilled pathologist as the ground truth.

A high control rate is strongly required in order to achieve high-performance scaled bilateral teleoperation. Hence, the control algorithm is implemented by the FPGA. In order to design a sufficient logic circuit for the FPGA, general optimization approaches are presented that aim to minimize hardware resources and to optimize the control rate.

The outage probability, on the other hand, is widely used to analyze the relationship among the communication efficiency, reliability, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and channel fading. To the best of our knowledge, the previous works only studied the asymptotic outage performance of the parallel fading channels which are only valid for a large number of subchannels or high SNRs. In this paper, a unified performance metric, which we shall refer to as the outage exponent, will be proposed. Our approach is mainly based on the large deviations theory and Meijer's \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n-function. It is shown that the proposed outage exponent is not only an accurate estimation of the outage probability for any number of subchannels, any SNR, and any target transmission rate, but also provides an easy way to compute the outage capacity, finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, and SNR gain. The asymptotic performance metrics, such as the delay-limited capacity, ergodic capacity, and diversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be directly obtained by letting the number of subchannels or SNR tend to infinity. Similar to Gallager's error exponent, a reliable function for parallel fading channels, which illustrates a fundamental relationship between the transmission reliability and efficiency, can also be defined from the outage exponent. Therefore, the proposed outage exponent provides a complete and comprehensive performance measure for parallel fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353210/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13307119","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage Exponent: A Unified Performance Metric for Parallel Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Exponent: A Unified Performance Metric for Parallel Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-bai-2227454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084434S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6461106","articleId":"6353210","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6353211,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Dong Xia received the B.S. degree in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2009, the M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2011.","He is currently a software engineer at Amazon, Seattle, WA, US.

It is proved that such a unitary UFCP code assures the unique identification of both channel coefficients and transmitted signals in a noise-free case as well as full diversity for the noncoherent maximum likelihood receiver in a noise case. To further improve error performance, an optimal unitary UFCP code is designed by appropriately and uniquely factorizing a pair of energy-efficient cross quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to maximize the coding gain subject to a transmission bit rate constraint. After a deep investigation of the fractional coding gain function, a technical approach developed in this paper to maximizing the coding gain is to carefully design an energy scale to compress the first three largest energy points in the corner of the QAM constellations in the denominator of the objective as well as carefully design a constellation triple forming two UFCPs, with one collaborating with the other two so as to make the accumulated minimum Euclidean distance along the two transmitter antennas in the numerator of the objective as large as possible, and at the same time, to avoid as many corner points of the QAM constellations with the largest energy as possible to achieve the minimum of the numerator. In other words, the optimal coding gain is attained by intelligent constellations collaboration and efficient energy compression. Computer simulations demonstrate that error performance of the optimal unitary UFCP code presented in this paper outperforms those of the differential code and the signal-to-noise-ratio-efficient training code.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Full Diversity Collaborative Unitary Space-Time Block Code Designs via Unique Factorization of Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2227453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06353211.pdf","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2227453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Full Diversity Collaborative Unitary Space-Time Block Code Designs via Unique Factorization of Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6353211/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13307120","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Full Diversity Collaborative Unitary Space-Time Block Code Designs via Unique Factorization of Signals","sourcePdf":"tit-zhang-2227453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.293877S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6461106","articleId":"6353211","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353220,"authors":[{"name":"Fatin Zaklouta","affiliation":["Robotics Center, Mines-Paris Tech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6357363/6353220/6353220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fatin Zaklouta received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Passau, Passau, Germany, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree from MINES ParisTech\u2013ARMINES, Paris, France, in 2011.","She is currently working on pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition with applications in advanced driver assistance systems and video surveillance systems.

The tracking performance is measured by control input energy and the energy of the error signal between the output of the system and the reference signal with respect to a Brownian motion random process. This paper focuses on two kinds of network parameters, the basic network parameter-bandwidth and the additive colored white Gaussian noise, and studies the tracking performance limitation problem. The best attainable tracking performance is obtained, and the impact of limited bandwidth and additive colored white Gaussian noise of the communication channel on the attainable tracking performance is revealed. It is shown that the optimal tracking performance depends on nonminimum phase zeros, gain at all frequencies and their directions unitary vector of the given plant, as well as the limited bandwidth and additive colored white Gaussian noise of the communication channel. The simulation results are finally given to illustrate the theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","volume":"60","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13196202","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353226/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Tracking Performance Limitation of Networked Control Systems With Limited Bandwidth and Additive Colored White Gaussian Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Tracking Performance Limitation of Networked Control Systems With Limited Bandwidth and Additive Colored White Gaussian Noise","sourcePdf":"tcsi-guan-2215717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098739S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6403532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6403532","articleId":"6353226","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353228,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Lu","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","College of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37964342100"},{"name":"Renquan Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China","Institute of Systems Science Academy ofMathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Renquan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37537066300"},{"name":"Shihua Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403390400"},{"name":"Jinhu Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RoyalMelbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinhu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278641900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"6353228","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2087},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Topology","Multiagent systems","Convergence","Switches","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","nonlinear systems","protocols","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiagent systems","virtual leader","finite-time distributed tracking control problems","fixed topology","switching topology","continuous distributed tracking protocols","chattering phenomenon","nonLipschitz dynamical systems","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-time consensus","multi-agent systems","switching topology","tracking control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6419840/06353228.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215786","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6419840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time Distributed Tracking Control for Multi-Agent Systems With a Virtual Leader","abstract":"This paper aims at further investigating the finite-time distributed tracking control problems for multi-agent systems with a virtual leader under the conditions of fixed and switching topologies, respectively. Two continuous distributed tracking protocols are designed for tracking the virtual leader in finite time. Compared with the traditional distributed tracking protocols, the proposed distributed tracking protocols can reach consensus in finite time. In particular, to eliminate the chattering phenomenon occurred in non-Lipschitz dynamical systems, this paper introduces a saturation function to replace the original sign function in the proposed distributed tracking protocols. The improved protocols can guide all agents to track the virtual leader without chattering phenomenon in finite time for the same position.

The new CFR is structured similar to DPD and is implemented by introducing a steady-state offset into the DPD coefficients. The DPD and CFR coefficients are estimated using separate adaptive processes but applied to the transmission path in a common module. The DPD/CFR module provides the means to exploit margins in the transmitter performance, allowing the tradeoff between peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), error vector magnitude, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR). The proposed approach applies CFR to the predistorted signal instead of the input signal. This allows the envelope clipping module, which is typically present to protect the power amplifier (PA), to be removed, thereby avoiding divergence problems during the iterative closed-loop estimation of the DPD coefficients. Results show that post-CFR lowers the PAPR of the predistorted signal by 5 dB, which reduces the stress on the peaking transistor in a Doherty PA. The combined DPD/CFR reduces the ACPR of the transmitter by 21 dB compared with the unlinearized PA.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6414699/06353232.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Approach to Digital Predistortion and Crest Factor Reduction for the Linearization of an RF Power Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353232/","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Approach to Digital Predistortion and Crest Factor Reduction for the Linearization of an RF Power Amplifier","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13255461","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353232/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Approach to Digital Predistortion and Crest Factor Reduction for the Linearization of an RF Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tmtt-braithwaite-2222911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177796S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6414699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6414699","articleId":"6353232","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353233,"authors":[{"name":"Girdhari Chaudhary","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, IT Convergence Research Center, Chonbuk National University, Jeollabuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6414699/6353233/6353233-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Girdhari Chaudhary (S'10) received the B.E. degree from Nepal Engineering College, Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2004, and the M.Tech degree from Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India, in 2007, both in electronics and communication engineering.

The newly proposed dual-band filter principally comprises two dual-mode single band filters using common input/output lines.

The proposed filter also offers switchable characteristics to select either of the passbands (either the first or the second passband only). To suppress the harmonics over a broad bandwidth, defected ground structures are used at input/output feeding lines without degrading the passbands characteristics. From the experimental results, it was found that the proposed filter exhibited the first passband center frequency tunable range from 1.48 to 1.8 GHz with a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) variation from 5.76% to 8.55% and the second passband center frequency tunable range from 2.40 to 2.88 GHz with the 3-dB FBW variation from 8.28% to 12.42%.

A capillary is passed through the center of the resonator so the sample occupies either maximum electric field (zero magnetic field) or maximum magnetic field (zero electric field) depending on whether an odd or even TEM mode is interrogated.

In this paper, we present a novel band-limited digital predistortion technique in which a band-limiting function is inserted into the general Volterra operators in the DPD model to control the signal bandwidth under modeling, which logically transforms the general Volterra series-based model into a band-limited version. This new approach eliminates the system bandwidth constraints of the conventional DPD techniques, and it allows users to arbitrarily choose the bandwidth to be linearized in the PA output according to the system requirement without sacrificing performance, which makes the DPD system design much more flexible and feasible. In order to validate this idea, a high-power LDMOS Doherty PA excited by various wideband signals, including 100-MHz long-term evolution advanced signals, was tested. Experimental results showed that excellent linearization performance can be obtained by employing the proposed approach. Furthermore, this technique can be applied to other linear-in-parameter models. In future ultra-wideband systems, this new technique can significantly improve system performance and reduce DPD implementation cost.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6384897/06353238.pdf","startPage":"4198","endPage":"4208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Band-Limited Volterra Series-Based Digital Predistortion for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Band-Limited Volterra Series-Based Digital Predistortion for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","volume":"60","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353238/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13187899","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353238/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Band-Limited Volterra Series-Based Digital Predistortion for Wideband RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yu-2222658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108719S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6384897","articleId":"6353238","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353239,"authors":[{"name":"Kyunghan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6497526/6353239/6353239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyunghan Lee (S'07\u2013A'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2002, 2004, and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, Korea.

We recruited 97 iPhone users from metropolitan areas and collected statistics on their WiFi connectivity during a two-and-a-half-week period in February 2010. Our trace-driven simulation using the acquired whole-day traces indicates that WiFi already offloads about 65% of the total mobile data traffic and saves 55% of battery power without using any delayed transmission. If data transfers can be delayed with some deadline until users enter a WiFi zone, substantial gains can be achieved only when the deadline is fairly larger than tens of minutes. With 100-s delays, the achievable gain is less than only 2%-3%, whereas with 1 h or longer deadlines, traffic and energy saving gains increase beyond 29% and 20%, respectively. These results are in contrast to the substantial gain (20%-33%) reported by the existing work even for 100-s delayed transmission using traces taken from transit buses or war-driving. In addition, a distribution model-based simulator and a theoretical framework that enable analytical studies of the average performance of offloading are proposed. These tools are useful for network providers to obtain a rough estimate on the average performance of offloading for a given WiFi deployment condition.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2218122","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6497526/06353239.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2218122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Data Offloading: How Much Can WiFi Deliver?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Data Offloading: How Much Can WiFi Deliver?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353239/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13431079","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353239/","volume":"21","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Data Offloading: How Much Can WiFi Deliver?","sourcePdf":"tnet-lee-2218122-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113771S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6497526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"407","xplore-issue":"6497526","articleId":"6353239","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6353241,"authors":[{"name":"Paras Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Industrial, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6504806/6353241/6353241-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paras Mandal (M'06\u2013SM'12) received the M.E. and B.E. degrees from Thailand and India, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of the Ryukyus, Japan, in 2005.","He is presently an Assistant Professor of Systems Engineering Program at the Department of Industrial, Manufacturing and Systems Engineering, University of Texas at El Paso.

This evolution is likely to be accompanied by a parallel evolution of the electricity supply business with the deployment of smart grid technologies. As a consequence, it is expected that demand will feature higher potential for communication and control, which will enable its active participation in the daily operational planning of power systems. In particular, EVs being equipped with a battery can both defer their demand or inject electricity back into the system. However, to achieve volumes that can have an impact on the system, these demands need to be aggregated and operated as an ensemble. This paper proposes the necessary adaptations to include the input of EV aggregation to electricity markets. This permits the scheduling of EV charging and services in coordination with the system operator thus enhancing the power system's efficiency and security while reducing its environmental impact. Results show that the EVs penetration levels that the system would be able to absorb without requiring expansion of the supply side, are significantly increased when coordination over their charging schedule is performed.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2221750","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2221750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06353242.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Vehicle Aggregator/System Operator Coordination for Charging Scheduling and Services Procurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353242/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electric Vehicle Aggregator/System Operator Coordination for Charging Scheduling and Services Procurement","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6353242/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13969305","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Vehicle Aggregator/System Operator Coordination for Charging Scheduling and Services Procurement","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ortegavazquez-2221750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095607S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6353242","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6353245,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Do Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6392980/6353245/6353245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Do Kim (S\u201908) was born in Korea, in 1983.

However, the hold-up-time requirement limits its operating duty ratio at normal operation. It results in conduction loss caused by circulating current. Therefore, a wide-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) PSFB converter with reduced conduction loss caused by circulating current is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter adopts the large resonant inductance and replaces clamp diodes in the conventional PSFB converter with MOSFET switches. With these modifications, the proposed converter can achieve the ZVS operation over wide load range as well as can reduce the conduction loss caused by the circulating current. These advantages result in the improvement of whole load efficiency. The operational principle and analysis of the proposed converter are presented and verified by the 1.2-kW prototype.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06353245.pdf","startPage":"3308","endPage":"3316","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-Range ZVS Phase-Shift Full-Bridge Converter With Reduced Conduction Loss Caused by Circulating Current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Range ZVS Phase-Shift Full-Bridge Converter With Reduced Conduction Loss Caused by Circulating Current","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6353245/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191087","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Range ZVS Phase-Shift Full-Bridge Converter With Reduced Conduction Loss Caused by Circulating Current","sourcePdf":"tpel-moon-2227280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084373S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6353245","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6353246,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The model is based on passive components and takes into account the real and reactive lamp power. The presented model and its obtention methodology will be an important tool for ballast designers. One of the most important features of the proposed methodology is the concern regarding core losses and lamp reactive characteristics, because nowadays there are no electric models including these characteristics. In order to obtain and validate the electrodeless lamp model, a series-parallel resonant half-bridge inverter is used as ballast. Plasma and lamp windings are modeled as resistances and reactances depending on the lamp power. Simulations employing the proposed model are also presented, showing an excellent agreement with experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06353246.pdf","startPage":"3603","endPage":"3613","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Equivalent Model for Induction Electrodeless Fluorescent Lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Electric Equivalent Model for Induction Electrodeless Fluorescent Lamps","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6353246/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191088","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Equivalent Model for Induction Electrodeless Fluorescent Lamps","sourcePdf":"tpel-prado-2227501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099266S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6353246","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353249,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Wan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6392980/6353249/6353249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng Wan (S\u201912) was born in Xiaogan City, Hubei Province, China, in 1987.

The control of the VSC is normally achieved by an outer voltage feedback loop and a sinusoidal pulsewidth-modulated inner current loop. However, the nonideal power grid and the presence of other interacting loads give rise to nonlinear operation and drive the VSC to enter an irreversible instability region. In this paper, an irreversible bifurcation phenomenon in a three-phase VSC connected to a power grid with an interacting load is reported. The converter can also be regarded as exhibiting a catastrophic bifurcation in which the input current expands to impose undesirable component stress. A large-signal analysis is adopted to identify the physical origin of the phenomenon and to locate the boundary of the instability. Experimental results on a 4-kVA ac/dc converter prototype provide verification of the instability phenomenon.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13191089","htmlLink":"/document/6353249/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Behavior and Instability in a Three-Phase Boost Rectifier Connected to a Nonideal Power Grid With an Interacting Load","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Behavior and Instability in a Three-Phase Boost Rectifier Connected to a Nonideal Power Grid With an Interacting Load","sourcePdf":"tpel-wan-2227505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082979S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6353249","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353257,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Dai","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6594872/6353257/6353257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shanshan Dai received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Boston University, Boston, MA, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering.","Her current research interests include design and modeling of low-power analog circuits, and mixed signal integrated circuits design."]},"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Dai","id":"37073854900"},{"name":"Xiaofei Cao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6594872/6353257/6353257-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaofei Cao received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the M.Sc. degree in low-power sigma-delta ADCs."]},"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Cao","id":"37073882600"},{"name":"Ting Yi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6594872/6353257/6353257-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Ting Yi received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.","She has been with Fudan University since 1996.

The proposed method is applicable to higher order modulation schemes, where the detector is sensitive to the estimation error. A doubly selective fast-fading channel is estimated using a fixed-lag Kalman filter (KF). The Kalman filtering is followed by a zero-phase low-pass filter, functioning as a smoother. A method for designing the smoother is introduced. Block processing is utilized to reduce the transient effects of the zero-phase filter (ZPF) at the edges of the symbol blocks. A first-order autoregressive (AR) model is fitted to the channel variations. For the case of 64-quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), a complex-exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) is exploited to capture the varying gains, and an AR(1) process is used to model the time evolution of the BEM coefficients. By virtue of the long memory of the smoother, the error-rate floor, which is commonly associated with low-order channel estimation models, is avoided. The potential for parallelism makes our approach well suited to multicore field implementations. The applicability of the method to 4-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM schemes is shown through simulation experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6353258/","accessionNumber":"13307185","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Fast-Fading Channels for Turbo Receivers With High-Order Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Fast-Fading Channels for Turbo Receivers With High-Order Modulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-movahedian-2227345-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095756S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6353258","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6353259,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Pan","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Pan","id":"37546684200"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310448100"},{"name":"Yuquan Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuquan","lastName":"Sun","id":"38239346900"},{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science,, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6353259","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Receiving antennas","Approximation methods","Multiaccess communication","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic spectral efficiency","uplink MIMO-CDMA systems","Rayleigh fading channels","arbitrary spatial correlation","multiple input multiple output direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","flat-fading channels","arbitrary correlation","system-channel-related matrix","block random matrix","operator-valued free probability","asymptotic eigenvalue distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","eigenvalue distribution","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","operator-valued free probability","spatial correlation","spectral efficiency (SE)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the asymptotic spectral efficiency (ASE) of the uplink multiple-input-multiple-output direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MIMO-CDMA) systems supporting multiple users, when assuming communications over flat-fading channels with arbitrary correlation in the spatial domain.

The algorithm is based on the auxiliary differential equation and the general polarization formulation. In anisotropic materials, electric fields are coupled and elements in the permittivity tensor are, in general, multiterm dispersive. The presented algorithm resolves the field coupling using a formulation based on electric polarizations. It also offers a simple procedure for the treatment of multiterm dispersion in the FDTD scheme.

The proposed model defines contextual state transitions from the joint configuration of the children to the parent nodes. We argue that the bottom-up context postulates different probabilistic assumptions with respect to a top-down approach, leading to different representational capabilities. We discuss classes of applications that are best suited to a bottom-up approach. In particular, the bottom-up context is shown to better correlate and model the co-occurrence of substructures among the child subtrees of internal nodes. A mixed memory approximation is introduced to factorize the joint children-to-parent state transition matrix as a mixture of pairwise transitions. The proposed approach is the first practical bottom-up generative model for tree-structured data that maintains the same computational class of its top-down counterpart. Comparative experimental analyses exploiting synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model can deal with deep structures better than a top-down generative model. The model is also shown to better capture structural information from real-world data comprising trees with a large out-degree. The proposed bottom-up model can be used as a fundamental building block for the development of other new powerful models.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2222044","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6357285/06353263.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"2002","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2222044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compositional Generative Mapping for Tree-Structured Data\u2014Part I: Bottom-Up Probabilistic Modeling of Trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compositional Generative Mapping for Tree-Structured Data\u2014Part I: Bottom-Up Probabilistic Modeling of Trees","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146482","pubMedId":"24808152","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353263/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compositional Generative Mapping for Tree-Structured Data\u2014Part I: Bottom-Up Probabilistic Modeling of Trees","sourcePdf":"tnnls-bacciu-2222044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115797S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6357285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6357285","articleId":"6353263","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353391,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353391/6353391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Gao (S'10) received his B.S. degree in Information Engineering and Ph.D. degree in Signal and Information Processing from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in July 2007 and July 2012, respectively.

This paper proposes novel Max-Min optimization based relay antenna selection (RAS) schemes for zero-forcing (ZF) based MIMO-PNC transmission. RAS relaxes ZF's constraints on the number of antennas and extends the applications of ZF based MIMO-PNC to more practical scenarios, where the dedicated relay has more antennas than the end node. Moreover, RAS also brings diversity advantages to TWRN and the achievable diversity gains of the proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed. In particular, an equivalence relation is carefully built for the diversity gains obtained by 1) RAS for ZF based MIMO-PNC and 2) transmit antenna selection (TAS) for MIMO broadcasting (BC) with ZF receivers. This equivalence transforms the original problem to a more tractable form which eventually allows explicit analytical results. It is interesting to see that Max-Min RAS keeps the network diversity gain of ZF based MIMO-PNC to be the same as the diversity gain of the point-to-point link within the TWRN. This insight extends the understanding on the behaviors of ZF transceivers with antenna selection (AS) to relatively complicated MIMO-TWRN/BC scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Forcing Based MIMO Two-Way Relay with Relay Antenna Selection: Transmission Scheme and Diversity Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.112281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353391.pdf","startPage":"4426","endPage":"4437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.112281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Forcing Based MIMO Two-Way Relay with Relay Antenna Selection: Transmission Scheme and Diversity Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6353391/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13196611","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Forcing Based MIMO Two-Way Relay with Relay Antenna Selection: Transmission Scheme and Diversity Analysis","sourcePdf":"4426-tw1212-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1707S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353391","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353392,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics, University of Patras, Greece","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353392/6353392-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Krikidis (S'03-M'07) was born in Athens, Greece, in 1977.

The investigated approach introduces a block-by-block transmission and requires data codewords that span several independent realizations of channel fading. This fundamental approach ensures a diversity gain at least equal to one (i.e., it does not suffer from error floors) and is employed to different relaying strategies without loop interference cancellation (LIC) and with imperfect LIC: a) Amplify-and-Forward (AF) without LIC, b) AF with imperfect LIC and c) Decode-and-Forward with imperfect LIC. The proposed protocols are analyzed from a diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) standpoint and practical universal codes that achieve the DMT of the proposed schemes are also presented. We show that AF without LIC ensures a full time diversity independently on the statistics of the loop interference, and it is introduced as a general FD-based relaying scheme. In addition, we demonstrate that imperfect LIC is not efficient for cases with strong residual loop interference and limits the diversity gain to one.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.120254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353392.pdf","startPage":"4524","endPage":"4535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.120254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying over Block Fading Channel: A Diversity Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353392/","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying over Block Fading Channel: A Diversity Perspective","volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188236","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353392/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex Relaying over Block Fading Channel: A Diversity Perspective","sourcePdf":"4524-tw1212-krikidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078973S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353392","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353394,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Reza Feyzmahdavian","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353394/6353394-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Reza Feyzmahdavian received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering with specialization in automatic control from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

While powerful and versatile, the framework has some drawbacks: the existence of fixed-points has to be established separately, and no guarantees are given on the rate of convergence of the iterates. This paper introduces contractive interference functions, a slight reformulation of the standard interference functions that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed-points along with linear convergence of iterates. We show that many power control laws from the literature are contractive and derive, sometimes for the first time, analytical convergence rate estimates for these algorithms. We also prove that contractive interference functions converge when executed totally asynchronously and, under the assumption that the communication delay is bounded, derive an explicit bound on the convergence time penalty due to increased delay. Finally, we demonstrate that although standard interference functions are, in general, not contractive, they are all para-contractions with respect to a certain metric. Similar results for two-sided scalable interference functions are also derived.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353394.pdf","startPage":"4494","endPage":"4502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102512.120101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102512.120101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contractive Interference Functions and Rates of Convergence of Distributed Power Control Laws","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Convergence","Standards","Vectors","Power control","Scalability","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","estimation theory","interference suppression","power control","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contractive interference functions","convergence rates","distributed power control laws","standard interference functions","fixed-points","linear convergence","analytical convergence rate estimates","communication delay","explicit bound","convergence time penalty","scalable interference functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference function","power control","wireless networks","contraction mapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Contractive Interference Functions and Rates of Convergence of Distributed Power Control Laws","volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6353394/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188238","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contractive Interference Functions and Rates of Convergence of Distributed Power Control Laws","sourcePdf":"4494-tw1212-feyma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090144S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353394","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353395,"authors":[{"name":"Tianbin Wo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353395/6353395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianbin Wo received his B.E. degree from Beijing Information Technology Institute, P.R.

Our characterization of the average cancellation as a function of the self-interference power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any active cancellation is applied), the rate of a full-duplex link increases as the self-interference power increases. Second, we show that applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the self-interference, and thus digital cancellation is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values. Third, we complete our study of the impact of self-interference cancellation mechanisms by characterizing the probability distribution of the self-interference channel before and after cancellation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353396.pdf","startPage":"4296","endPage":"4307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiment-Driven Characterization of Full-Duplex Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","xploreNote":"Award-Winning ComSoc Journal Papers","displayDocTitle":"Experiment-Driven Characterization of Full-Duplex Wireless Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353396/","publicationDate":"December 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13188240","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353396/","volume":"11","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiment-Driven Characterization of Full-Duplex Wireless Systems","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"4296-tw1212-duarte.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096028S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"985","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353396","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6353397,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Khirallah","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353397/6353397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chadi Khirallah received Ph.D. degree in advanced mobile communication systems from the University of Lancaster, U.K, in 2006.

The evolved LTE-A RAN offers rich environment for multi-point and multi-hop cooperation and coordination resulting in increased capacity and more predictable channel conditions between heterogeneous base stations and end users. While these opportunities are recently well investigated at the physical layer through various cooperative multi-point (CoMP) schemes, upper layer protocols preserve the design proposed for macro-cellular single-hop data delivery. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing and investigating in detail a cooperative RAN-wide MAC layer protocol based on random network coding (RNC) that is designed specifically for reliable and flexible data delivery over the evolved LTE-A RAN. The proposed RNC-based MAC protocol (MAC-RNC) is evaluated and compared with the existing HARQ-based (MAC-HARQ) protocol in various LTE-A RAN layouts using a customized packet-based link-level simulator based on Finite-State Markov Chain (FSMC) channel models. Our results show that the MAC-RNC protocol introduces simplicity and flexibility required for future LTE-A RANs, while preserving or improving the performance of the MAC-HARQ protocol in traditional single-point single-hop macro-cellular scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353397.pdf","startPage":"4275","endPage":"4285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Energy Efficiency of Random Network Coding in LTE-Advanced","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353397/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Energy Efficiency of Random Network Coding in LTE-Advanced","volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188241","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353397/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Energy Efficiency of Random Network Coding in LTE-Advanced","sourcePdf":"4275-tw1212-khira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10324S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353397","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353399,"authors":[{"name":"Biling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Network Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6353399/6353399-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Biling Zhang (M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

However, due to the selfish nature, secondary users may not act as cooperatively as primary users have expected. Therefore, how to stimulate the secondary users to play cooperatively is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based spectrum access framework, where the cooperation stimulation problem is modeled as an indirect reciprocity game. In the proposed game, secondary users choose how to help primary users relay information and gain reputations, based on which they can access a certain amount of vacant licensed channels in the future. By formulating a secondary user's decision making as a Markov decision process, we obtain the optimal action rule, according to which the secondary user will use maximal power to help primary user relay data if the channel is not in an outage, and thus greatly improve the primary user's quality of service as well as the spectrum utilization efficiency. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of stationary reputation distribution and theoretically derive the condition under which the optimal action rule is evolutionarily stable. Finally, simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111844","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06353399.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"4328","endPage":"4341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Indirect-Reciprocity Reputation Game for Cooperation in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Indirect-Reciprocity Reputation Game for Cooperation in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353399/","volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6353399/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188243","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Indirect-Reciprocity Reputation Game for Cooperation in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"4328-tw1212-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098452S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6353399","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353401,"authors":[{"name":"Mahshad Eslamifar","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mahshad","lastName":"Eslamifar","id":"37680143100"},{"name":"Woon Hau Chin","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Woon Hau","lastName":"Chin","id":"37331357200"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6353401","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":729},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Downlink","Antennas","Network coding","Error probability","Vectors","Bidirectional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","binary codes","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","error statistics","minimax techniques","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","two-step bidirectional relaying","multiple antennas","decode-and-forward multi-antenna relay systems","bidirectional communication","time slots","downlink broadcast schemes","analog network coding","diversity order","symbol error probability","downlink channel state information","maximal-ratio transmit beamforming","information vectors","max-min antenna selection","binary network coding scheme","partial channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relaying","bidirectional relay","physical network coding","binary network coding","antenna selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353401","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.102612.111482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","abstract":"In this paper we study decode-and-forward multi-antenna relay systems that achieve bi-directional communication in two time slots.

It is shown that if exact downlink channel state information is available at the relay, using analog network coding in the form of multi-antenna maximal-ratio transmit beamforming to precode the information vectors at the relay gives the best performance.

We show clearly that negative pre-chirped signals can be obtained by adjusting both modulator and amplifier driving parameters. Negative chirp operation is evaluated through small-signal chirp measurement as well as through time-resolved dynamic chirp measurement. Signal chirp control at emission enhances transmission and increases optical reach. Thanks to the SOA gain and chirp compensation for modulator loss and chirp, dispersion-penalty-free with clear open eye diagrams over 100 km of optical fiber at 10.3 Gb/s is achieved.

It largely determines the accuracy of tracking surgical tools. So we design an NIOTS and propose the corresponding algorithms to make it work well. Two near infrared cameras (NICs) are constructed in this NIOTS and a near infrared calibration board is designed to calibrate them. The NIOTS is then calibrated using the calibration results of NICs. After the image points of markers on surgical tools are obtained, a two-step stereo matching algorithm is proposed to match the subpixel points in the left and right images. Then the three dimensional coordinates of markers are computed and the surgical tools are tracked in real time. The experimental results show the accuracy of system calibration, stereo matching, and tracking. The average tracking errors of three markers in 150 positions are 0.0090 mm, 0.0071 mm, and 0.0060 mm, which demonstrate the designed NIOTS can accurately track surgical

orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM) technology, flexible online service provisioning can be realized with dynamic routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment (RMSA). In this paper, we propose several online service provisioning algorithms that incorporate dynamic RMSA with a hybrid single-/multi-path routing (HSMR) scheme. We investigate two types of HSMR schemes, namely HSMR using online path computation (HSMR-OPC) and HSMR using fixed path sets (HSMR-FPS). Moreover, for HSMR-FPS, we analyze several path selection policies to optimize the design. We evaluate the proposed algorithms with numerical simulations using a Poisson traffic model and two mesh network topologies. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed HSMR schemes can effectively reduce the bandwidth blocking probability (BBP) of dynamic RMSA, as compared to two benchmark algorithms that use single-path routing and split spectrum. Our simulation results suggest that HSMR-OPC can achieve the lowest BBP among all HSMR schemes. This is attributed to the fact that HSMR-OPC optimizes routing paths for each request on the fly with considerations of both bandwidth utilizations and lengths of links. Our simulation results also indicate that the HSMR-FPS scheme that use the largest slots-over-square-of-hops first path-selection policy obtains the lowest BBP among all HSMR-FPS schemes. We then investigate the proposed algorithms' impacts on other network performance metrics, including network throughput and network bandwidth fragmentation ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider dynamic RMSA based on both online path computation and offline path computation with various path selection policies for multipath provisioning in O-OFDM networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2227683","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6387606/06353490.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2227683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387606","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Service Provisioning in Elastic Optical Networks With Hybrid Single-/Multi-Path Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Service Provisioning in Elastic Optical Networks With Hybrid Single-/Multi-Path Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13188011","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353490/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Service Provisioning in Elastic Optical Networks With Hybrid Single-/Multi-Path Routing","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhu-2227683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111991S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6387606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"287","xplore-issue":"6387606","articleId":"6353490","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6353491,"authors":[{"name":"Albert E.

The proposed method aims at adapting the supervised classifier trained on a given RS source image to make it suitable for classifying a different but related target image. The two images can be acquired in different locations and/or at different times. The proposed approach iteratively selects the most informative samples of the target image to be labeled by the user and included in the training set, whereas the source image samples are reweighted or possibly removed from the training set on the basis of their disagreement with the target image classification problem. This way, the consistent information available from the source image can be effectively exploited for the classification of the target image and for guiding the selection of new samples to be labeled, whereas the inconsistent information is automatically detected and removed. This approach can significantly reduce the number of new labeled samples to be collected from the target image. Experimental results on both a multispectral very high resolution and a hyperspectral data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2220516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6365805/06353512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2220516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6365805","startPage":"736","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Domain Adaptation for the Classification of Remote Sensing Images Using Active Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Domain Adaptation for the Classification of Remote Sensing Images Using Active Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13150427","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353512/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Domain Adaptation for the Classification of Remote Sensing Images Using Active Learning","sourcePdf":"lgrs-persello-2220516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076499S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6365805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6365805","articleId":"6353512","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353513,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant P.

Current state-of-the-art \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d no reference (NR) IQA algorithms require knowledge about anticipated distortions in the form of training examples and corresponding human opinion scores. However we have recently derived a blind IQA model that only makes use of measurable deviations from statistical regularities observed in natural images, without training on human-rated distorted images, and, indeed without any exposure to distorted images. Thus, it is \u201ccompletely blind.\u201d The new IQA model, which we call the Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) is based on the construction of a \u201cquality aware\u201d collection of statistical features based on a simple and successful space domain natural scene statistic (NSS) model.

However, in most works these two techniques are adopted separately. In this letter, we propose a joint cooperative beamforming and jamming scheme to enhance the security of a cooperative relay network, where a part of intermediate nodes adopt distributed beamforming while others jam the eavesdropper, simultaneously. Since the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper may not be known, we propose a cooperative artificial noise transmission based secrecy strategy, subjected to the individual power constraint of each node. The beamformer weights and power allocation can be obtained by solving a second-order convex cone programming (SOCP) together with a linear programming problem. Simulations show the joint scheme greatly improves the security.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2227725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2227725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6353967/06353524.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Cooperative Beamforming and Jamming to Secure AF Relay Systems With Individual Power Constraint and No Eavesdropper's CSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Cooperative Beamforming and Jamming to Secure AF Relay Systems With Individual Power Constraint and No Eavesdropper's CSI","volume":"20","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353524/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13136175","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353524/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Cooperative Beamforming and Jamming to Secure AF Relay Systems With Individual Power Constraint and No Eavesdropper's CSI","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2227725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067472S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6353967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6353967","articleId":"6353524","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353527,"authors":[{"name":"Mats Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6471758/6353527/6353527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mats Gustafsson (M'05) received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetic theory from Lund University, Sweden, in 1994 and 2000, respectively.","In 2005, he was appointed was appointed Docent and, in 2011, Professor of electromagnetic theory at Lund University, Sweden.

These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2227735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2227735","startPage":"556","endPage":"566","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6399581/06353545.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Voice Conversion Based on Bilinear Frequency Warping Plus Amplitude Scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Voice Conversion Based on Bilinear Frequency Warping Plus Amplitude Scaling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353545/","accessionNumber":"13191302","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353545/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Voice Conversion Based on Bilinear Frequency Warping Plus Amplitude Scaling","sourcePdf":"tasl-erro-2227735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081062S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6399581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6399581","articleId":"6353545","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6353550,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6359939/6353550/6353550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Yu (M'97\u2013SM'06) joined Microsoft Corporation in 1998 and Microsoft Speech Research Group in 2002, where he is currently a senior researcher.

In addition, we describe an approach to map the tensor layers to the conventional sigmoid layers so that the former can be treated and trained in a similar way to the latter. With this mapping we can consider a DTNN as the DNN augmented with DP layers so that not only the BP learning algorithm of DTNNs can be cleanly derived but also new types of DTNNs can be more easily developed. Evaluation on Switchboard tasks indicates that DTNNs can outperform the already high-performing DNNs with 4-5% and 3% relative word error reduction, respectively, using 30-hr and 309-hr training sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13156846","htmlLink":"/document/6353550/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Deep Tensor Neural Network With Applications to Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Deep Tensor Neural Network With Applications to Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-yu-2227738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079924S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6359939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6359939","articleId":"6353550","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353551,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Xiong Zhang","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6399581/6353551/6353551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shi-Xiong Zhang (S'11) received a B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Jilin University in 2005 and an M.Phil. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2008.

This paper describes a particular model in this framework, structured support vector machines (SSVM), and how it can be applied to medium to large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. An important aspect of SSVMs is the form of the joint feature spaces. Here, context-dependent generative models, hidden Markov models, are used to obtain the features. To apply this form of combined generative and discriminative model to medium and larger vocabulary tasks, a number of issues need to be addressed. First, the features extracted are a function of the segmentation of the utterance. A Viterbi-like scheme for obtaining the \u201coptimal\u201d segmentation is described. Second, SSVMs can be viewed as large margin log linear models using a zero mean Gaussian prior of the discriminative parameter. However this form of prior is not appropriate for all features. A modified training algorithm is proposed that allows general Gaussian priors to be incorporated into the large margin criterion. Finally to speed up the training process, a 1-slack algorithm, caching competing hypotheses and parallelization strategies are also described. The performance of SSVMs is evaluated on small and medium to large speech recognition tasks: AURORA 2 and 4.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13191306","htmlLink":"/document/6353551/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Structured SVMs for Automatic Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured SVMs for Automatic Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-zhang-2227734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11949S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6399581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6399581","articleId":"6353551","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353553,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["Pearson Knowledge Technologies, Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6399581/6353553/6353553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Chen (S'09) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2006, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Missouri, Columbia, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Detection of such nodules by a CADe scheme is very important, because radiologists are likely to miss such subtle nodules. Our purpose in this study was to develop a CADe scheme with improved sensitivity and specificity by use of \u201cvirtual dual-energy\u201d (VDE) CXRs where ribs and clavicles are suppressed with massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs). To reduce rib-induced FPs and detect nodules overlapping with ribs, we incorporated the VDE technology in our CADe scheme. The VDE technology suppressed rib and clavicle opacities in CXRs while maintaining soft-tissue opacity by use of the MTANN technique that had been trained with real dual-energy imaging. Our scheme detected nodule candidates on VDE images by use of a morphologic filtering technique. Sixty morphologic and gray-level-based features were extracted from each candidate from both original and VDE CXRs. A nonlinear support vector classifier was employed for classification of the nodule candidates. A publicly available database containing 140 nodules in 140 CXRs and 93 normal CXRs was used for testing our CADe scheme. All nodules were confirmed by computed tomography examinations, and the average size of the nodules was 17.8 mm. Thirty percent (42/140) of the nodules were rated \u201cextremely subtle\u201d or \u201cvery subtle\u201d by a radiologist. The original scheme without VDE technology achieved a sensitivity of 78.6% (110/140) with 5 (1165/233) FPs per image. By use of the VDE technology, more nodules overlapping with ribs or clavicles were detected and the sensitivity was improved substantially to 85.0% (119/140) at the same FP rate in a leave-one-out cross-validation test, whereas the FP rate was reduced to 2.5 (583/233) per image at the same sensitivity level as the original CADe scheme obtained (Difference between the specificities of the original and the VDE-based CADe schemes was statistically significant). In particular, the sensitivity of our VDE-based CADe scheme for subtle nodules (66.7% = 28/42) was statistically significantly higher than that of the original CADe scheme (57.1% = 24/42). Therefore, by use of VDE technology, the sensitivity and specificity of our CADe scheme for detection of nodules, especially subtle nodules, in CXRs were improved substantially.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2226583","startPage":"369","endPage":"378","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6413218/06353554.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2226583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computerized Detection of Lung Nodules by Means of \u201cVirtual Dual-Energy\u201d Radiography","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Ribs","Feature extraction","Bones","Image segmentation","Training","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","CAD","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","feature extraction","filtering theory","image classification","medical image processing","neural nets","sensitivity","statistical analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerized detection","lung nodules","virtual dual-energy radiography","computer-aided detection","CAD","chest radiographs","ribs","frequent false positives","sensitivity","massive-training artificial neural networks","ANN","clavicle opacities","soft-tissue opacity","morphologic filtering technique","gray-level-based feature extraction","nonlinear support vector classifier","image classification","computed tomography examinations","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chest radiography (CXR)","computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)","lung cancer","rib suppression","virtual dual energy (VDE)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Case-Control Studies","Databases, Factual","Humans","Lung","Lung Neoplasms","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Radiography, Thoracic","Ribs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353554/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Computerized Detection of Lung Nodules by Means of \u201cVirtual Dual-Energy\u201d Radiography","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6353554/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13234663","pubMedId":"23193306","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computerized Detection of Lung Nodules by Means of \u201cVirtual Dual-Energy\u201d Radiography","sourcePdf":"tbme-chen-2226583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073787S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6413218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6413218","articleId":"6353554","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353565,"authors":[{"name":"Giona Matasci","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6353555/6353565/6353565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giona Matasci (S'10) was born in Locarno, Switzerland, in 1985.

Along the inclusion of the pixels to the training set, the weights associated with these samples are iteratively updated using different criteria, depending on their origin (source or target image).

The great tsunami induced by the earthquake of March 11th, 2011, which occurred beneath the Pacific off the northeastern coast of Japan, is adopted as the study case using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar multitemporal PolSAR images. The polarimetric scattering mechanism changes were quantitatively examined with model-based decomposition. It is clear that the observed reduction in the double-bounce scattering was due to a change into odd-bounce scattering, since a number of buildings were completely washed away, leaving relatively a rough surface. Polarization orientation (PO) angles in built-up areas are also investigated. After the tsunami, PO angle distributions from damaged areas spread to a wider range and fluctuated more strongly than those from the before-tsunami period. Two polarimetric indicators are proposed for damage level discrimination at the city block scale. One is the ratio of the dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism observed after-tsunami to that observed before-tsunami, which can directly reflect the amount of destroyed ground-wall structures in built-up areas. The second indicator is the standard deviation of the PO angle differences, which is used to interpret the homogeneity reduction of PO angles. Experimental results from after- and before-tsunami comparisons validate the efficiency of these indexes, since the built-up areas with different damage levels can be well discriminated. In addition, comparisons between before-tsunami pairs further confirm the stability of the two polarimetric indexes over a long temporal duration. These interesting results also demonstrate the importance of full polarimetric information for natural disaster assessment.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2210050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6484138/06353568.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2210050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484138","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tsunami Damage Investigation of Built-Up Areas Using Multitemporal Spaceborne Full Polarimetric SAR Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tsunami Damage Investigation of Built-Up Areas Using Multitemporal Spaceborne Full Polarimetric SAR Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13396653","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6353568/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Tsunami Damage Investigation of Built-Up Areas Using Multitemporal Spaceborne Full Polarimetric SAR Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-chen-2210050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110048S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6484138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6484138","articleId":"6353568","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6353569,"authors":[{"name":"Corina V\u0103duva","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics and Information Technology, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6504776/6353569/6353569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Corina V\u0103duva received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics and telecommunications from the University Politehnica of Bucharest, UPB, Romania, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","In 2010, she held a 6-month internship at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, as a visiting Ph.D. student in the Remote Sensing Technology Institute.

Searching for relevant knowledge with a semantic meaning consists mostly in visual human inspection of the data, regardless of the application. The method presented in this paper is an innovation in the field of information retrieval. It aims to discover latent semantic classes containing pairs of objects characterized by a certain spatial positioning. A hierarchical structure is recommended for the image content. This approach is based on a method initially developed for topics discovery in text, applied this time to invariant descriptors of image region or objects configurations. First, invariant spatial signatures are computed for pairs of objects, based on a measure of their interaction, as attributes for describing spatial arrangements inside the scene. Spatial visual words are then defined through a simple classification, extracting new patterns of similar object configurations. Further, the scene is modeled according to these new patterns (spatial visual words) using the latent Dirichlet allocation model into a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. In the end, some statistics are done to achieve a better understanding of the spatial distributions inside the discovered semantic classes.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2219314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6504776/06353569.pdf","startPage":"2770","endPage":"2786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2219314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Spatial Analysis of Satellite Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353569/","displayDocTitle":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Spatial Analysis of Satellite Images","volume":"51","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353569/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Spatial Analysis of Satellite Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-vaduva-2219314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081459S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6504776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6504776","articleId":"6353569","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353574,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6493455/6353574/6353574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuefeng Chen received the Ph.D. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, 2004.","He is a Professor of mechanical engineering with Xi'an Jiaotong University.

In the noiseless case, we analyze four different types of nearest-neighbor communication and compare the extreme cases of high mobility, where a new Poisson process is drawn in each time slot, and no mobility, where only a single realization exists and nodes stay put forever. It turns out that the local delay behaves rather differently in the two cases. We also provide the low- and high-rate asymptotic behavior of the minimum achievable delay in each case. In the cases with noise, power control is essential to keep the delay finite, and randomized power control can drastically reduce the required (mean) power for finite local delay.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2227675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2227675","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06353585.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Local Delay in Poisson Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Local Delay in Poisson Networks","volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13307123","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6353585/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Local Delay in Poisson Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-haenggi-2227675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076737S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6461106","articleId":"6353585","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353590,"authors":[{"name":"Son Hoang Dau","affiliation":["SUTD-MIT International Design Centre, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore","Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Son Hoang Dau received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and informatics from the College of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2006.

In this study, a generalization of index coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is studied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are investigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the side information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of erroneous symbols \u03b4 , what is the shortest length of a linear index code, such that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This question turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a shortest length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting capability in the classical coding theory. The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the \u03b1-bound and the \u03ba -bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting index code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on concatenation of an optimal index code with a maximum distance separable classical code is shown to attain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction may not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another inexplicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC. Further, the problem of error-correcting decoding by a linear ECIC is studied. It is shown that in order to decode correctly the desired symbol, the decoder is required to find one of the vectors, belonging to an affine space containing the actual error vector. The syndrome decoding is shown to produce the correct output if the weight of the error pattern is less or equal to the error-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC. Finally, the notion of static ECIC, which is suitable for use with a family of instances of an index coding problem, is introduced. Several bounds on the length of static ECICs are derived, and constructions for static ECICs are discussed. Connections of these codes to weakly resilient Boolean functions are established.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Correction for Index Coding With Side Information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2227674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06353590.pdf","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2227674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Error Correction for Index Coding With Side Information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6353590/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13307128","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Correction for Index Coding With Side Information","sourcePdf":"tit-skachek-2227674-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120093S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6461106","articleId":"6353590","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353598,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6353598/6353598-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhou (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

However, existing mixed-signal CS front-end implementation schemes often suffer from high power consumption and nonlinearity. This paper presents a digital-assisted asynchronous compressive sensing (DACS) front-end which offers lower power and higher reconstruction performance relative to the conventional CS-based approaches. The front-end architecture leverages a continuous-time ternary encoding scheme which modulates amplitude variation to ternary timing information. Power is optimized by employing digital-assisted modules in the front-end circuit and a part-time operation strategy for high-power modules.

They are implemented using a 150-nm CMOS process technology, employ self-mixing in the n-channels of the transistors and operate well above the transistors' cutoff frequency. The theoretical description of device operation by Dyakonov and Shur is extended in order to describe the device impedance, responsivity, and noise-equivalent power for a novel detection concept, which couples the signal to the drain. This approach enables quasi-static (QS) detection and calibration of the detectors. The different transport regimes (i.e., QS, distributed resistive, and plasmonic mixing) and their transitions are theoretically discussed and experimentally accessed. Responsivity values of 350 V/W at 595 GHz, 30 V/W at 2.9 THz, and 5 V/W at 4.1 THz are reported. At 0.595 THz, we determine the optical noise equivalent power (NEP) to be 42 pW/\u221aHz ; at 2.9 THz, the value is 487 pW/\u221aHz. All values are reported for optimum gate bias with respect to NEP at 295 K. For 0.595 THz, theory predicts a NEP value at threshold as low as 2 pW/\u221aHz for ideal coupling of the radiation.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2221732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6384895/06353608.pdf","startPage":"3834","endPage":"3843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2221732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS Integrated Antenna-Coupled Field-Effect Transistors for the Detection of Radiation From 0.2 to 4.3 THz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Integrated Antenna-Coupled Field-Effect Transistors for the Detection of Radiation From 0.2 to 4.3 THz","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353608/","accessionNumber":"13187885","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Integrated Antenna-Coupled Field-Effect Transistors for the Detection of Radiation From 0.2 to 4.3 THz","sourcePdf":"tmtt-boppel-2221732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11667S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6384895","articleId":"6353608","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353609,"authors":[{"name":"Asmita Dani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6384897/6353609/6353609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Asmita Dani (S'011) received the B.Tech degree in electronics engineering from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India, in 2008, and the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2010, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in microwave circuits and system design.","Her research interests include linearization and efficiency enhancement of power amplifiers using external harmonics, monolithic microwave integrated circuit design and analysis of communication system transmitters and receivers."]},"firstName":"Asmita","lastName":"Dani","id":"38467835400"},{"name":"Michael Roberg","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6384897/6353609/6353609-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Roberg (S'09) received the B.S.E.E degree from Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA, in 2003, the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2012.","From 2003 to 2009, he was an Engineer with Lockheed MartinMS2, Moorestown, NJ, where he was involved with advanced phased-array radar systems.

An ultra-wideband impulse radar (UWB-IR)-based reader interrogates the chipless tag with a UWB pulse, and the received backscatter is analyzed in the time domain. The key components constituting the backscattered signal, the structural mode, and the antenna mode are identified, and their spectral content are analyzed. Analysis shows that the antenna mode backscatter contains the information carrying signal while the structural mode backscatter contains no information about the tag. A semi-analytical model is developed to explain the behavior of the signal backscattered from the chipless RFID tag. Simulation and semi-analytical results are validated by experimental measurements obtained in an anechoic chamber environment using a 4-b multipatch chipless RFID tag. The new method does not rely on calibration tags for operation and has a greater degree of freedom in the orientation of tags with respect to a reader. A novel method, selective spectral interrogation (SSI), that uses a set of interrogation pulses to extract information bits stored in the spectral signature of the chipless tag is also introduced.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6384897/06353612.pdf","startPage":"4187","endPage":"4197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Detection of Frequency-Spectra-Based Chipless RFID Using UWB Impulsed Interrogation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353612/","displayDocTitle":"On the Detection of Frequency-Spectra-Based Chipless RFID Using UWB Impulsed Interrogation","volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13187902","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353612/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Detection of Frequency-Spectra-Based Chipless RFID Using UWB Impulsed Interrogation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kalansuriya-2222920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090579S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6384897","articleId":"6353612","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353614,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Roberg","affiliation":["TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc., Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6384897/6353614/6353614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Roberg (S'09) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA, in 2003, the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2012.","From 2003 to 2009, he was an Engineer with Lockheed Martin\u2013MS2, Moorestown, NJ, where he was involved with advanced phased-array radar systems.

The theory is based on a Fourier analysis of current and voltage waveforms, which arise across the rectifying element when different harmonic terminations are presented at its terminals. An analogy to harmonically terminated power amplifier (PA) theory is discussed. From the analysis, one can obtain an optimal value for the dc load given the RF circuit design. An upper limit on rectifier efficiency is derived for each case as a function of the device on-resistance. Measured results from fundamental frequency source-pull measurement of a Schottky diode rectifier with short-circuit terminations at the second and third harmonics are presented. A maximal device rectification efficiency of 72.8% at 2.45 GHz matches the theoretical prediction.

To study the physical-layer characteristics of OSMR, we implement a prototype OSMR transmitter/receiver with GNU software defined radio and conduct experiments in a university building. Our results are positive and show that wireless channels allow OSMR for a significant percentage of the time. Motivated by our physical-layer study, we propose extensions to the 802.11 MAC protocol to support OSMR transmission, which is backward-compatible with existing 802.11 devices. We also note that the access point (AP) needs a packet scheduling algorithm to efficiently exploit OSMR. We show that the scheduling problem without considering the packet transmission overhead can be formalized as a linear programming problem, but the scheduling problem considering the overhead is NP-hard. We then propose a practical scheduler based on a two-phase algorithm that can also handle channel fluctuations. We test the proposed protocol and algorithm with simulations driven by traffic traces collected from wireless LANs and channel-state traces collected from our experiments, and the results show that OSMR significantly improves the downlink performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2222436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2222436","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6579648/06353617.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6579648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employing the One-Sender\u2013Multiple-Receiver Technique in Wireless LANs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Employing the One-Sender\u2013Multiple-Receiver Technique in Wireless LANs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353617/","accessionNumber":"13706153","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353617/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employing the One-Sender\u2013Multiple-Receiver Technique in Wireless LANs","sourcePdf":"tnet-zhang-2222436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077539S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6579648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6579648","articleId":"6353617","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353643,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Yaramasu","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6392980/6353643/6353643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Venkata Yaramasu (S\u201908) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2005, and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering with specialization in power electronics from the S.

Unlike classical control schemes, the proposed method does not require current PI controllers or a complex modulation stage. The discrete-time model of the inverter, filter, and load are used to predict the future behavior of the load currents for each of the 16 possible switching states. The control method chooses a switching state that minimizes the error between the output currents and their references. The performance of the proposed method has been investigated for perturbations in the filter and load parameters. The neutral-leg switching frequency reduction algorithm is also proposed to improve the efficiency of the converter. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified in this first part, through simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06353643.pdf","startPage":"3459","endPage":"3468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part I: Concept, Algorithm, and Simulation Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Switches","Load modeling","Cost function","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","electric current control","invertors","perturbation techniques","power convertors","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive current control strategy","four-leg inverters","simulation analysis","linear loads","nonlinear loads","balanced loads","unbalanced loads","discrete-time model","load currents","perturbations","filter parameters","load parameters","neutral-leg switching frequency reduction algorithm","converter efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control systems","current control","dc\u2013ac power conversion","digital control","discrete-time signals","distributed generation","finite control set (FCS) model predictive control (MPC)","four-leg converters","grid-connected","shunt active power filters (SAPFs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part I: Concept, Algorithm, and Simulation Analysis","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6353643/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191094","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part I: Concept, Algorithm, and Simulation Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpel-rivera-2227509-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088777S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6353643","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353648,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We review applications of magnetically driven implosions (MDIs) to inertial confinement fusion. Previous research on MDIs of wire-array z-pinches for radiation-driven indirect-drive target designs is summarized. Indirect-drive designs are compared with new targets that are imploded by direct application of magnetic pressure produced by the pulsed-power current pulse. We describe target design elements such as larger absorbed energy, magnetized and pre-heated fuel, and cryogenic fuel layers that may relax fusion requirements. These elements are embodied in the magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) concept [Slutz \u201cPulsed-power-driven cylindrical liner implosions of laser pre-heated fuel magnetized with an axial field,\u201d Phys. Plasmas, 17, 056303 (2010), and Stephen A. Slutz and Roger A. Vesey, \u201cHigh-Gain Magnetized Inertial Fusion,\u201d Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 025003 (2012)]. MagLIF is in the class of magneto-inertial fusion targets. In MagLIF, the large drive currents produce an azimuthal magnetic field that compresses cylindrical liners containing pre-heated and axially pre-magnetized fusion fuel. Scientific breakeven may be achievable on the Z facility with this concept. Simulations of MagLIF with deuterium-tritium fuel indicate that the fusion energy yield can exceed the energy invested in heating the fuel at a peak drive current of about 27 MA. Scientific breakeven does not require alpha particle self-heating and is therefore not equivalent to ignition. Capabilities to perform these experiments will be developed on Z starting in 2013. These simulations and predictions must be validated against a series of experiments over the next five years. Near-term experiments are planned at drive currents of 16 MA with D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n fuel. MagLIF increases the efficiency of coupling energy (=target absorbed energy/driver stored energy) to targets by 10-150\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i>\n relative to indirect-drive targets. MagLIF also increases the absolute energy absorbed by the target by 10-50\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i>\n relative to indirect-drive targets. These increases could lead to higher fusion gains and yields. Single-shot high yields are of great utility to national security missions. Higher efficiency and higher gains may also translate into more compelling (lower cost and complexity) fusion reactor designs. We will discuss the broad goals of the emerging research on the MagLIF concept and identify some of the challenges. We will also summarize advances in pulsed-power technology and pulsed-power driver architectures that double the efficiency of the driver.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2012.2223488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/6376194/06353648.pdf","startPage":"3222","endPage":"3245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2012.2223488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetically Driven Implosions for Inertial Confinement Fusion at Sandia National Laboratories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Magnetically Driven Implosions for Inertial Confinement Fusion at Sandia National Laboratories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353648/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13167732","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353648/","volume":"40","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Magnetically Driven Implosions for Inertial Confinement Fusion at Sandia National Laboratories","sourcePdf":"tps-cuneo-2223488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.617725S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"6376194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6376194","articleId":"6353648","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353653,"authors":[{"name":"Ankur Bansal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6353653/6353653-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ankur Bansal (S\u201911) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow, India, in 2007, and the M.Tech. degree in signal processing from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, in 2009.

The DF-based MIMO cooperative system considered in this paper utilizes orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) for the transmission of data of the source to the destination. To reduce the decoding complexity, a suboptimal piecewise linear (PL) decoder is also derived, which performs close to the ML decoder. The proposed ML and PL decoders are applicable to arbitrary complex-valued \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n -ary constellations and require the destination node to possess knowledge of the channel statistics of the source-relay (S-R) links, whereas the existing decoder of multi-antenna-based DF cooperative systems needs to know the exact channel coefficients of the S-R link at the destination. The proposed decoders outperform an amplify-and-forward (AF)-protocol-based multi-antenna cooperative system. We obtain an expression of the average probability of error of the proposed PL decoder using an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-phase-shift keying (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-PSK) constellation and a single MIMO relay.

However, in the increasingly complex wireless packet data networks of today, performance is affected by many different factors and cannot easily be estimated by simple radio measurements. Therefore, in 3GPP Release 11 specifications, MDT is enhanced in order to provide a more complete view of network performance. This article describes the MDT enhancements added in Release 11, explains how measurements collected by MDT can be used to draw conclusions that are relevant for network management, and discusses similarities and differences between MDT and traditional drive tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6353668/06353680.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of drive tests in 3GPP release 11","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio access networks","Throughput","Volume measurement","Time measurement","Quality of service","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","packet radio networks","subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drive tests minimization","3GPP release 11","3GPP release 10","assess network performance","OPEX","complex wireless packet data networks","MDT enhancements","network management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of drive tests in 3GPP release 11","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6353680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136134","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of drive tests in 3GPP release 11","sourcePdf":"012JOHANSSONLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033941S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6353668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6353668","articleId":"6353680","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353681,"authors":[{"name":"Juho Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Juho Lee (juh095.lee@samsung.com) received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 1993, 1995, and 2000, respectively.

It has been shown by the studies of 3GPP that for some specific frequency bands, concurrent operations of LTE and ISM/GNSS radios working in adjacent or sub-harmonic frequencies will result in significant in-device coexistence interference that cannot be completely eliminated by filter technology. This motivates 3GPP to introduce signaling mechanisms and procedures, which enable the devices to effectively solve the indevice coexistence problems with help from the LTE network.

This standard covers the terminal, radio, core network, and user service aspects.

This changing landscape of Internet access pricing is evidenced by the elimination of flat rate data plans in favor of usage-based pricing by major wired and wireless operators in the US and Europe. But simple usage-based fees suffer from the problem of imposing costs on all users, irrespective of the network congestion level at a given time. To effectively reduce network congestion, appropriate incentives must be provided to users who are willing to time-shift their data demand from peak to off-peak periods. These pricing incentives can either be static (e.g., two-period daytime/nighttime prices) or computed dynamically (e.g., dayahead pricing, real-time pricing). Data plans that offer such incentives to consumers fall under the category of time-dependent pricing (TDP). Many ISPs across the world are currently exploring various forms of TDP to manage their traffic growth. This article first outlines the sources of today\u00bfs challenges, and then discusses current trends from regulatory and technological perspectives. Finally, we review representative pricing proposals for incentivizing the time-shifting of data.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6353668/06353688.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353668","startPage":"91","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentivizing time-shifting of data: a survey of time-dependent pricing for internet access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incentivizing time-shifting of data: a survey of time-dependent pricing for internet access","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136141","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353688/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentivizing time-shifting of data: a survey of time-dependent pricing for internet access","sourcePdf":"020SENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065453S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6353668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6353668","articleId":"6353688","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6353690,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Zhang is currently working toward a Ph.D. degree at the School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Due to the flexibility of mechanism design, there are various auction mechanisms that have been applied to cognitive radio systems with different characteristics.

Then the motivations and specific design issues in applying auctions to wireless network architectures and protocols are discussed. Then we review the state of the art in the use of auction theory and mechanism design in cognitive radio networks.

Simply increasing capacity will not be sufficient; overall bandwidth utilization also needs to improve. A combination of improved transport capacity through increased spectral efficiency and bit rate along with better network utilization by integrating subchannel electrical grooming into the transmission system will be required. Smarter ways to utilize optical capacity are key since transmission costs have been decreasing slower than grooming and switching costs. Integrated transport and switching can improve the efficiency of the client network using techniques such as port virtualization and transit traffic reduction. The baseline for transport networks will be 100 Gb/s PM-QPSK using 50 GHz channel spacing. Moving from a fixed DWDM channel arrangement to support flexible grid and super channels will allow tighter channel (carrier) spacing and should increase capacity by 30 to 50 percent. For shorter distances higher-order modulation such as 16-QAM can double network capacity. To better optimize network efficiency, an architecture that flexibly combines lower rate (sub-100 Gb/s) clients to form channels (carriers) and then superchannels will be required.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6353668/06353698.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-capacity optical transport networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353698/","displayDocTitle":"High-capacity optical transport networks","volume":"50","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136149","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353698/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-capacity optical transport networks","sourcePdf":"030XIALAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041922S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6353668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6353668","articleId":"6353698","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6353703,"authors":[{"name":"Angel Lozano","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Angel Lozano (angel.lozano@upf.edu) is a Professor of Information and Communication Technologies at UPF (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) in Barcelona, Spain.

Other weaknesses have to do with changes in the operating conditions of wireless systems, and others with the coarse and asymptotic nature of some of the most popular performance metrics (\"diversity\" and \"multiplexing\").","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/6353668/06353703.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2012.6353703","startPage":"210","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Are yesterday-s information-theoretic fading models and performance metrics adequate for the analysis of today's wireless systems?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353703/","displayDocTitle":"Are yesterday-s information-theoretic fading models and performance metrics adequate for the analysis of today's wireless systems?","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353703/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"13136154","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Are yesterday-s information-theoretic fading models and performance metrics adequate for the analysis of today's wireless systems?","sourcePdf":"035LOZANOLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052066S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6353668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6353668","articleId":"6353703","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353717,"authors":[{"name":"Craig Hafer","affiliation":["Aeroflex Colorado Springs, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Hafer","id":"37268526500"},{"name":"Matt Von Thun","affiliation":["Aeroflex Colorado Springs, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Von Thun","id":"38233541700"},{"name":"Michelle Mundie","affiliation":["Aeroflex Colorado Springs, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Mundie","id":"38514379900"},{"name":"Derek Bass","affiliation":["Aeroflex Colorado Springs, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Bass","id":"37690662800"},{"name":"Fred Sievert","affiliation":["Aeroflex Colorado Springs, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Sievert","id":"37594527700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2732-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2730-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0535"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0519"}],"articleNumber":"6353717","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic fields","Radiation effects","Springs","Xenon","Single event upset","Magnetic tunneling","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardened MRAM device","SEU heavy ion test","SET heavy ion test","SEFI heavy ion test","SEL immunity","TID immunity","single event latchup","single event functional interrupt","single event transient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353717","abstract":"The SEU, SET, and SEFI heavy ion test results are presented for a 16Mbit MRAM device.

The two source nodes send their packets simultaneously over time-varying channels to a relay node, then the relay broadcasts the received superimposed packets to the source nodes using network coding. The nodes use trellis coding for the sake of error correction and multi-antenna equipments to combat multipath fading. A challenging multiple access problem occurs at the relay node, which performs joint channel estimation and decoding for the individual source packets. We design message passing algorithms based on factor-graphs to solve this problem. The relay has two separate modules that perform channel estimation and decoding for the packets received from each source node. The interference generated by the other source node is taken into account by exchanging messages between the two modules.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6565522/06353857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565522","startPage":"1455","endPage":"1468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Trellis-Coded MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Trellis-Coded MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13655720","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6353857/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Decoding for Trellis-Coded MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"1455jsac0813lehmann.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09799S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6565522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6565522","articleId":"6353857","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353871,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/6413192/6353871/6353871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ma Luo (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in physics from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2005.

We develop a domain decomposition method (DDM) to reduce computer memory and central processing unit (CPU) time requirements by combining the spectral element method (SEM) and the spectral integral method (SIM) for large-scale finite periodic structures. The interior scattering subdomains within each period are modeled by the SEM while the exterior scattering problem is modeled by the SIM. The interactions between neighboring subdomains are modeled by the frequency-domain version of the Riemann solver. Numerical convergence of the Riemann solver is fast and weakly dependent on the size of the system. Two sets of examples demonstrate the typical nanophotonic applications: The first periodic system is a vertical coupling waveguide based on a photonic crystal slab which opens a way to construct and simulate optical circuits. The second periodic system is a finite-sized metamaterial with an effective negative refractive index, whose edge effects are visualized and analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13234853","volume":"101","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6353871/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectral Methods and Domain Decomposition for Nanophotonic Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Methods and Domain Decomposition for Nanophotonic Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-liu-2218791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076632S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6413192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6413192","articleId":"6353871","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353877,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Fu Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6423230/6353877/6353877-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shang-Fu Yeh received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

Inspired by the amplitude discontinuity of channel impulse responses, we first develop an automatic cluster identification algorithm. A moving averaging ratio is extracted from measured responses, which thoroughly reflects prevailing amplitude ruptures induced by different clusters. Based on a novel wavelet scales multiplication, an efficient cluster extraction scheme is presented. Our scheme can automatically discover multiple clusters, which shows great promise in realistic measurement analysis. Subsequently, from a ray-optical and statistical point of view, a parametric model of inter-cluster shape is suggested, which interprets the observed inter-cluster power as a kind of large-scale frequency selectivity. Parameter fitting to real data validates this power delay profile (PDP) model. Finally, we apply the identified clusters and fitted PDP to the practical design of low-complexity ultra-wideband sensors, which is of particular interest to the emerging wireless sensor networks. By utilizing the cluster PDP as a roughly matched template for a received signal, detection performance can be noticeably reinforced. This method simultaneously provides a practical criterion to evaluate the clustered propagation modeling, and the remarkable receiving gain verifies the effectiveness of our suggested cluster identification scheme and PDP model.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2227997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2227997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6451196/06353879.pdf","startPage":"1288","endPage":"1300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization on Clustered Propagations of UWB Sensors in Vehicle Cabin: Measurement, Modeling and Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Characterization on Clustered Propagations of UWB Sensors in Vehicle Cabin: Measurement, Modeling and Evaluation","volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13306515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353879/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization on Clustered Propagations of UWB Sensors in Vehicle Cabin: Measurement, Modeling and Evaluation","sourcePdf":"jsen-li-2227997-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110665S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6451196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6451196","articleId":"6353879","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6353891,"authors":[{"name":"Olutola Jonah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Olutola","lastName":"Jonah","id":"37947785500"},{"name":"Stavros V.

Due to the diversity and complexity of fore-/background, recognition using pixel-based methods usually does not perform well. In this letter, we propose a new method integrating the high-level information of a shape prior, which is considered as a coarse-to-fine process. In the coarse stage, the pose of an aircraft is roughly estimated by a single template matching with a defined score criterion. In the fine stage, we derive a parametric shape model by applying principal component analysis and kernel density function, which have good effects on both dimension reduction and sample space description; then, a new variational formulation combining region information and a shape prior is proposed to segment the object using a level set method. Finally, the parameters of the segmentation result are directly applied to verify aircraft type with two \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-nearest neighbor steps. Experiments on QuickBird images demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2214022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6361358/06353895.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2214022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aircraft Recognition in High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Coarse-to-Fine Shape Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353895/","displayDocTitle":"Aircraft Recognition in High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Coarse-to-Fine Shape Prior","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146599","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aircraft Recognition in High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Coarse-to-Fine Shape Prior","sourcePdf":"lgrs-liu-2214022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045865S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6361358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"55","articleId":"6353895","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353907,"authors":[{"name":"Dipayan Das","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Dipayan Das (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2006.

The pixels in this CIS integrate the photocurrent in each pixel for a time that depends upon the photocurrent to map wide-dynamic-range (WDR) real-world scenes to a lower DR output. To improve their low-light sensitivity, these pixels include a MOSFET that restricts the voltage changes on the photodiode. In addition, the user-defined input voltage needed to generate a WDR response is one that preserves the low-light sensitivity of the pixels. This results in pixels with a linear response at low photocurrents and a logarithmic response at larger photocurrents. Results are presented, which show that a fixed-pattern-noise (FPN) correction procedure based upon assuming either a linear or a logarithmic response introduces artifacts into some images. An FPN correction procedure that both avoids these artifacts and accurately estimates the mean photocurrent in the array is then presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-Pattern-Noise Correction for an Integrating Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2012.2226589","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6387647/06353907.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2226589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-Pattern-Noise Correction for an Integrating Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6353907/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187733","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-Pattern-Noise Correction for an Integrating Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"ted-collins-2226589-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060276S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6387647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6387647","articleId":"6353907","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353910,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong-Jae Lee","affiliation":["DMC R&D Center, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon-si, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6387647/6353910/6353910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyeong-Jae Lee received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2011.","He is currently a Senior Engineer with the DMC R&D Center, Samsung Electronics."]},"firstName":"Kyeong-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407640400"},{"name":"Hyesung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6387647/6353910/6353910-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hyesung Park received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2012.","Since 2012, he has been a Postdoctoral Associate with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology."]},"firstName":"Hyesung","lastName":"Park","id":"37086643328"},{"name":"Jing Kong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6387647/6353910/6353910-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Kong received the Ph.D. degree in chemistry from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2002.","In 2004, she joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, where she is currently ITT Career Development Associate Professor with the Department of EECS."]},"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Kong","id":"37308717900"},{"name":"Anantha P.

It has been checked that it behaves as a voltage source with high input impedance. Because of this feature, this topology is suitable for multiphase design, where different stages share the load in a passive way, without any extra mechanism or components. The design of multiphase converters is simplified, particularly for a big number of phases, as no extra information must be processed. Steady-state current sharing has been studied as well as how component tolerances affect the current distribution. A simple design guide to select different components has been detailed, and, moreover, the conditions to achieve soft switching have been revised. To test passive current sharing, a two-phase ACBC has been built. It has been tested in open loop to prove that without any control loop or extra components, the load sharing is achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2227896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06353913.pdf","startPage":"4947","endPage":"4959","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2227896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiphase ZVS Active Clamp Boost Converter: DC and Dynamic Current Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiphase ZVS Active Clamp Boost Converter: DC and Dynamic Current Sharing","volume":"60","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6353913/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563577","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiphase ZVS Active Clamp Boost Converter: DC and Dynamic Current Sharing","sourcePdf":"tie-dejodar-2227896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087458S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6353913","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6353916,"authors":[{"name":"Renquan Lu","affiliation":["Hangzhou Institute of Service Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China","Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6353916/6353916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renquan Lu (M\u203208) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.","He is currently a Full Professor with the Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou.

The outputs in these converters being coupled, cross-regulation among the outputs plays a major role in deciding the performance of the system. This paper proposes a control scheme that ensures good load and line regulation and stable system dynamics and reduces cross-regulation effect significantly. In designing a control scheme, proper analysis of the system is an important factor, and SIMO class of converters being driven by a ripple in the inductor current, conventional modeling does not hold good. Consequently, a ripple-based modeling approach that accurately judges the system performance is adopted. A cross-derivative state feedback control methodology has been proposed so as to completely decouple the outputs. Finally, a single-inductor dual-output SIMO converter has been built on a printed circuit board using discrete components, and the test results presented validate the modeling technique proposed. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control scheme significantly reduces cross-regulation at the outputs.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2227895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06353917.pdf","startPage":"5095","endPage":"5104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2227895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Scheme for Reduced Cross-Regulation in Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC\u2013DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Control Scheme for Reduced Cross-Regulation in Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC\u2013DC Converters","volume":"60","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563580","htmlLink":"/document/6353917/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Scheme for Reduced Cross-Regulation in Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-patra-2227895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16463S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6353917","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6353919,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power System, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6423965/6353919/6353919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kui Wang (M'11) was born in Hubei, China, in 1984.

The proposed PWM scheme not only takes advantage of the special properties available in NPC inverters, but also reduces the switching loss of the inverter along with an inherent neutral point (NP) voltage control. Based on a circuit-level decoupling concept, the NPC inverter can be decoupled into two three-level Buck converters in every defined operating section, and thereby the controller design can be simplified. The salient features of the proposed scheme, as compared with the existing carrier-based DPWM strategies, are: 1) its reduced computational processing time, 2) its capability to balance the dc-link voltage without any additional control, and 3) its reduced complexity, e.g., only one carrier wave needed for pulse width modulating. Same as a space-vector modulation, the maximum modulation index, 1.1547, can be attainable by the proposed scheme. Moreover, compared to conventional continuous sinusoidal PWM, using this technique proposed here, the switching losses of the devices can be reduced by one third. In order to explain the operation of this topology properly, the decoupling principle including the driving signal synthesis and the NP potential variation are analyzed in detail in this paper. Finally, the viability and performance of the proposed modulation scheme are shown through simulation and experimental results in a laboratory prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353921/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13287669","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuous PWM Modulation Strategy With Circuit-Level Decoupling Concept of Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped (NPC) Inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuous PWM Modulation Strategy With Circuit-Level Decoupling Concept of Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped (NPC) Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2227901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088736S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6423965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6423965","articleId":"6353921","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6353935,"authors":[{"name":"Hayato Omori","affiliation":["Department of Precision Mechanics, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6410053/6353935/6353935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hayato Omori (M'10) was born in Kanagawa, Japan, in 1985.

Our developed device consists of two units: a propulsion unit and an excavation unit. The propulsion unit that is based on the peristaltic crawling of earthworm maintains the body position and orientation of the robot and also reduces friction, which is the factor that traditionally prevents robots from excavating to significant depths. The excavation unit excavates and clears a space for the robot to tunnel into densely packed soil. In this paper, we discuss strategies for underground excavation. Next, we develop the excavation and propulsion units, and conduct several experiments to test these units. Finally, we develop a prototype subsurface robot with both units integrated in one package. The prototype exhibits good excavation performance in terms of depth reached-430 mm-both under its own full weight and for 1/6 of its own weight. In other words, the prototype shows excellent robustness to the gravity differences on the Earth and the Moon. With appropriate dust removal, operation has been demonstrated to a depth of 650 mm without any slowing down. The same performance is considered possible for much greater depths.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222429","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6410053/06353935.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Novel Bio-Inspired Planetary Subsurface Explorer: Initial Experimental Study by Prototype Excavator With Propulsion and Excavation Units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353935/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Novel Bio-Inspired Planetary Subsurface Explorer: Initial Experimental Study by Prototype Excavator With Propulsion and Excavation Units","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13219939","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353935/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Development of a Novel Bio-Inspired Planetary Subsurface Explorer: Initial Experimental Study by Prototype Excavator With Propulsion and Excavation Units","sourcePdf":"tmech-omori-2222429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096197S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6353935","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6353936,"authors":[{"name":"Vladislav Kopman","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6410053/6353936/6353936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vladislav Kopman (Sw09) was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1986.

The robot's propulsion system is experimentally characterized for different caudal fin geometries by using an ad hoc thrust-measurement system. The static thrust produced by the vibrating tail is expressed in terms of the oscillatory Reynolds number and compared with similar findings in the literature. Nonlinear vibrations of the propulsive tail are modeled using modal analysis and classical results from the study of large vibrations of slender cylinders in fluids. This analysis allows for computing the oscillatory Reynolds number in terms of the input parameters to the tail vibration. Free-swimming experiments are performed to investigate the performance and maneuverability of the robot and correlate static thrust with terminal speed. This robotic platform is currently being used in ethorobotics research for investigating collective behavior of gregarious fish species and in educational fun-science activities for K-12 students.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Servomotors","Geometry","Production","Vibrations","Propulsion","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","education","flow","marine propulsion","measurement systems","mobile robots","modal analysis","underwater vehicles","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature robotic fish","robotic fish design","robotic fish modeling","robotic fish characterization","biomimetics","bioinspiration","modular caudal fin","robotic fish performance","ad hoc thrust-measurement system","static thrust","vibrating tail","oscillatory Reynolds number","nonlinear vibration","modal analysis","slender cylinder","free-swimming experiment","terminal speed","ethorobotics research","gregarious fish species","educational fun-science activity","caudal fin geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling","propulsion","robots","underwater vehicles","vibrations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222431","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6410053/06353936.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, Modeling, and Characterization of a Miniature Robotic Fish for Research and Education in Biomimetics and Bioinspiration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design, Modeling, and Characterization of a Miniature Robotic Fish for Research and Education in Biomimetics and Bioinspiration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353936/","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353936/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13219940","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Modeling, and Characterization of a Miniature Robotic Fish for Research and Education in Biomimetics and Bioinspiration","sourcePdf":"tmech-porfiri-2222431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107119S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6410053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6410053","articleId":"6353936","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":6353950,"authors":[{"name":"Tee C.

These results verify the advantages of the proposed control strategy in terms of robustness under filter and load parameter variations, average neutral-leg switching frequency reduction, reference tracking error, and percentage total harmonic distortion.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06353956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","startPage":"3469","endPage":"3478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part II: Experimental Implementation and Validation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part II: Experimental Implementation and Validation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191097","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6353956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Current Control of Two-Level Four-Leg Inverters\u2014Part II: Experimental Implementation and Validation","sourcePdf":"tpel-rivera-2227825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095101S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6353956","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6353957,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6353957/6353957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Song was born in Changchun, China, in 1975.

Main circuit design and converter performance evaluation are always important issues to consider before installing a VSC-HVDC system. Investigation into a steady-state analysis method for an MMC-based VSC-HVDC system is necessary. This paper finds a circular interaction among the electrical quantities in an MMC. Through this circular interaction, a key equation can be established to solve the unknown circulating current. A new steady-state model is developed to simply and accurately describe the explicit analytical expressions for various voltage and current quantities in an MMC. The accuracy of the expressions is improved by the consideration of the circulating current when deriving all the analytical expressions. The model's simplicity is demonstrated by having only one key equation to solve. Based on the analytical expressions for the arm voltages, the equivalent circuits for MMC are proposed to improve the current understanding of the operation of MMC. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by comparing its results with the simulation and experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6415310/06353957.pdf","startPage":"3702","endPage":"3713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Steady-State Analysis Method for a Modular Multilevel Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Harmonic analysis","Switches","Mathematical model","Equations","Steady-state","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","HVDC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steady-state analysis method","modular multilevel converter","voltage source converter","high voltage direct current","circuit design","converter performance evaluation","HVDC system","MMC","circular interaction","equivalent circuits","VSC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular multilevel converter (MMC)","steady-state analysis","voltage-source converter HVDC","VSC-HVDC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Steady-State Analysis Method for a Modular Multilevel Converter","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6353957/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13244994","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Steady-State Analysis Method for a Modular Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-song-2227818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066728S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6353957","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6353959,"authors":[{"name":"Siew-Chong Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Siew-Chong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37279974700"},{"name":"Chi Kwan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi Kwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37966729100"},{"name":"S.

This paper reviews the current status and implementation impact of V2G/grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technologies on distributed systems, requirements, benefits, challenges, and strategies for V2G interfaces of both individual vehicles and fleets. The V2G concept can improve the performance of the electricity grid in areas such as efficiency, stability, and reliability. A V2G-capable vehicle offers reactive power support, active power regulation, tracking of variable renewable energy sources, load balancing, and current harmonic filtering. These technologies can enable ancillary services, such as voltage and frequency control and spinning reserve. Costs of V2G include battery degradation, the need for intensive communication between the vehicles and the grid, effects on grid distribution equipment, infrastructure changes, and social, political, cultural, and technical obstacles. Although V2G operation can reduce the lifetime of vehicle batteries, it is projected to become economical for vehicle owners and grid operators. Components and unidirectional/bidirectional power flow technologies of V2G systems, individual and aggregated structures, and charging/recharging frequency and strategies (uncoordinated/coordinated smart) are addressed. Three elements are required for successful V2G operation: power connection to the grid, control and communication between vehicles and the grid operator, and on-board/off-board intelligent metering. Success of the V2G concept depends on standardization of requirements and infrastructure decisions, battery technology, and efficient and smart scheduling of limited fast-charge infrastructure. A charging/discharging infrastructure must be deployed. Economic benefits of V2G technologies depend on vehicle aggregation and charging/recharging frequency and strategies. The benefits will receive increased attention from grid operators and vehicle owners in the future.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227500","startPage":"5673","endPage":"5689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6525347/06353961.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of the Impact of Vehicle-to-Grid Technologies on Distribution Systems and Utility Interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Review of the Impact of Vehicle-to-Grid Technologies on Distribution Systems and Utility Interfaces","volume":"28","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13539086","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6353961/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of the Impact of Vehicle-to-Grid Technologies on Distribution Systems and Utility Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tpel-yilmaz-2227500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.292233S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6525347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"518","xplore-issue":"6525347","articleId":"6353961","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6353992,"authors":[{"name":"Peter J.

We commence by evaluating the NC discrete-input-continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity of both the amplify-and-forward-based (AF) and decode-and-forward-based (DF) SRANs in the direct-sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) uplink (UL). While NC detection has the added benefit of eliminating both the pilot overhead and the power-hungry channel estimation, it tends to form an error floor at high Doppler frequencies. We mitigate this problem using multiple-symbol detection, which increases the detection complexity upon extending the detection window. Finally, a relay-aided soft-input-soft-output multiple-symbol differential sphere detection (SISO-MSDSD) CDMA regime is proposed, which significantly reduces the system's complexity without sacrificing its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2227855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2227855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06353993.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive AF/DF Relaying in the Cooperative DS-CDMA Uplink: Capacity Analysis and Its System Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Successive AF/DF Relaying in the Cooperative DS-CDMA Uplink: Capacity Analysis and Its System Architecture","volume":"62","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307189","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353993/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive AF/DF Relaying in the Cooperative DS-CDMA Uplink: Capacity Analysis and Its System Architecture","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2227855-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099928S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6353993","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6353994,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoshi Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6353994/6353994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaoshi Yang (S\u201909) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2006.

We demonstrate that the classic candidate-search-aided bit-based extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation method is not applicable to the family of PDA-based detectors. Additionally, we reveal that, in contrast to the interpretation in the existing literature, the output symbol probabilities of existing PDA algorithms are not the true a posteriori probabilities (APPs) but, rather, the normalized symbol likelihoods. Therefore, the classic relationship, where the extrinsic LLRs are given by subtracting the a priori LLRs from the a posteriori LLRs, does not hold for the existing PDA-based detectors. Motivated by these revelations, we conceive a new approximate Bayesian-theorem-based logarithmic-domain PDA (AB-Log-PDA) method and unveil the technique of calculating bit-based extrinsic LLRs for the AB-Log-PDA, which facilitates the employment of the AB-Log-PDA in a simplified IDD receiver structure. Additionally, we demonstrate that we may dispense with inner iterations within the AB-Log-PDA in the context of IDD receivers.

The cognitive transmitters are assumed to be able to sense the transmit power of their noncognitive counterparts and the former have a cost for sensing. The Stackelberg equilibrium analysis of this two-level hierarchical game is conducted, which allows us to better understand the effects of cognition on energy efficiency. In particular, it is proven that the network energy efficiency is maximized when only a given fraction of terminals are cognitive. Then, we study a sensing game where all the transmitters are assumed to take the decision of whether to sense (namely to be cognitive) or not. This game is shown to be a weighted potential game, and its set of equilibria is studied. Playing the sensing game in a first phase (e.g., of a time slot) and then playing the power control game is shown to be more efficient individually for all transmitters than playing a game where a transmitter would jointly optimize whether to sense his power level, showing the existence of a kind of Braess paradox. The derived results are illustrated by numerical results and provide some insights on how to deploy cognitive radios in heterogeneous networks in terms of sensing capabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","volume":"62","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13487023","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353995/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Green Power Control in Cognitive Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Power Control in Cognitive Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-hayel-2227858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18092S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6353995","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6353996,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Jun Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Jun","lastName":"Choi","id":"38541810800"},{"name":"Kwang Soon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang Soon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085344089"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6353996","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High temperature superconductors","MIMO","Measurement","Runtime","Complexity theory","Partitioning algorithms","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical tree search","runtime-constrained soft-output MIMO detection","multiple-input-multiple-output detection","performance loss mitigation","HTS algorithm","hierarchical set partitioning","search order","performance-complexity tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) detection","soft-output MIMO detection","tree-search (TS) algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel low-complexity tree-search (TS) algorithm, which is referred to as a hierarchical tree search (HTS), is proposed for soft-output multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) detection to mitigate the performance loss caused by an early termination.

To utilize the abundant network resources of the MLSNs, fair traffic distribution among its satellite layers is, indeed, important. In this paper, we propose a routing method to optimally distribute traffic load among the layers (i.e., the satellite layers in the MLSN). The load balancing scheme of the proposed routing method is developed by adopting a traffic distribution model, which is based upon network capacity estimation and theoretical analysis of the congestion rate in each layer. The performance of the proposed routing method has been validated through extensive computer simulations, which demonstrate that our traffic distribution model is reliable enough to characterize the traffic behavior in the MLSN. Furthermore, in contrast with the basic routing approach, our proposed routing method is more effective in terms of improved throughput and lower packet drops, which are optimized by the theoretical parameter setting.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2227861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06353997.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2227861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Optimized Traffic Distribution for Efficient Network Capacity Utilization in Two-Layered Satellite Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6353997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6353997/","displayDocTitle":"Toward Optimized Traffic Distribution for Efficient Network Capacity Utilization in Two-Layered Satellite Networks","volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371633","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6353997/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Optimized Traffic Distribution for Efficient Network Capacity Utilization in Two-Layered Satellite Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-tada-2227861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09627S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6479353","articleId":"6353997","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6353998,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842400"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6353998","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":486},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Fading","Vectors","Optimization","Iterative methods","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","protocols","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternate MIMO AF relaying networks","interference alignment","spectral efficient protocol","linear filter design","two-hop relaying network","amplify-and-forward relays","multiple antennas","capacity prelog factor loss","half-duplex relaying","suboptimal linear filter designs","minimum mean-square error filter","fading scenarios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternate transmission","amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying","interference alignment (IA)","linear filter design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a two-hop relaying network consisting of one source, one destination, and three amplify-and-forward (AF) relays with multiple antennas.

A fractional-slot concentrated-winding (FSCW) surface-mounted permanent-magnet (SPM) machine has been identified as a suitable candidate for EV applications due to its high power/torque density, high efficiency, and good flux-weakening capability compared with other competing machine topologies. Based on the vehicle characteristics and the reference driving cycle, the motor specifications are established, and the design constraints for the SPM machine to satisfy the peak torque and flux-weakening capabilities are derived. Furthermore, the influence of the key parameters, such as slot-pole number combination, machine inductance, axial length, and number of turns, on the machine copper and iron losses over the NEDC is evaluated. Optimizations were carried for these parameters to minimize the total energy losses over the driving cycle. It has been shown that conventional design methodologies that aim to maximize efficiency in the region close to the rated operating condition may lead to less optimal designs and higher energy losses over the NEDC. A prototype motor for a front- and rear-wheel-driven EV has been designed, manufactured, and tested. The experimental results validate the proposed design methodology.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2227867","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06354000.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2227867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Optimization of a Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motor With Concentrated Windings for Electric Vehicle Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Vehicles","Inductance","Traction motors","Permanent magnet motors","Windings","Permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","machine windings","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","traction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design optimization","surface mounted permanent magnet motor","electric vehicles","traction machines","New European Drive Cycle","NEDC","torque-speed operating range","fractional slot concentrated winding","FSCW","torque density","machine topology","reference driving cycle","flux weakening capability","slot-pole number combination","machine inductance","axial length","machine copper losses","iron losses","total energy loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design optimization","driving cycle","electric vehicles (EVs)","permanent-magnet (PM) motor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Design Optimization of a Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motor With Concentrated Windings for Electric Vehicle Applications","volume":"62","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6354000/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371634","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Optimization of a Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motor With Concentrated Windings for Electric Vehicle Applications","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2227867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083642S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6479353","articleId":"6354000","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6354002,"authors":[{"name":"Phee Lep Yeoh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Phee Lep","lastName":"Yeoh","id":"37391664100"},{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","id":"37269057400"},{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407136200"},{"name":"Daniel B. da Costa","affiliation":["Federal University of Cear\u00e1 (UFC), Sobral-CE, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel B.","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Trung Q.

We highlight that the diversity order of TAS/MRC is the same as TAS/SC, regardless of the underlying fading distribution. As such, we explicitly characterize the SNR gap between TAS/MRC and TAS/SC as the ratio of their respective array gains. An interesting observation is reached that for equal per-hop SNRs, the SNR gap between the two protocols is independent of the number of relays.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06354002.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2227862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2227862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Analysis of Transmit Antenna Selection in MIMO Multirelay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","phase shift keying","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output multirelay networks","Rician channels","Nakagami-m channels","Weibull channels","generalized-K fading channels","closed-form expressions","outage probability","symbol error rate","SER","amplify-and-forward relaying in MIMO multirelay networks","AF relaying in MIMO multirelay networks","transmit antenna selection with receiver maximal-ratio combining","TAS-MRC","M-ary phase-shift keying","M-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation","fading distribution","modulation format","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","transmit antenna selection with receiver selection combining","TAS-SC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","relays","transmit antenna selection with receive maximal-ratio combining (TAS/MRC)","transmit antenna selection with receiver selection combining (TAS/SC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Unified Analysis of Transmit Antenna Selection in MIMO Multirelay Networks","volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6354002/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307193","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Analysis of Transmit Antenna Selection in MIMO Multirelay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yeoh-2227862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104879S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6354002","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6354003,"authors":[{"name":"Wee Seng Chua","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6354003/6354003-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wee Seng Chua received the B.Eng. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2005.

Channel estimation is an important aspect for any communication system and especially for UWB systems in order to appropriately collect the energy from the multipath channel. UWB generally requires a high sampling rate since the bandwidth is large. Channel estimation using CS is studied along with its impact on reducing the sampling rate for an ADC to reduce power. Practical issues regarding the effect of quantization on channel estimation are addressed and a hardware implementation for CS based on the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) allowing sub-Nyquist sampling is proposed. To separate the effect of channel estimation with CS, the performance of the sub-Nyquist ADC is studied in a noiseless and multipath free channel and design decisions are discussed. Comparison with the Nyquist ADC shows that using the sub-Nyquist ADC reduce power by a factor of about 6\u00d7. For the proposed hardware, two receiver architectures based on matched filtering and filtering in the compressed domain (so-called \u201csmashed filtering\u201d) are studied. It is found that with a perfect channel smashed filtering performs better than matched filtering. Finally the effect of channel estimation on the proposed hardware is studied along with two different recovery algorithms namely basis pursuit and matching pursuit.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2222220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06354004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2222220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","startPage":"460","endPage":"469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Compressed Sensing With Quantization on UWB Receivers With Multipath Channel Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Compressed Sensing With Quantization on UWB Receivers With Multipath Channel Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167818","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354004/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Compressed Sensing With Quantization on UWB Receivers With Multipath Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"jetcas-khan-2222220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055212S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6354004","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6354006,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6384897/6354006/6354006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing-Hwa Chen (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan, in 2007.

A combination of dynamic-biasing and stacking prevents all breakdown mechanisms when the PA operates under large voltage swings and facilitates an output impedance close to 50 \u03a9 without a need for an output-matching network. Using a post-fabrication process, the conductive Si substrate of the CMOS SOI PA is etched away and replaced by a semi-insulating aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate to reduce the effect of substrate parasitic capacitances and improve the PA's performance. A small-signal gain of 12.2 dB at 1.8 GHz is achieved with a - 3-dB bandwidth from 1.5 to 2.6 GHz. For high-reliability operation, the PA is biased with a 15-V power supply and a small transistor current density of 0.2 mA/\u03bcm and delivers a saturated output power (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SAT</sub>\n) of 30.2 dBm and a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 23.8%.

The sensor is based on an interdigitated capacitor (IDC) with a microfluidic channel to confine the nanoliter-range liquid and is integrated with microtechnologies to be fully compatible with a massive parallelization at low cost. Both alcohol and biological aqueous solutions are precisely characterized, identified, and quantified in terms of capacitance and conductance's contrasts with respect to pure de-ionized water. Mixtures from 20% down to 1% of ethanol in water exhibit large capacitance's values of 110 and 7 fF at 11 GHz, respectively. Based on the high accuracy of such characterizations, the detection of very small traces of ethanol (down to 100 ppm) can be envisioned. As far as biomedical applications are targeted, we also demonstrate the potential of fetal bovine serum detection in aqueous solution down to 5% v/v. Finally, the sensor is evaluated with living B lymphoma cells suspension in their traditional biological medium. The in-liquid microwave measurement of less than 20 living cells is successfully performed and corresponds to a capacitance contrast of 5 fF at 3 GHz relative to the reference bio-medium. For low cells concentration, the sensor response is proportional to the number of cells on the IDC, which permits to envision cells quantification and proliferation monitoring with this microwave sensing technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6384897/06354008.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2222660","startPage":"4171","endPage":"4177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Nanoliter Liquid Characterization Up to 40 GHz for Biomedical Applications: Toward Noninvasive Living Cells Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354008/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Nanoliter Liquid Characterization Up to 40 GHz for Biomedical Applications: Toward Noninvasive Living Cells Monitoring","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354008/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13187907","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Nanoliter Liquid Characterization Up to 40 GHz for Biomedical Applications: Toward Noninvasive Living Cells Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tmtt-grenier-2222660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084463S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6384897","articleId":"6354008","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6354010,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge A.

The proposed resonator is made up of three metallic conductors: an inner post, an intermediate conductor, and an enclosure. This structure provides two asynchronous resonant modes that can be used for realizing compact microwave dual-band filters. Such dual-band filters offer the low cost, compact size, and ease of manufacturing features of traditional combline resonator filters, with additional size reduction due to the fact that a single physical cavity provides two electrical resonators. In addition, the new cavity introduces a transmission zero in the guard-bands enhancing the filter selectivity, while keeping a simple and compact inline topology. The design of filters based on this novel resonator is discussed, starting with the resonator circuit model, the coupling scheme, and the complete filter design methodology. Simulations as well as experimental results of a tenth-order (2 \u00d7 5) dual-band filter with a measured rejection level in excess of 100 dB in the guard-band are presented to show the concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","volume":"60","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13187908","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354010/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Triple-Conductor Combline Resonators for Dual-Band Filters With Enhanced Guard-Band Selectivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triple-Conductor Combline Resonators for Dual-Band Filters With Enhanced Guard-Band Selectivity","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ruizcruz-2223482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06507S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6384897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6384897","articleId":"6354010","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6354261,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Shinya Sugiura (Sugiura@ieee.org) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, in 2010.

A Tier 1 provider owns a homogeneous network resource and holds an auction to allocate this resource among Tier 2 operators, who in turn allocate the acquired resource among Tier 3 entities. The Tier 2 operators play the role of middlemen, since their utilities for the resource depend on the revenues gained from resale. We first consider static hierarchical auction mechanisms for indivisible resources. We study a class of mechanisms wherein each sub-mechanism is either a first-price or VCG auction, and show that incentive compatibility and efficiency cannot be simultaneously achieved. We also briefly discuss sequential auctions as well as the incomplete information setting. We then propose two VCG-type hierarchical mechanisms for divisible resources. The first one is composed of single-sided auctions at each tier, while the second one employs double-sided auctions at all tiers except Tier 1. Both mechanisms induce an efficient Nash equilibrium.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6354264/06354270.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Auction Mechanisms for Network Resource Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Auction Mechanisms for Network Resource Allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354270/","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6354270/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13136442","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Auction Mechanisms for Network Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"2117jsac1112tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065104S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6354264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6354264","articleId":"6354270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6354277,"authors":[{"name":"Valentino Pacifici","affiliation":["Laboratory for Communication Networks, School of Electrical Engineering, and the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6354264/6354277/6354277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Valentino Pacifici studied computer engineering at Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy.

The influence graph models limited interaction between the players due to, e.g., the network topology: the payoff that an allocated resource yields to a player depends only on the resources allocated by her neighbors on the graph. We prove that pure strategy Nash equilibria (NE) always exist in graphical resource allocation games and we provide a linear time algorithm to compute equilibria. We show that these games do not admit a potential function: if there are closed paths in the influence graph then there can be best reply cycles. Nevertheless, we show that from any initial allocation of a resource allocation game it is possible to reach a NE by playing best replies and we provide a bound on the maximal number of update steps required. Furthermore we give sufficient conditions in terms of the influence graph topology and the utility structure under which best reply cycles do not exist. Finally we propose an efficient distributed algorithm to reach an equilibrium over an arbitrary graph and we illustrate its performance on different random graph topologies.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2190","endPage":"2199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354264","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6354264/06354277.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Telecommunication services","Communication networks","Resource allocation","Distributed processing","Graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Internet","radio transmitters","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["player-specific graphical resource allocation games","distributed resource allocation","networked systems","influence graph models","network topology","Nash equilibria","linear time algorithm","NE","influence graph topology","distributed algorithm","random graph topologies","player-specific utility","CPU caching","computer architectures","clean-slate information centric network architectures","cooperative caching","Internet service providers","radio spectrum","radio transmitters","job distributed scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resource allocation","graphical games","player-specific congestion games","best reply dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Convergence in Player-Specific Graphical Resource Allocation Games","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354277/","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6354277/","accessionNumber":"13136449","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence in Player-Specific Graphical Resource Allocation Games","sourcePdf":"2190jsac1112pacifici.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127316S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6354264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6354264","articleId":"6354277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6354282,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, USA","Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6354264/6354282/6354282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingyi Hong received his B.E. degree in Communications Engineering from the Zhejiang University, China, in 2005, and his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stony Brook University in 2007, and Ph.D. degree in Systems Engineering from University of Virginia in 2011.

Efficient resource management protocols must rely on users truthfully reporting privately held information such as downlink channel states. However, individual users can manipulate the resulting resource allocation (by misreporting their private information) if by doing so they can improve their payoff. Therefore, it is of interest to design efficient resource management protocols that are strategy-proof, i.e. it is in the users' best interests to truthfully report their private information. Unfortunately, we show that the implementation of any protocol that is efficient and strategy-proof is NP-hard. Thus, we propose a computationally tractable strategy-proof mechanism that is approximately efficient, i.e. the solution obtained yields at least 1/2 of the optimal throughput.

We first consider a system with a single PU band, in which the SU decisions are fixed. Employing queueing-theoretic methods, we obtain explicit expressions for the expected delays associated with using the PU band. Based on that, we then consider self-interested SUs and study the interaction between them as a non-cooperative game. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Nash equilibrium, and characterize the equilibrium behavior explicitly. Using our equilibrium results, we show how to maximize revenue from renting dedicated bands to SUs and briefly discuss the extension of our model to multiple PUs.

In this paper, we propose a distributed-centralized and incentive-aware spectrum sharing scheme for the multiple-PU scenario, which introduces a Random Leader who is elected randomly from SUs or PUs. The distributed aspect of our scheme lies in that it requires no central control entities, which can be independently implemented within a distributed spectrum market. The centralized aspect is that the leader draws up and assigns the socially optimal contracts for all PUs and SUs in a centralized manner, which maximizes the throughput of the whole network and attains the economic robustness (including Incentive Compatibility and Individual Rationality). Analysis shows that the proposed scheme takes in the advantages of both centralized and distributed schemes but overcomes their weaknesses. We use the proposed scheme to study two sharing scenarios: the short-term and the long-term spectrum sharing. The Short-Term Sharing (STS) focuses on distributing PUs' idle spectra within one time slot while the Long-Term Sharing (LTS) considers multiple slots, where the spectrum mobility must be investigated. As an integrated design of both STS and LTS, our scheme not only fulfils SUs' heterogeneous spectrum requirements but also obtains the socially optimal throughput while accounting for both SUs' and PUs' incentives.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121219","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6354264/06354285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2274","endPage":"2284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed-Centralized Scheme for Short- and Long-Term Spectrum Sharing with a Random Leader in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed-Centralized Scheme for Short- and Long-Term Spectrum Sharing with a Random Leader in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354285/","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6354285/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13136457","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed-Centralized Scheme for Short- and Long-Term Spectrum Sharing with a Random Leader in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2274jsac1112liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134388S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6354264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6354264","articleId":"6354285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6354287,"authors":[{"name":"Diep N.

With spatial multiplexing over each frequency band, a multi-antenna CR node controls its antenna radiation directions and allocates power for each data stream by appropriately adjusting its precoding matrix. Our objective is to design a set of precoding matrices (one per band) at each CR node so that power and spectrum are optimally allocated for the node and its interference is steered away from unintended receivers. The problem is non-convex, with the number of variables growing quadratically with the number of antenna elements. To tackle it, we translate it into a noncooperative game. We derive an optimal pricing policy for each node, which adapts to the node's neighboring conditions and drives the game to a Nash-Equilibrium (NE). The network throughput under this NE equals to that of a locally optimal solution of the non-convex centralized problem. To find the set of precoding matrices at each node (best response), we develop a low-complexity distributed algorithm by exploiting the strong duality of the convex per-user optimization problem. The number of variables in the distributed algorithm is independent of the number of antenna elements. A centralized (cooperative) algorithm is also developed. Simulations show that the network throughput under the distributed algorithm rapidly converges to that of the centralized one. Finally, we develop a MAC protocol that implements our resource allocation and beamforming scheme. Extensive simulations show that the proposed protocol dramatically improves the network throughput and reduces power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6354264/06354287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354264","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Price-Based Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Management in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Price-Based Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Management in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13136459","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354287/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Price-Based Joint Beamforming and Spectrum Management in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2295jsac1112nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107715S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6354264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6354264","articleId":"6354287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6354316,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Haghmaram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IHU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Haghmaram","id":"37428095200"},{"name":"Ali Aroudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IHU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Aroudi","id":"37085776879"},{"name":"Mohammad Hossein Ghezel","affiliation":["Aiagh, Department of Electrical, Engineering, IHU, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hossein","lastName":"Ghezel","id":"37087925895"},{"name":"Hadi Veisi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Veisi","id":"37540737000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-60810-48-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0708-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-83-60810-51-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6354316","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Neurons","Radial basis function networks","Training","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Biological neural networks","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","cepstral analysis","multilayer perceptrons","neural net architecture","pattern classification","radial basis function networks","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LPC feature parameters","MFCC feature parameters","automatic noise recognition problem","MLP neural network classifier","RBF neural network classifier","linear predictive coefficients","Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","neural network architecture","ANR approach","recognition performance","stationary noise","nonstationary noise","classification rate","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354316","abstract":"This paper studies the automatic noise recognition problem based on RBF and MLP neural networks classifiers using linear predictive and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (LPC and MFCC).

Especially infrastructure services, like storage and scalable computing resources, are gaining relevance and provide alternatives to conventional sourcing models. Despite the Cloud paradigm of flexible and limitless scalability the lack of standardization presents a big challenge in this context. Due to many providers, which are using different Cloud software including proprietary interfaces, the interoperability in the Cloud remains a theoretical construct. In this paper we examine standardization approaches within Cloud Computing and provide a comparison to practical implementations of interfaces of relevant Cloud software on the market. Finally, characteristics for a potential Cloud standard on the infrastructure level will be postulated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330483/6354297/06354365.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"930","publicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standardization approaches within Cloud Computing: Evaluation of infrastructure as a service architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Companies","Standards organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","open systems","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standardization approaches","cloud computing","infrastructure-as-a-service architecture evaluation","IT services","cloud software","proprietary interfaces","interoperability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Standardization approaches within Cloud Computing: Evaluation of infrastructure as a service architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354365/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13147295","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standardization approaches within Cloud Computing: Evaluation of infrastructure as a service architecture","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051163S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330483","isNumber":"6354297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330483","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6354297","articleId":"6354365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Info Processing Socit","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6354373,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Sami","affiliation":["Faculty of Computers and Information, Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Sami","id":"38515421300"},{"name":"Aboul Ella Hassanien","affiliation":["Faculty of Computers and Information, Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Aboul Ella","lastName":"Hassanien","id":"37339045300"},{"name":"Nashwa El-Bendary","affiliation":["Maritime Transport Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Arab Academy for Science and Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Nashwa","lastName":"El-Bendary","id":"38274196000"},{"name":"Robert C.

If the resampling ratio is not expressed as the ratio of small integer numbers or is not a fixed value, the sample rate conversion algorithm based on fractional delay filters might be used since it allows for arbitrary resampling ratios. The performance of such algorithm depends solely on the method used to design fractional delay filters. In this paper we propose a novel classification of fractional delay filter design methods dividing them into three general categories: optimal fractional filter design, offset window method and polyphase decomposition. The proposed classification is based on differences in properties of the sample rate conversion algorithm based on fractional delay filters.","startPage":"701","endPage":"706","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330483/6354297/06354408.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional delay filter design for sample rate conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fractional delay filter design for sample rate conversion","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354408/","accessionNumber":"13147338","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354408/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional delay filter design for sample rate conversion","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051948S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330483","isNumber":"6354297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330483","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6354297","articleId":"6354408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Info Processing Socit","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6354421,"authors":[{"name":"Uwe Arnold","affiliation":["AHP GmbH & Co.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been widely applied to Blind Source Separation (BSS) problems. However, the separation results are sensitive to the initialization of parameters of NMF. Avoiding the subjectivity of choosing parameters, we used the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering technique to estimate the mixing matrix and to reduce the requirement for sparsity. Also, decreasing the constraints is regarded in this paper by using Semi-NMF. In this paper we propose a new two-step algorithm in order to solve the underdetermined blind source separation. We show how to combine the FCM clustering technique with the gradient-based NMF with the multi-layer technique. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can separate the source signals with high signal-to-noise ratio and quite low cost time compared with some algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330483/6354297/06354486.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"700","publicationTitle":"2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on Fuzzy C-Means and Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Blind source separation","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","fuzzy set theory","matrix decomposition","pattern clustering","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underdetermined blind source separation","seminonnegative matrix factorization","BSS problems","semiNMF parameter initialization","fuzzy c-means clustering technique","FCM clustering technique","sparsity","two-step algorithm","gradient-based NMF","multilayer technique","signal-to-noise ratio","cost time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on Fuzzy C-Means and Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354486/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13147413","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on Fuzzy C-Means and Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053956S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330483","isNumber":"6354297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330483","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6354297","articleId":"6354486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Polish Info Processing Socit","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6354549,"authors":[{"name":"Abi Grogan","firstName":"Abi","lastName":"Grogan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1750-9637"}],"articleNumber":"6354549","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Institution of Engineering and Technology","url":"http://www.theiet.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354549","doi":"10.1049/et.2012.0801","endPage":"31","startPage":"28","publicationTitle":"Engineering & Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/10908/6303790/06354549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/et.2012.0801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6303790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Paralympic technology","abstract":"AN ISSUE of fairness has long been a red flag to research teams aligned with privileged first-world Paralympics teams such as Great Britain, Australia and Japan.

Sequence alignment is used to extract similar parts of an input protein (or DNA) sequence from protein (or DNA) databases, in order to investigate biological evolution and genomic genealogy. It is a very important and difficult task in bioinformatics. Even though BLAST is an efficient sequence alignment algorithm, it cannot cope with the rapid growth of databases. Initially, in a preprocessing step, BLAST creates query words and a neighborhood word list. Next, it performs three processing steps: a) seed search, b) ungapped extension, and c) gapped extension. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator to speed up all processing steps of BLAST, including preprocessing, related works speed up only a subset of them. Each processing step is realized by a hardware module. Thus, we can easily speed up each processing step by duplicating the corresponding module. By implementing the proposed accelerator in a field programmable gate array (FPGA), we demonstrate that a high-performance accelerator can be realized with reasonable hardware cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171069","htmlLink":"/document/6354673/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hardware Accelerator for BLAST","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Accelerator for BLAST","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"4800a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076449S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6354296","isNumber":"6354670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6354296","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6354670","articleId":"6354673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6354681,"authors":[{"name":"Naohito Nakasato","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Naohito","lastName":"Nakasato","id":"37560670800"},{"name":"Hiroshi Daisaka","affiliation":["Hitotsubashi University"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Daisaka","id":"37945481000"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Fukushige","affiliation":["K & F Computing Research"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Fukushige","id":"37369828100"},{"name":"Atsushi Kawai","affiliation":["K & F Computing Research"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Kawai","id":"37369828600"},{"name":"Junichiro Makino","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Junichiro","lastName":"Makino","id":"37369836400"},{"name":"Tadashi Ishikawa","affiliation":["High Energy Accelerator Research Organization"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37086707688"},{"name":"Fukuko Yuasa","affiliation":["High Energy Accelerator Research Organization"],"firstName":"Fukuko","lastName":"Yuasa","id":"37086707788"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4800-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6354681","dbTime":"59 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Field programmable gate arrays","Process control","Computer architecture","Registers","Application specific integrated circuits","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GRAPE-MP processor","quadruple-hexuple-octuple-precision arithmetic operation","FPGA","SIMD accelerator boards","processing elements","PE","memory components","structured ASIC chip","FPGA chip","eASIC corp","Feynman loop integrals","hardware based approach","frequency 100 MHz","computer speed 1.2 GFLOPS","computer speed 0.5 GFLOPS","computer speed 1.6 GFLOPS"]}],"abstract":"We describe the design and performance of the GRAPE-MPs, a series of SIMD accelerator boards for quadruple/hexuple/octuple-precision arithmetic operations.

We also present the performance results with the multiple GRAPE-MPs boards. The achieved performance of four MP8 boards is about 1.6 Gflops.

Handshake join is a highly parallelized algorithm for window-based stream joins. Result collection performed by a merging network is a significant design issue for the handshake join operator because the merging network becomes an overwhelming bottleneck for scalable performance. To address the issue, an adaptive merging network is proposed for hardware implementation of the algorithm. The proposed architecture is implemented on an FPGA and it is evaluated in terms of the hardware resource usage, the maximum clock frequency, and the performance. Experimental results demonstrate up to 16.3 times higher throughput than nested loops-style join implementation without dropping any tuples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance for handshake join operator implemented on an FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/MCSoC.2012.21","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore SoCs","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore SoCs","pdfPath":"/iel5/6354296/6354670/06354682.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSoC.2012.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Merging Network Architecture for Handshake Join Operator on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354682/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Merging Network Architecture for Handshake Join Operator on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354682/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171078","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Merging Network Architecture for Handshake Join Operator on FPGA","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"4800a084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055897S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6354296","isNumber":"6354670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6354296","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6354670","articleId":"6354682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6354694,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Caselli","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Caselli","id":"38513757000"},{"name":"Alessandro Strano","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Strano","id":"37319001300"},{"name":"Daniele Ludovici","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Ludovici","id":"38514992400"},{"name":"Davide Bertozzi","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Bertozzi","id":"37274635000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4800-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6354694","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Switches","Circuit faults","Built-in self-test","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit testing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative built-in self-testing","self-diagnosis procedure","NoC bisynchronous channels","on-chip network","bisynchronous communication channels","BIST operations","test application time","inherent structural redundancy","error detection","stuck-at faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks-on-Chip","BIST","Pseudo-Random Testing","Bisynchronous"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a built-in self-test/self-diagnosis procedure at start-up of an on-chip network (NoC) for bisynchronous communication channels.

Recently, merging NoC to the third dimension (3D-NoC) has been proposed as a promising solution offering lower power consumption and higher speed. One of the most important design choices for 3D-NoC implementation is the routing algorithm, as it controls the path decision that a flit has tofollow while traveling along the network. This has a direct impact on the overall system performance. In this paper, we present an efficient routing algorithm for 3D-NoC named Look-Ahead-XYZ (LA-XYZ). This algorithm aims to minimize the communication latency and power consumption while enhancing the system throughput. Comparison results with systems adopting two dimensional routing showed that, using JPEG encoder and Matrix applications, LA-XYZ reduces the communication latency with up to 44.9% and enhances the throughput that can reach the 45.3% while observing an average 15.9% reduction in terms of dynamic power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354695/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13171091","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LA-XYZ: Low Latency, High Throughput Look-Ahead Routing Algorithm for 3D Network-on-Chip (3D-NoC) Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LA-XYZ: Low Latency, High Throughput Look-Ahead Routing Algorithm for 3D Network-on-Chip (3D-NoC) Architecture","confLoc":"Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan","sourcePdf":"4800a167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097111S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6354296","isNumber":"6354670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6354296","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6354670","articleId":"6354695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6354728,"authors":[{"name":"Fatos Xhafa","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Fatos","lastName":"Xhafa","id":"37283419700"},{"name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 Ruiz","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Ruiz","id":"38514422100"},{"name":"Santi Caball\u00e9","affiliation":["Open University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Santi","lastName":"Caball\u00e9","id":"37283418700"},{"name":"Evjola Spaho","affiliation":["Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Evjola","lastName":"Spaho","id":"37593782400"},{"name":"Leonard Barolli","affiliation":["Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Barolli","id":"37267114100"},{"name":"Rozeta Miho","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Tirana, Albania"],"firstName":"Rozeta","lastName":"Miho","id":"37322148700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1986-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4734-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6354728","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Electronic mail","Data mining","Web servers","Analytical models","Monitoring","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","grid computing","Internet","security of data","user modelling","virtual reality","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive processing","activity logs","online Web-based application","user interaction data","log data files","user modelling","user activity analysis","data analytics","data security","data monitoring","preprocessed log files","cleaned up log files","redundant information","futile information","information extraction","real virtual campus","distributed infrastructures","cluster computing","open grid engine","planet lab platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive Processing","Log Files","Cluster Computing","Planet Lab","Virtual Campus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354728","doi":"10.1109/EIDWT.2012.64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIDWT.2012.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354713","publicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353658/6354713/06354728.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive Processing of Activity Logs of a Virtual Campus","abstract":"Online web-based application that heavily require user interaction, either among users or among users and the application, generate huge amounts of data. Recording such user interaction data, usually in the form of log data files, could be very useful for different purposes such as user modelling, user activity analysis, data analytics, security, monitoring, etc. However, such data is not ready to be analysed due log files are to be pre-processed and cleaned up from redundant and futile information. Due to the large amounts of data generated daily, the massive processing is a foremost step in extracting useful information from log data files. In this work we study the viability of massive processing of log data files of a real Virtual Campus using different distributed infrastructures. More precisely, we study the time performance of processing daily log files of a Virtual Campus using cluster computing(under Open Grid Engine) and Planet Lab platform. The study reveals the complexity and challenges of massive processing in the big data era.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354728/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13169529","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Massive Processing of Activity Logs of a Virtual Campus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive Processing of Activity Logs of a Virtual Campus","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"4734a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066277S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353658","isNumber":"6354713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353658","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6354713","articleId":"6354728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6354756,"authors":[{"name":"Vlado Stankovski","affiliation":["Department of Construction Informatics, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Vlado","lastName":"Stankovski","id":"37418855200"},{"name":"Jernej Juna","affiliation":["Univerza v Ljubljani, Ljubljana, SI"],"firstName":"Jernej","lastName":"Juna","id":"37087070348"},{"name":"Dana Petcu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, West University of Timi\u015foara, Timi\u015foara, Romania"],"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Petcu","id":"37282697900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1986-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4734-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6354756","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":187},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Legacy Engineering Applications for Cloud Computing: Experience with the mOSAIC API and Platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","MATLAB","Finite element methods","Clouds","Computational modeling","Java"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","civil engineering computing","cloud computing","grid computing","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legacy engineering applications","cloud computing","mOSAIC API","civil engineering","simulation services","super computers","clusters","grids","sky computing technologies","legacy codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","legacy applications","enabling","civil engineering"]}],"abstract":"Currently, in many engineering areas, including civil engineering, there are increasing demands for various modelling and simulation services that would be accessible over the Web. The basis for such solutions could be existing legacy applications with proven properties, such as numerical stability of the used algorithms. When using traditional infrastructures, such as super computers, clusters or grids, it is necessary to make significant changes in the existing code or even complete re-writing to be able to run such legacy applications on a designated infrastructure. Cloud computing in general, and emerging sky computing technologies, such as mosaic API and platform in particular, make it possible to develop, deploy and monitor Cloud computing applications by re-using existing legacy codes. The mosaic platform can also be used to dynamically provision computational, storage and communication resources, which are needed for such applications, thus reducing operational costs. This paper analyses the possibilities for development of engineering applications by using the mosaic programming model. In the provided case study, an existing Math Works' MATLAB application used for analysis of structures under static loading is used on the Cloud and various benefits, such as elasticity and improved quality are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/EIDWT.2012.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIDWT.2012.49","publicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353658/6354713/06354756.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Legacy Engineering Applications for Cloud Computing: Experience with the mOSAIC API and Platform","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13169557","htmlLink":"/document/6354756/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Legacy Engineering Applications for Cloud Computing: Experience with the mOSAIC API and Platform","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"4734a281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042266S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353658","isNumber":"6354713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6354713","articleId":"6354756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6354801,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Ma","affiliation":["Information College, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37535936800"},{"name":"Yue Qiu","affiliation":["Information College, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37534109200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2331-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4779-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6354801","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Security","Carbon dioxide","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","cloud computing","information resources","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing applications","information resource dynamic allocation","data center energy efficiency improvement","resources certification","data storage","digital resources","carbon resource footprint","carbon emissions management certification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","information resources construction","resources combination","Measurement of carbon emission"]}],"abstract":"To achieve the low carbon goal, it is important to measure and control carbon emission.

To speed up access, file can be replicated so a user can access a nearby replica. In this paper, we propose architecture to convert Globally One Cloud to Locally Many Clouds. By combining replication and scheduling, this architecture will improve efficiency, accessibility and reliability. In the case of failure of one sub cloud or one cloud service, clients can start using another cloud under \"failover\" techniques. As a result, no one cloud service will go down.","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.120","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354802.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing: Architecture for Efficient Provision of Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354802/","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing: Architecture for Efficient Provision of Services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148545","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354802/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing: Architecture for Efficient Provision of Services","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4779a018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084998S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353820","isNumber":"6354798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353820","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6354798","articleId":"6354802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6354806,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Indrawan-Santiago","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Indrawan-Santiago","id":"38513623000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2331-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4779-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6354806","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1709},"abstract":"The demand to process large sets of data has increased in the last few years from both the scientific and business community.

Cloud Web Services can sit well within three models of Cyber-Physical Systems, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). With any Cyber-Physical system use Cloud Web Services it inherits a security problem, the HX-DoS attack. HX-DoS attack is a combination of HTTP and XML messages that are intentionally sent to flood and destroy the communication channel of the cloud service provider. The relevance of this research is that TCP/IP flood attacks are a common problem and a lot of research to mitigate them has previously been discussed. But HTTP denial of service and XML denial of service problem has only been addressed in a few papers. In this paper, we get closer to closing this gap on this problem with our new defence system called Pre-Decision, Advance Decision, Learning System (ENDER). In our previous experiments using our Cloud Protector, we were successful at detecting and mitigate 91% with a 9% false positive of HX-DoS attack traffic. In this paper, ENDER was able to improve upon this result by being trained and tested on the same data, but with a greater result of 99% detection and 1% false positive.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.146","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354861.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"434","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting and Mitigating HX-DoS Attacks against Cloud Web Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Detecting and Mitigating HX-DoS Attacks against Cloud Web Services","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148604","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting and Mitigating HX-DoS Attacks against Cloud Web Services","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4779a429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062835S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353820","isNumber":"6354798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353820","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6354798","articleId":"6354861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6354901,"authors":[{"name":"Milos Stojmenovic","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Computation, Singidunum University, Belgrade, Serbia"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Stojmenovic","id":"37601444900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2331-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4779-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6354901","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":860},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Iris recognition","Face recognition","Face","Feature extraction","Cloud computing","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cloud computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","business model","Internet","MCC","mobile device","biometric application","fingerprint","face recognition","iris scanning","client computer","network throughput","cloud infrastructure","information processing","communication channel","client node","cloud biometric technology","real time evidence processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud biometrics","fingerprint","iris","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"The cloud computing concept became popular in 2006 and encapsulates a business model of providing services across the Internet. The Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) concept was proposed in 2007. Recent advances in cloud computing have given a platform to various computationally heavy tasks and made them readily accessible to even mobile devices. Biometric applications are dedicated to fingerprint, face, or iris scanning and they typically work in a laboratory setting where the client computer has unlimited access to the throughput and computational resources of the network. Mobile devices can bring biometric evidence back to the laboratory in order for it to be processed. On a cloud infrastructure, information processing could be completed much faster. The limiting factor then becomes the battery power of the device and the throughput of the communication channel of the client node to the cloud. It is important to reduce as much as possible the packet size of the query or task given to the cloud, and also minimize the size of the received response to be able to incorporate cloud biometric technology for real time evidence processing. This position paper sets the mobile cloud computing agenda for biometric applications.","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354901.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Cloud Computing for Biometric Applications","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Cloud Computing for Biometric Applications","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148644","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6354901/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Cloud Computing for Biometric Applications","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4779a654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053381S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353820","isNumber":"6354798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353820","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6354798","articleId":"6354901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6354904,"authors":[{"name":"Seokhwan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhwan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37834673100"},{"name":"Mokdong Chung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mokdong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37403011000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2331-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4779-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6354904","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354904","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Biological neural networks","Computational modeling","Brain modeling","Data models","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","radial basis function networks","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model","extended feature-based neuron","NNDFF","artificial intelligence technology","smart robot","recurrent structure","input point-neuron distance","neuron feature","neuron access frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","NNDFF","non-recurrent structure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354904.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Model Using Extended Feature-Based Neuron: NNDFF","abstract":"The neural network is useful algorithm to adopt for unknown context in the artificial intelligence technology as one of the core elements of the smart robot.

In this paper, we design CLIP, a novel Cross-pLatform quantum Information reconciliation experimental tool. CLIP is written in the C++ language to run at various platforms(including Linux and Windows, etc.), and it works in a distributed paradigm to enhance the experimental performance. We conducted numerous experiments on Quantum LDPC codes and evaluate the performance using our CLIP tool. Experimental results show that our LDPC platform is very powerful on the research of Information reconciliation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354913.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"726","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLIP: A Distributed Emulation Platform for Research on Information Reconciliation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","distributed processing","parity check codes","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CLIP","distributed emulation platform","cross-platform quantum information reconciliation experimental tool","quantum key distribution system","QKD system","QKD post processing","information processing","C++ language","quantum LDPC codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Key Distribution","Information reconciliation","Experimental Platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"CLIP: A Distributed Emulation Platform for Research on Information Reconciliation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354913/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148656","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLIP: A Distributed Emulation Platform for Research on Information Reconciliation","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4779a721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074125S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353820","isNumber":"6354798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353820","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6354798","articleId":"6354913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6354934,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichiro Takabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Open Information Systems Engineering, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Takabe","id":"38513097900"},{"name":"Katsuyoshi Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Open Information Systems Engineering, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuyoshi","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37307631200"},{"name":"Motoi Yamagiwa","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences and Arts, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Yamagiwa","id":"37318384900"},{"name":"Minoru Uehara","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Sciences and Arts, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37277097700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2331-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4779-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6354934","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":249},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed Sensor Network for Living Environments Using Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Power demand","Wireless communication","Cloud computing","Power measurement","Current measurement","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","cloud computing","energy consumption","energy management systems","global warming","home automation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["living environments","cloud computing","global warming","green IT","building and energy management systems","BEMS","home energy management systems","energy-saving schemes","IT equipment","sensor network technology","conventional HEMS","expensive node","energy consumption analysis","supersaturated cloud","stable cloud operation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, global warming has become a serious world-wide problem. Green IT is recognized as one of the solutions to global warming. In particular, we know that Building and Energy Management Systems (BEMS) and Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are effective energy-saving schemes based on the visualization, control, and management of energy consumed by IT equipment. Sensor network technology is widely used in such systems. In a conventional HEMS, an expensive node is required to visualize the results of analyzing energy consumption. In recent years, use of a cloud has become very popular. In this study, we propose a HEMS, which is based on utilization of a cloud and a sensor network. In our method, the cloud cost can be reduced because a supersaturated cloud is reasonable and we also discuss avoiding incidents for stable cloud operation.","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2012.42","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353820/6354798/06354934.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6354798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2012.42","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6354934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6354934/","displayDocTitle":"Proposed Sensor Network for Living Environments Using Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148677","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6354934/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed Sensor Network for Living Environments Using Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4779a838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055221S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353820","isNumber":"6354798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353820","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6354798","articleId":"6354934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6355001,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Abou-Rjeily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Abou-Rjeily","id":"38529367600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6355001","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355001","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Fading","Optical fiber communication","Adaptive optics","Error probability","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","optical links","probability","resource allocation","scintillation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","quantum limited multihop free-space optical communication systems","conditional error probability","quantum limit scenario","closed form expressions","fading variance","scintillation index","equal power distribution strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free-space optics","FSO","cooperation","relaying"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.111412.121903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6380512/06355001.pdf","startPage":"2068","endPage":"2071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.111412.121903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6380512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Quantum-Limited Multihop Free-Space Optical Communication Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we propose two novel power allocation strategies for multihop Free-Space Optical (FSO) networks with any number of hops.

This has been possible mainly due to the current trend toward higher spatial resolution and novel imaging modes. A major driver for this development has been and still is the airborne SAR technology, which is usually ahead of the capabilities of spaceborne sensors by several years. Today's airborne sensors are capable of delivering high-quality SAR data with decimeter resolution and allow the development of novel approaches in data analysis and information extraction from SAR. In this paper, a review about the abilities and needs of today's very high-resolution airborne SAR sensors is given, based on and summarizing the longtime experience of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) with airborne SAR technology and its applications. A description of the specific requirements of high-resolution airborne data processing is presented, followed by an extensive overview of emerging applications of high-resolution SAR. In many cases, information extraction from high-resolution airborne SAR imagery has achieved a mature level, turning SAR technology more and more into an operational tool. Such abilities, which are today mostly limited to airborne SAR, might become typical in the next generation of spaceborne SAR missions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very-High-Resolution Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging: Signal Processing and Applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2220511","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6461951/06355595.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2220511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355595","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355595/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Very-High-Resolution Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging: Signal Processing and Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"101","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6355595/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very-High-Resolution Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging: Signal Processing and Applications","sourcePdf":"jproc-reigber-2220511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.282011S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6461951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6461951","articleId":"6355595","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6355606,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Han","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6466438/6355606/6355606-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Han received the B.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008.

However, cross-tier interference between femtocells and macrocells complicates the process of two-tier network planning. In the network planning, interference margin (IM) is a key parameter for the link budget to indicate the impact of interference and calculate the cell coverage. The conventional IM evaluation method for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems does not consider the cross-tier interference and is unavailable for the co-existence of macrocell and femtocell scenario. In this paper, a proper method to obtain macrocell uplink IM considering the cross-tier interference is presented, and the closed-form expression of IM is derived as a function of system load.

In this paper, we first propose integration of system monitoring modules and intrusion detection modules in the context of WSNs. We propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based mechanism to detect false injected data. Specifically, by monitoring behaviors of its neighbors and using EKF to predict their future states (actual in-network aggregated values), each node aims at setting up a normal range of the neighbors' future transmitted aggregated values. This task is challenging because of potential high packet loss rate, harsh environment, and sensing uncertainty. We illustrate how to use EKF to address this challenge to create effective local detection mechanisms. Using different aggregation functions (average, sum, max, and min), we present how to obtain a theoretical threshold. We further apply an algorithm of combining cumulative summation and generalized likelihood ratio to increase detection sensitivity. To overcome the limitations of local detection mechanisms, we illustrate how our proposed local detection approaches work together with the system monitoring module to differentiate between malicious events and emergency events. We conduct experiments and simulations to evaluate local detection mechanisms under different aggregation functions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based Secure In-Network Aggregation for Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2012.2223531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/6466438/06355608.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2012.2223531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Based Secure In-Network Aggregation for Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6355608/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324233","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Based Secure In-Network Aggregation for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-sun-2223531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146908S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6466438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6466438","articleId":"6355608","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355617,"authors":[{"name":"Shyam Kamal","affiliation":["IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Shyam","lastName":"Kamal","id":"38263628700"},{"name":"Arun Raman","affiliation":["IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Raman","id":"38247452400"},{"name":"Bijnan Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Bijnan","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37299193300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6355617","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2312},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355617","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Robustness","Switches","Sliding mode control","Convergence","Integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral equations","robust control","time-varying systems","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain fractional order integrator","integral sliding mode control","robust finite-time stabilization","nominal controller","switching controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite time stabilization","fractional order integrator","integral sliding-mode control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2012.2228051","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6517505/06355617.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6517505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2012.2228051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time Stabilization of Fractional Order Uncertain Chain of Integrator: An Integral Sliding Mode Approach","abstract":"In this technical note, a novel methodology for robust finite-time stabilization of a chain of uncertain fractional order integrator is proposed.

For sparse or compressible RF environments, an alternate approach to conventional sampling is analog-to-information (A2I) to enable sub-Nyquist rate sampling based on compressive sensing (CS) principles. This paper presents the Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), an efficient A2I architecture that folds the broadband RF input prior to digitization by a narrowband ADC. The folding is achieved by undersampling the RF spectrum with a stream of short pulses that have a phase modulated sampling period. The undersampled signals then fold down into a low pass interpolation filter. The pulse sample time modulation induces a corresponding phase modulation on the received signals that is scaled by an integer modulation index that varies with the Nyquist zone (i.e., fold number), allowing the signals to be separated based on the measured modulation index. Unlike many schemes motivated by CS that randomize the RF prior to digitization, the NYFR substantially preserves signal structure. This enables information recovery with very low computational complexity algorithms in addition to traditional CS reconstruction techniques. The paper includes a comparison of seven other A2I architectures with the NYFR.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2223611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06355638.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2223611","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","startPage":"564","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog-to-Information and the Nyquist Folding Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analog-to-Information and the Nyquist Folding Receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355638/","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6355638/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167819","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-to-Information and the Nyquist Folding Receiver","sourcePdf":"jetcas-fudge-2223611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097964S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6355638","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355640,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Boero","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6363578/6355640/6355640-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristina Boero received the M.

In this study, the dynamic model of a vision-based mobile robot system, including a nonholonomic mobile robot and a tilt camera based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics, is developed first. Then, a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm is adopted for the moving-object detection, and a model-based conventional sliding-mode control (CSMC) strategy is introduced. In order to relax the control design dependent on detailed system information and alleviate chattering phenomena caused by the inappropriate selection of uncertainty bounds, it further designs a model-free AMTC scheme with a DPRFNN to imitate the CSMC strategy. In the DPRFNN, the concept of a Petri net and the recurrent frame of internal feedback loops are incorporated into a traditional fuzzy neural network to alleviate the computation burden of parameter learning and to enhance the dynamic mapping of network ability. This five-layer DPRFNN is utilized for the major role in the proposed AMTC scheme. The corresponding adaptation laws of network parameters are established in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence, as well as robust control performance without detailed system information and the compensation of auxiliary controllers. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AMTC scheme is verified by numerical simulations under different target tracking, and its superiority is indicated in comparison with the CSMC system. Furthermore, experimental results are also provided to verify the validity of the proposed AMTC scheme in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2227974","startPage":"688","endPage":"701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2227974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6572863/06355650.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Moving-Target Tracking Control of a Vision-Based Mobile Robot via a Dynamic Petri Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355650/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Moving-Target Tracking Control of a Vision-Based Mobile Robot via a Dynamic Petri Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Network","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6355650/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13692642","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Moving-Target Tracking Control of a Vision-Based Mobile Robot via a Dynamic Petri Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wai-2227974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134093S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6572863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6572863","articleId":"6355650","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355655,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Anand","id":"38013909100"},{"name":"B.

This paper analyzes the stability of low-voltage dc microgrid systems. Sources are controlled using a droop-based decentralized controller. Various components of the system have been modeled. A linearized system model is derived using small-signal approximation. The stability of the system is analyzed by identifying the eigenvalues of the system matrix. The sufficiency condition for stable operation of the system is derived. It provides upper bound on droop constants and is useful during planning and designing of dc microgrids. Furthermore, the sensitivity of system poles to variation in cable resistance and inductance is identified. It is proved that the poles move further inside the negative real plane with a decrease in inductance or an increase in resistance. The method proposed in this paper is applicable to any interconnecting structure of sources and loads. The results obtained by analysis are verified by detailed simulation study. Root locus plots are included to confirm the movement of system poles. The viability of the model is confirmed by experimental results from a scaled-down laboratory prototype of a dc microgrid developed for the purpose.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","volume":"60","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"13563582","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Order Model and Stability Analysis of Low-Voltage DC Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Order Model and Stability Analysis of Low-Voltage DC Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tie-anand-2227902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077404S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"199","articleId":"6355655","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6355656,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Andler","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile","Leistungselektronik, Elektrotechnisches Institut, Fakult\u00e4t Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6525345/6355656/6355656-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Andler (S'08) was born in Puerto Varas, Chile, in 1983.

Designers need to strike a delicate balance between these two because designing the link to achieve high PTE will degrade the PDL and vice versa. We are proposing a new figure-of-merit (FoM), which can help designers to find out whether a two-, three-, or four-coil link is appropriate for their particular application and guide them through an iterative design procedure to reach optimal coil geometries based on how they weigh the PTE versus PDL for that application. Three design examples at three different power levels have been presented based on the proposed FoM for implantable microelectronic devices, handheld mobile devices, and electric vehicles. The new FoM suggests that the two-coil links are suitable when the coils are strongly coupled, and a large PDL is needed. Three-coil links are the best when the coils are loosely coupled, the coupling distance varies considerably, and large PDL is necessary. Finally, four-coil links are optimal when the PTE is paramount, the coils are loosely coupled, and their relative distance and alignment are stable. Measurement results support the accuracy of the theoretical design procedure and conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2227914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2227914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6525345/06355662.pdf","startPage":"5292","endPage":"5305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Figure-of-Merit for Designing High-Performance Inductive Power Transmission Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Figure-of-Merit for Designing High-Performance Inductive Power Transmission Links","volume":"60","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355662/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13563587","pubMedId":"25382898","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355662/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Figure-of-Merit for Designing High-Performance Inductive Power Transmission Links","sourcePdf":"tie-ghovanloo-2227914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145702S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6525345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6525345","articleId":"6355662","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6355663,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Hwa Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6512583/6355663/6355663-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Hwa Kim (M'08) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1978.

This method can extract meaningful frequencies but cannot give accurate amplitude information of fault harmonics. In this paper, we propose a new frequency analysis of stator current to estimate fault-sensitive frequencies and their amplitudes for broken rotor bars (BRBs). The proposed method employs a frequency estimator, an amplitude estimator, and a fault decision module. The frequency estimator is implemented by a zoom technique and a high-resolution analysis technique known as the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques, which can extract frequencies accurately. For the amplitude estimator, a least squares estimator is derived to obtain amplitudes of fault harmonics, without frequency leakage. In the fault decision module, the fault diagnosis index from the amplitude estimator is used depending on the load conditions of the induction motors. The fault index and corresponding threshold are optimized by using the false alarm and detection probabilities. Experimental results obtained from induction motors show that the proposed diagnosis algorithm is capable of detecting BRB faults with an accuracy that is superior to the zoom-based MUSIC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2227912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2227912","startPage":"4103","endPage":"4117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6512583/06355663.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution Parameter Estimation Method to Identify Broken Rotor Bar Faults in Induction Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution Parameter Estimation Method to Identify Broken Rotor Bar Faults in Induction Motors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355663/","accessionNumber":"13484419","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355663/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution Parameter Estimation Method to Identify Broken Rotor Bar Faults in Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2227912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115525S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6512583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6512583","articleId":"6355663","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":6355667,"authors":[{"name":"Elias G.

Among these methods are redundancies and changes of topology, power levels, and control algorithms. Since diagnosis methods are imperfect, false positives and negatives, as well as delayed fault diagnosis, may occur. Although the diagnosis of a fault can lead to appropriate maintenance, the estimation of the time to failure through prognosis can lead to the timely mitigation of the fault and, in turn, can extend the lifetime and reliability of the drive. In this paper, we present a new approach to the mitigation of permanent-magnet ac motors that uses a failure prognosis method to predict failures and the remaining useful life and uses the output of the prognosis algorithm to decide when to modify the system and mitigate the fault. A methodology to calculate the mean time between failures with and without mitigation is also presented. The proposed approach is illustrated through a simple example of how the prognosis of failure due to a developing intermittent open circuit in one of the phases increases the drive reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13431030","htmlLink":"/document/6355667/","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Failure Prognosis and Mitigation on the Reliability of Permanent-Magnet AC Motor Drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Failure Prognosis and Mitigation on the Reliability of Permanent-Magnet AC Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-strangas-2227913-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096795S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6497104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6497104","articleId":"6355667","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355682,"authors":[{"name":"Pawe\u0142 Korus","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6421028/6355682/6355682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pawe\u0142 Korus (S'09) received the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in telecommunications from the AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Telecommunications.","He has actively participated in both national and international research projects, e.g., BONE, INDECT, and INSIGMA, since 2008.

Our paper presents a theoretical analysis of the inherent restoration trade-offs. We analytically derive formulas for the reconstruction success bounds, and validate them experimentally with Monte Carlo simulations and a reference image authentication system. We perform an exhaustive reconstruction quality assessment, where the presented reference scheme is compared to five state-of-the-art alternatives in a common evaluation scenario. Our paper leads to important insights on how self-embedding schemes should be constructed to achieve optimal performance. The reference authentication system designed according to the presented principles allows for high-quality reconstruction, regardless of the amount of the tampered content. The average reconstruction quality, measured on 10000 natural images is 37 dB, and is achievable even when 50% of the image area becomes tampered.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2227769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2227769","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6421028/06355682.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Method for Content Reconstruction With Self-Embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Method for Content Reconstruction With Self-Embedding","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355682/","accessionNumber":"13256711","pubMedId":"23193455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355682/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Method for Content Reconstruction With Self-Embedding","sourcePdf":"tip-korus-2227769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073854S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6421028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6421028","articleId":"6355682","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6355683,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Laboratory of Mathematics and Complex Systems, Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6421028/6355683/6355683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Liu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computational mathematics from Beijing Normal University (BNU), Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","He was with the Hunan Institute of the Humanities, Science and Technology, Changsha, from 2004 to 2005.

The approach is built upon maximum likelihood estimation framework and sparse representations over a trained dictionary. Rather than optimizing the likelihood functional derived from a mixture distribution, we present a new weighting data fidelity function, which has the same minimizer as the original likelihood functional but is much easier to optimize. The weighting function in the model can be determined by the algorithm itself, and it plays a role of noise detection in terms of the different estimated noise parameters. By incorporating the sparse regularization of small image patches, the proposed method can efficiently remove a variety of mixed or single noise while preserving the image textures well.

The scheme is based on a block-Markov strategy combining the Marton scheme and a lossy version of the Gray-Wyner scheme with side information. In each block, the transmitter sends fresh data and update information that allows the receivers to improve the channel outputs observed in the previous block. For a generalization of Dueck's broadcast channel, our scheme achieves the noiseless-feedback capacity, which is strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity. For a generalization of Blackwell's channel and when the feedback is noiseless, our new scheme achieves rate points that are outside the no-feedback capacity region. It follows by a simple continuity argument that for both these channels and when the feedback noise is sufficiently low, our scheme improves on the no-feedback capacity even when the feedback is noisy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06355689.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2227670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2227670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of the Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channel With Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Noise measurement","Encoding","Transmitters","Decoding","Random variables","Random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","channel coding","feedback","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete memoryless broadcast channel capacity","generalized feedback","block-Markov strategy","Marton scheme","Gray-Wyner scheme","side information","transmitter","Dueck broadcast channel generalization","noiseless-feedback capacity","Blackwell channel generalization","no-feedback capacity region","continuity argument","feedback noise","distributed source coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channel","channel capacity","distributed source coding","feedback","source coding with side-information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of the Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channel With Feedback","volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13307132","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of the Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Channel With Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-shayevitz-2227670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04198S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","articleId":"6355689","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355691,"authors":[{"name":"Hassen Fourati","affiliation":["GIPSA-Lab, University of Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6716101/6355691/6355691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassen Fourati received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the National Engineering School of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia, the M.A. degree in automated systems and control from the University of Claude Bernard, Lyon, France, and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from the University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France, in 2006, 2007, and 2010, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France, and a member of the Networked Controlled Systems Team (NeCS), affiliated with the GIPSA-LAB laboratory.

We claim that this approach is an alternative one to overcome the limitations of the extended Kalman filter. The CO processes data from a small inertial/magnetic sensor module containing triaxial angular rate sensors, accelerometers, and magnetometers, without resorting to GPS data. The proposed algorithm incorporates a motion kinematic model and adopts a two-layer filter architecture. In the latter, the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm preprocesses acceleration and local magnetic field measurements, to produce what will be called the system's output. The system's output together with the angular rate measurements will become measurement signals for the CO. In this way, the overall CO design is greatly simplified. The efficiency of the CO is experimentally investigated through an industrial robot and a commercial IMU during human segment motion exercises. These results are promising for human motion applications, in particular future ambulatory monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14040729","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6355691/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Complementary Observer for Body Segments Motion Capturing by Inertial and Magnetic Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary Observer for Body Segments Motion Capturing by Inertial and Magnetic Sensors","sourcePdf":"tmech-manamanni-2225151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071349S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6716101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6716101","articleId":"6355691","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355694,"authors":[{"name":"Jaison Mathew","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6355694/6355694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaison Mathew (S\u201996\u2013M\u201902) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology Kottayam, Kottayam, India, in 1998, and the M.Tech. degree in power systems from the College of Engineering Trivandrum, Trivandrum, India, in 2001.

This paper presents a new topology suitable for the realization of such multilevel inverter schemes for induction motor (IM) drives, by cascading two-level inverters with flying-capacitor-inverter fed floating H-bridge cells. Now, any standard IM may be used to get the dodecagonal operation which hitherto was possible only with open-end winding IM. To minimize the current total harmonic distortion (THD), a strategy for synchronous PWM is also proposed. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of obtaining better THD figures, compared to conventional dodecagonal schemes. The topology and the PWM strategy are validated through analysis and subsequently verified experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6415310/06355694.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415310","startPage":"3723","endPage":"3732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Multilevel Inverter System Based on Dodecagonal Space Vectors for Medium Voltage IM Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Multilevel Inverter System Based on Dodecagonal Space Vectors for Medium Voltage IM Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13244999","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6355694/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Multilevel Inverter System Based on Dodecagonal Space Vectors for Medium Voltage IM Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-gopakumar-2227978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119027S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6355694","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355695,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Hayati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6355695/6355695-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Hayati received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Nagarjuna University, Andhra Pradesh, India, in 1985, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Delhi University, Delhi, India, in 1987 and 1992, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah,Iran, as an Assistant Professor in 1993 where he is currently an Associate Professor with the same department.

The subnominal condition means that only the zero-current switching condition (ZCS) is achieved, though the nominal conditions mean that both the ZCS and zero-current derivative switching (ZCDS) are satisfied. The design values for achieving the subnominal condition are expressed as a function of the phase shift between the input and output voltages. The class-E amplifier with subnominal condition increases one design degree of freedom compared with that with the nominal conditions. Because of the increase in the design degree of freedom, one more relationship can be specified as a design specification. It is shown analytically that the dc-supply voltage and the current are always proportional to the amplitude of the output voltage and the current as a function of the phase shift. Additionally, the output power capability is affected by the phase shift, and the peak switch voltage has influence on the phase shift as well. This paper gives a circuit design example based on our proposed design expression by specifying the peak switch voltage instead of the ZCDS condition. The measurement and PSpice simulation results agree with the analytical expressions quantitatively, which show the validity of our analytical expressions.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415310","startPage":"3834","endPage":"3844","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6415310/06355695.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Study of Class-E Power Amplifier With a Shunt Inductor at Subnominal Condition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Zero current switching","Power amplifiers","Shunts (electrical)","Inductors","Zero voltage switching","MOSFET circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power inductors","SPICE","zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-e power amplifier","shunt inductor","subnominal condition","zero-current switching condition","ZCS","zero-current derivative switching","phase shift","input voltages","output voltages","degree of freedom","nominal conditions","dc-supply voltage","output power capability","peak switch voltage","PSpice simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E power amplifier","peak switch voltage","power conversion efficiency","shunt inductor","subnominal","zero-current derivative switching (ZCDS)","zero-current switching (ZCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance Study of Class-E Power Amplifier With a Shunt Inductor at Subnominal Condition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6355695/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13245000","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Study of Class-E Power Amplifier With a Shunt Inductor at Subnominal Condition","sourcePdf":"tpel-hayati-2227814-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078849S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6355695","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355696,"authors":[{"name":"Mario A.

First, a nonlinear dead-time disturbance model is reviewed, which is then used for the generation of a feed-forward compensation signal that eliminates the current distortion associated with current clamping effects around zero-current crossing points. A novel closed-loop adaptive adjustment scheme is proposed for fine tuning in real time the compensation model parameters, thereby ensuring accurate results even under the highly varying operating conditions typically found in PV systems due to insolation, temperature, and shadowing effects, among others. The algorithm implementation is straightforward and computationally efficient, and can be easily attached to an existent PCC to enhance its dead-time rejection capability without modifying its internal structure. Experimental results with a 5-kW PV system prototype are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Adaptation models","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Current control","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","compensation","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive dead-time compensation","grid-connected PWM inverters","single-stage PV systems","software-based plug-in dead-time compensator","grid-connected pulsewidth modulated voltage-source inverters","single-stage photovoltaic systems","nonlinear dead-time disturbance model","feed-forward compensation signal","zero-current crossing points","closed-loop adaptive adjustment scheme","compensation model parameters","PCC","PV system","power 5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current-controlled voltage-source inverter (CC-VSI)","dead-time compensation","grid-connected pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverter","harmonic distortion","predictive current control (PCC)","single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6376188/06355696.pdf","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation for Grid-Connected PWM Inverters of Single-Stage PV Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation for Grid-Connected PWM Inverters of Single-Stage PV Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355696/","volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355696/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13167911","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation for Grid-Connected PWM Inverters of Single-Stage PV Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-herran-2227811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093963S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6355696","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6355697,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Da","affiliation":["Regal Beloit Corporation, Fort Wayne, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6355697/6355697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao Da (S\u201908) received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Power Electronics Design Engineer with Regal Beloit Corporation, Fort Wayne, IN.

Unlike other spectrum-based fault detection schemes, only the fundamental frequency component of the measured voltage is utilized for fault detection. Therefore, the performance of the proposed scheme is not affected by nonstationary speed or harmonics introduced by the power supply. In addition, location of interturn short circuits and direction of static eccentricity can be detected, which have never been done by any other scheme. In spite of the invasive nature of the technique, it is very suitable for mission-critical applications and emerging applications such as off-shore wind turbines, hybrid vehicle technology, and military applications, where early detection of faults is of paramount importance. 2-D simulations using finite element analysis have been presented to validate the proposed method under different operating conditions. Experimental introduction of stator interturn short circuit, demagnetization, and static eccentricity has been discussed, and the proposed scheme is experimentally implemented to examine its effectiveness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6415310/06355697.pdf","startPage":"4104","endPage":"4112","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2227808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Fault Diagnostics for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Electromagnetic Signature Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Fault Diagnostics for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Electromagnetic Signature Analysis","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6355697/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13245001","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Fault Diagnostics for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Electromagnetic Signature Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpel-krishnamurthy-2227808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07977S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6355697","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":6355698,"authors":[{"name":"David Meneses","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6376188/6355698/6355698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Meneses (S\u201910) was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1982.

In a departure from existing works in the literature that considered resource allocation for either an overlay spectrum access mechanism (OSAM) or an underlay spectrum access mechanism (USAM), we propose subcarrier-and-power-allocation schemes for a joint overlay and underlay spectrum access mechanism (JOUSAM). In particular, for such a CR system, the total transmission rate of CR users is maximized for a given power budget while keeping the interference introduced to the primary-user (PU) receivers' below given thresholds with a certain probability. As the optimal scheme can be highly complex, we also propose a low-complexity suboptimal subcarrier-and-power-allocation scheme. The selected numerical results show that a significant gain in terms of total achievable transmission rate can be obtained over an USAM or an OSAM. These selected numerical results also show that the proposed suboptimal scheme, which has a very low complexity, provides a significant improvement in performance over either underlay or overlay spectrum access mechanism. The proposed optimal scheme can lead to an unfairness among CR users in sharing the total transmission rate; therefore, we also propose a suboptimal subcarrier-allocation scheme that can guarantee a certain level of fairness among CR users.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2227856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06355702.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2227856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier and Power Allocation for OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Systems With Joint Overlay and Underlay Spectrum Access Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355702/","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier and Power Allocation for OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Systems With Joint Overlay and Underlay Spectrum Access Mechanism","volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13382380","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355702/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier and Power Allocation for OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Systems With Joint Overlay and Underlay Spectrum Access Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tvt-bansal-2227856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149275S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6479353","articleId":"6355702","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355703,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo A.

It will turn one's house or neighborhood grid into a smart grid. PLC has some issues, namely, high noise at low frequencies and varying characteristic impedance. This paper addresses these issues to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by increasing the signal or reducing the noise. PLC MODEMs are subject to legislations that limit the signals in the line. The radiated signal is proportional to the current, but not to the input current, since the current forms a standing wave along the line. However, better performance can be achieved if the input current is measured. The receiver circuit of the transmitting MODEM can be used to estimate the input impedance. This paper presents a technique to use this new information to achieve better performance and to follow legislation changes in the band above 30 MHz. A study of the viability of using impulsive noise reduction techniques to further increase performance is also presented. The short noise pulses result in high correlation between the noises in different carriers. Impulse position detection should result in an increase in capacity.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6389787/06355703.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"66","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2214065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2214065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dealing With Unknown Impedance and Impulsive Noise in the Power-Line Communications Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Dealing With Unknown Impedance and Impulsive Noise in the Power-Line Communications Channel","htmlLink":"/document/6355703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188748","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dealing With Unknown Impedance and Impulsive Noise in the Power-Line Communications Channel","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-lopes-2214065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05524S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6389787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6389787","articleId":"6355703","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355732,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Riccardi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Process Automation, Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6623119/6355732/6355732-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Riccardi received the Master's degree from the Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy, in 2008, where he received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Science, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Process Automation, Saarland University, Saarbr\u00fcecken, Germany, in 2012.","His current research interests include control of innovative actuators based on active materials."]},"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Riccardi","id":"37592308300"},{"name":"David Naso","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Science, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6623119/6355732/6355732-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["David Naso was born in Salerno, Italy, on April 29, 1967.

HDFS provides high performance, reliability and availability by replicating data, typically three copies of every data. The data in HDFS changes in popularity over time. To get better performance and higher disk utilization, the replication policy of HDFS should be elastic and adapt to data popularity. In this paper, we describe ERMS, an elastic replication management system for HDFS. ERMS provides an active/standby storage model for HDFS. It utilizes a complex event processing engine to distinguish real-time data types, and then dynamically increases extra replicas for hot data, cleans up these extra replicas when the data cool down, and uses erasure codes for cold data. ERMS also introduces a replica placement strategy for the extra replicas of hot data and erasure coding parities. The experiments show that ERMS effectively improves the reliability and performance of HDFS and reduce storage overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ClusterW.2012.25","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6354581/6355839/06355844.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ClusterW.2012.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ERMS: An Elastic Replication Management System for HDFS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"ERMS: An Elastic Replication Management System for HDFS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148693","htmlLink":"/document/6355844/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ERMS: An Elastic Replication Management System for HDFS","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4844a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076579S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6354581","isNumber":"6355839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6354581","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6355839","articleId":"6355844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355859,"authors":[{"name":"Kejiang Ye","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kejiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37528708800"},{"name":"Xiaohong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37277315100"},{"name":"Yanzhang He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanzhang","lastName":"He","id":"38514011200"},{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"38514434500"},{"name":"Haiming Yan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Yan","id":"38513977000"},{"name":"Peng Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38513989900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4844-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2893-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6355859","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":917},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Virtual machining","Monitoring","Machine learning","Parallel machines","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable hadoop virtual cluster platform","MapReduce based parallel machine learning","virtual infrastructure","virtualized cloud computing infrastructure","MapReduce based parallel data processing","vHadoop platform","cross domain hadoop virtual cluster","parallel clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hadoop","MapReduce","Virtual Cluster","Cloud Computing","Machine Learning","Big Data"]}],"abstract":"Big data processing is currently becoming increasingly important in modern era due to the continuous growth of the amount of data generated by various fields such as particle physics, human genomics, earth observation, etc. However, the efficiency of processing large-scale data on modern virtual infrastructure, especially on the virtualized cloud computing infrastructure, is not clear. This paper focuses on the performance of hadoop virtual cluster and proposes a scalable hadoop virtual cluster platform vHadoop for the large-scale MapReduce-based parallel data processing. We first describe the design and implementation of vHadoop platform. Then we perform a series of experiments to investigate both the static and dynamic performance of vHadoop platform, such as the performance characterization of cross-domain hadoop virtual cluster and live migraiton of hadoop virtual cluster. After that, we use the vHadoop platform to process 6 typical parallel clustering algorithms, such as Canopy, Dirichlet, Fuzzy k-Means, k-Means, Mean Shift, MinHash, etc, on two typical datasets. Experimental results verify the efficiency of vHadoop platform to process the MapReduce-based parallel machine learning applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"vHadoop: A Scalable Hadoop Virtual Cluster Platform for MapReduce-Based Parallel Machine Learning with Performance Consideration","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ClusterW.2012.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6354581/6355839/06355859.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ClusterW.2012.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"vHadoop: A Scalable Hadoop Virtual Cluster Platform for MapReduce-Based Parallel Machine Learning with Performance Consideration","conferenceDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355859/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148708","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"vHadoop: A Scalable Hadoop Virtual Cluster Platform for MapReduce-Based Parallel Machine Learning with Performance Consideration","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4844a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067922S","chronDate":"24-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6354581","isNumber":"6355839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6354581","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6355839","articleId":"6355859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6355931,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Martinez-Bauset","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Martinez-Bauset","id":"38529335100"},{"name":"Vicent Pla","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicent","lastName":"Pla","id":"37331147700"},{"name":"Jose R.

Simulations showed that PAPR reduction is achieved when compared to that of other existing filters for the interleaved subcarrier mode of single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6355935/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13169849","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction in SC-FDMA by Pulse Shaping Using Parametric Linear Combination Pulses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction in SC-FDMA by Pulse Shaping Using Parametric Linear Combination Pulses","sourcePdf":"2008-cl1212-azurdia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044404S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6380512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6380512","articleId":"6355935","onlineDate":"19 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355936,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Communications Technology Research Laboratory, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37067792400"},{"name":"Hui Shen","affiliation":["Communications Technology Research Laboratory, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Shen","id":"37405268200"},{"name":"David Tse","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tse","id":"37274371600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6355936","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":193,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":4192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Maximum likelihood decoding","Cyclic redundancy check","Error analysis","Iterative decoding","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","cyclic redundancy check codes","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive successive cancellation list decoder","polar codes","cyclic redundancy check codes","adaptive SC list decoder","CRC code","frame error rate","FER","information theoretic limit","word length 24 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","list decoder"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose an adaptive SC (Successive Cancellation)-List decoder for polar codes with CRC.

Based on direct conversion architecture, blocks in the transceiver can be configured to simultaneously support wavelength code-division multiple access (WCDMA) band I and four Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) bands (PCS/DCS/GSM900/GSM850). In the receiver path, the narrowband radio-frequency front-end is comprised of multiple-gated low-noise amplifiers with capacitive desensitization and current-mode passive mixers with the proposed second-order input intercept point (IIP2) calibration to comply for surface-acoustic-wave-less application. In the transmitter path, a high-linearity mixer and parallel Class-AB PA driver are adopted. Low-noise wideband frequency synthesizers with adaptive frequency calibration are proposed to cover all modes and bands. This reconfigurable transceiver achieves -5.6/-2/-6 dBm in-band third-order intercept point for WCDMA/GSM HB/GSM LB respectively, and >;65 dBm IIP2.

By separating out the bulk and interfacial effects, it is shown that the majority of the ionic movement in the cation-based analog memristor is at the interfaces. It is also shown that ionic capacitance results from a drift field-driven phase shift between the ac bias and the ionic motion, whereas the ionic inductance phase shift results from diffusion relaxation.

Three read schemes, namely, one bit-line pull-up (One-BLPU), all bit-line pull-up (All-BLPU), and partial bit-line pull-up (Partial-BLPU), are investigated. In contrast to the One-BLPU scheme, the All-BLPU scheme can realize a large crossbar array of 16 Mb, even when the line resistance is nonnegligible because the effective resistance at the sneak current path is substantially less sensitive to the array size. Additionally, the Partial-BLPU scheme can be used to reduce power consumption if random read access is desirable.

Numbers of prior NP control algorithms have been proven working well in terms of NP potential balancing. However, it seems that the impact of these algorithms on the ac side did not draw much attention in the past, e.g., some algorithms inject additional common mode voltages with considerable amplitude that may saturate the duty cycles or inject low-order harmonic currents into the ac load. As a consequence, compared with the original system without NP controls, the total harmonic distortion (THD) performance at the ac side becomes worse, i.e., the THD standards are violated and a redesign of the system (e.g., ac filter) may be essential. Therefore, particularly for industrial applications, low distortion and high margins for duty cycles are typically important criteria for designing an NP controller. In this paper, a novel NP controller with full power-factor (PF) range and low distortion is proposed, which has the minimum common voltage injection at no unbalance or slight unbalance conditions. On the other hand, at heavy unbalance conditions, the controller has the maximum balancing ability at any PFs. Its superior performance is summarized via a comparison between different NP controls in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6355984/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234788","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Neutral-Point Balancing Controller for a Three-Level Inverter With Full Power-Factor Range and Low Distortion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neutral-Point Balancing Controller for a Three-Level Inverter With Full Power-Factor Range and Low Distortion","sourcePdf":"tia-shen-2228615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06071S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6413287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6413287","articleId":"6355984","onlineDate":"19 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6355989,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-I Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6545313/6355989/6355989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-I Chen (S'07\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D. degree from National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi, Taiwan, in 2009.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

Nonetheless, this confidentiality does not guarantee their reliability in the presence of natural and malicious faults. In this paper, fault diagnosis schemes for the lightweight internationally standardized block cipher CLEFIA are proposed. This symmetric-key cipher is compatible with yet lighter in hardware than the Advanced Encryption Standard and enables the implementation of cryptographic functionality with low complexity and power consumption. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead.

The DFL technique detects the shadowed links and realizes localization with the received signal strength (RSS) measurements of these links. However, one major disadvantage of the DFL technique is that the RSS signal is too sensitive, and a slight variation of the environment will cause the variation of RSS measurements, which incurs the misjudgment of shadowed links and degradation of localization performance. To solve this problem, a robust DFL scheme based on differential RSS is proposed. The scheme utilizes the novel differential RSS to judge whether a link is shadowed, which not only eliminates the need of acquiring reference RSS measurements but also overcomes the negative effect incurred by the environment. Meanwhile, an outlier detection scheme is presented to filter out the outlier links that are far away from the target. We present the observation model of the shadowed links and incorporate it into the particle filter framework to realize location estimation robustly. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed scheme.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6355995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6545313/06355995.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2228145","startPage":"5943","endPage":"5952","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2228145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust Device-Free Wireless Localization Based on Differential RSS Measurements","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6355995/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13583298","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Device-Free Wireless Localization Based on Differential RSS Measurements","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2228145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120202S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6545313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6545313","articleId":"6355995","onlineDate":"19 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6355997,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Hua Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6355997/6355997-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Hua Chiang (S'12) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1984.

This is achieved by using a novel class of widely linear complex valued Kalman filters, which provide unbiased frequency estimation and are faster converging and more robust to noise and harmonic artifacts than the existing methods. It is shown that the Clarke's transformed three-phase voltage is circular for balanced systems and noncircular for unbalanced ones, making the proposed widely linear estimation perfectly suited both to identify the fault and to provide accurate estimation in unbalanced conditions, critical issues where standard models typically fail. The analysis and simulations show that the proposed model outperforms the recently introduced widely linear stochastic gradient-based frequency estimators, based on the augmented complex least mean square. Comprehensive simulations on synthetic and real-world power system data, in both balanced and unbalanced conditions, support the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2214953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2214953","startPage":"353","endPage":"363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6399626/06355999.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely Linear Modeling for Frequency Estimation in Unbalanced Three-Phase Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Widely Linear Modeling for Frequency Estimation in Unbalanced Three-Phase Power Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6355999/","accessionNumber":"13191339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6355999/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely Linear Modeling for Frequency Estimation in Unbalanced Three-Phase Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tim-dini-2214953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077908S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6399626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6399626","articleId":"6355999","onlineDate":"19 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6356002,"authors":[{"name":"Elia Conti","affiliation":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Perugia, Italy","University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Elia Conti was born in Citt\u00e0 della Pieve, Perugia, Italy, in 1986.

The authors present a novel approach to perform online monitoring of the staff during their interventions by using a device based on an Active Pixel Sensor. The performance of the sensor as an X-ray radiation detector has been evaluated with a proper experimental setup: the number of photons and the generated charge have been assessed as dosimetric observables from the frames acquired by the sensor using a two-threshold clustering algorithm, the efficiency of which has been evaluated as well. The correlation of these observables with passive dosimeter dose measurements has been analyzed: a good linearity has been demonstrated, and the response difference between pulsed and continuous operational modes is reduced to less than 10%, marking a distinct improvement with respect to commercial Active Personal Dosimeters.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2012.2223331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6493455/06356002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2223331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493455","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of a CMOS Image Sensor for an Active Personal Dosimeter in Interventional Radiology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of a CMOS Image Sensor for an Active Personal Dosimeter in Interventional Radiology","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13412858","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6356002/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of a CMOS Image Sensor for an Active Personal Dosimeter in Interventional Radiology","sourcePdf":"tim-placidi-2223331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094043S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6493455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6493455","articleId":"6356002","onlineDate":"19 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356005,"authors":[{"name":"Finbarr Waldron","affiliation":["University College Cork, Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6463474/6356005/6356005-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Finbarr Waldron received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering, in 1991, and the Higher Diploma degree in microelectronics from University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, in 1996.","He is currently a Senior Researcher with Tyndall National Institute (formerly National Microelectronics Research Centre - NMRC) at University College Cork, Ireland.

The results of this study are based on the identification of more than 28 commercial products, six of which were analyzed in detail, both physically and electrically. The methodology of the project is described and some of the salient results of this benchmarking effort are presented. In this study, a representative subset of the available commercial products was selected and a comprehensive physical, electrical and thermal performance analysis was carried out. The objectives were to identify the components, materials and assembly technologies used, and to determine if the drive toward greater integration and higher power density affected the performance of newer devices. The results of the analysis were then used to determine the current state of the technology in this application space, to show how it has developed to date and to predict how it might progress in the future. These results are presented in a generic format that does not identify individual products. This project was co-sponsored by the PSMA and member companies.

Therefore, a set of Cloud computing services and the networking services should be modeled as a composite customized Cloud service.

In this regard, data aggregation solutions have been developed; however, their actual usage has been limited, for the reason of low accuracy and high processing time.

Obviously, charger deployment is a critical issue since the number of chargers would be limited by the network construction budget, which makes the full-coverage deployment of chargers infeasible. In many of the applications targeted by large-scale wireless sensor networks, end-devices are usually equipped by the human and their movement follows some degree of regularity. Therefore in this paper, we utilize this property to deploy chargers with partial coverage, with an objective to maximize the survival rate of end-devices. We prove this problem is NP-hard, and propose an algorithm to tackle it. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly increase the survival rate of end-devices. To our knowledge, this is one of very first works that consider charger deployment with partial coverage in wireless rechargeable sensor networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility-aware charger deployment for wireless rechargeable sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2012 14th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2012.6356102","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 14th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338450/6356044/06356102.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2012.6356102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mobility-aware charger deployment for wireless rechargeable sensor networks","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356102/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13151580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility-aware charger deployment for wireless rechargeable sensor networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"99017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063353S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338450","isNumber":"6356044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338450","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6356044","articleId":"6356102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356161,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Bianca Pop","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristina Bianca","lastName":"Pop","id":"37395098500"},{"name":"Viorica Rozina Chifu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Viorica Rozina","lastName":"Chifu","id":"37394959900"},{"name":"Ioan Salomie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Salomie","id":"37324393200"},{"name":"Adela Negrean","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Adela","lastName":"Negrean","id":"37547676800"},{"name":"Horatiu Jeflea","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Horatiu","lastName":"Jeflea","id":"38519841800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2952-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2953-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6356161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356161","abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid bio-inspired algorithm that selects the optimal or a near-optimal solution in semantic Web service composition.

Access to sensitive information typically takes the form of copyright violations. To address this issue, owners typically employ different protection mechanisms. Many are weak (e.g., they have single points of failure), rendering them vulnerable to static analysis. Others are expensive to implement (e.g., they induce large performance penalties). In this paper we present a new method of protecting copyrighted material by using a locking mechanism based on artificial neural networks (ANN). Understanding the operation of a ANN is difficult as the knowledge is embedded in a complex, distributed, and sometimes self-contradictory form. The security of our system is based on replacing the decryption function of the protected information with a semantically equivalent artificial neural network. We designed the system so as to eliminate single points of failure and allow for retroactive key generations for the same protected material. This allows a many-to-one relationship between the keys and the encryption. The protection offered by our mechanism is resilient to reverse engineering and static analysis. We also describe a methodology for creating these types of locking mechanisms and also evaluate the proposed system based on several properties.","doi":"10.1109/ICCP.2012.6356165","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337026/6356140/06356165.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCP.2012.6356165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing software locking mechanisms against reverse engineering, using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Designing software locking mechanisms against reverse engineering, using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13152436","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356165/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing software locking mechanisms against reverse engineering, using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","sourcePdf":"ICCP2012083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076248S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337026","isNumber":"6356140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337026","xplore-issue":"6356140","articleId":"6356165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356199,"authors":[{"name":"Viorica Rozina Chifu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Viorica Rozina","lastName":"Chifu","id":"37394959900"},{"name":"Cristina Bianca Pop","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Cristina Bianca","lastName":"Pop","id":"37395098500"},{"name":"Ioan Salomie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Salomie","id":"37324393200"},{"name":"Izabella Balla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Izabella","lastName":"Balla","id":"38519046600"},{"name":"Ramona Paven","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ramona","lastName":"Paven","id":"38517849800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2952-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2953-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6356199","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Simulated annealing","Particle swarm optimization","Biological system modeling","Birds","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","data mining","particle swarm optimisation","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization method","process mining","bio-inspired hybrid method","near-optimal business process model","event log","simulated annealing","execution time","model quality","fitness function","evaluation criteria","model completeness","model preciseness","PROM framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356199","abstract":"This paper presents a bio-inspired hybrid method that extracts the optimal or a near-optimal business process model from an event log.

One of the main considerations in stability analysis is the low-frequency oscillations of rotor due to disturbances of which the power system is susceptible to. These oscillations may sustain and grow in magnitude to cause system separation if adequate damping is not provided, especially during using an AVR in the system. To enhance system damping, the generating unit is equipped with a power system stabilizer (PSS). Conventional PSS controllers are widely utilized in industry to damp the low-frequency inertial oscillations experienced due to disturbances. The design of such stabilizer encompasses finding the best settings of PSS parameters which yield the attainable damping response. Several design approaches and techniques have been proposed (i.e. sequential PSS design, Ha>; optimization technique, etc.) over the years. A novel genetic-algorithm (GA) based optimization approach to design a robust PSS is presented in this paper. This proposed approach employs optimization of damping factor (\u03c3) and damping ratio () in parallel with speed deviation based performance index (IAE) optimization, to obtain the best possible time-domain results (minimum settling time, ss\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">error</sub>\n, etc.). The well-known single-machine infinite bus system is used here. Simulation of the linearized system is presented. The system speed response is investigated with and without PSS. Their results are compared and show that the response of the system with PSS sustains its stability during system upsets, which means that the proposed method gives encouraging results compared with traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356625","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333778/6355888/06356625.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system stabilizer design using real-coded genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power system stabilizer design using real-coded genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13151321","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6356625/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system stabilizer design using real-coded genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053911S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356631,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Hosseini","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Urmia university, Urmia, Iran","Engineering Department of Urmia, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"38466183600"},{"name":"Behrooz Tusi","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Urmia university, Urmia, Iran","Engineering Department of Urmia, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Tusi","id":"38522466100"},{"name":"Navid Razmjooy","affiliation":["Young Researchers club, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran","Young Researchers club, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Razmjooy","id":"38523232200"},{"name":"Mohsen Khalilpoor","affiliation":["Young Researchers club, Ardabil branch, Ardabil, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Khalilpoor","id":"38519091800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1690-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1689-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1688-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6356631","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Power system stability","Oscillators","Generators","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Thyristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","damping","genetic algorithms","oscillations","particle swarm optimisation","power system control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum design","PSS controller","SVC controller","damping","low frequency oscillation","LFO","electrical energy","power system","particle swarm optimization","PSO","genetic algorithm","GA","PID controllers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356631","abstract":"Progressing of the demand for electrical energy leads to loading the transmission system close to their limits which may leads to LFO happening. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) in power system usuallyhappen because of lack of damping torque to overcome disturbances in power system such as changes in mechanical power. Due to the existence of the low frequency oscillation (LFO), the transmission power of AC lines is limited and the system angle stability is affected. In this paper the Parameters of the classic PSS and SVC internal AC and DC voltage controllers are designed in order to damp the Low Frequency Oscillations (LFO). The design of PSS and SVC parameters is considered as an optimization problem and Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used for searching optimized parameters. The results of the simulation show that the SVC with PID controllers is more effective in damping LFO compared to PSS with PID controllers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356631","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333778/6355888/06356631.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum design of PSS and SVC controller for damping low frequency oscillation (LFO)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimum design of PSS and SVC controller for damping low frequency oscillation (LFO)","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356631/","accessionNumber":"13151327","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356631/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum design of PSS and SVC controller for damping low frequency oscillation (LFO)","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047527S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6356665,"authors":[{"name":"M.

There are many applications which require a variable output voltage commanded by an external reference signal. So, the Zeta converters can be particularly useful for such applications. To achieve a Zeta converter with adjustable output voltage capable of following an external reference signal smoothly and accurately, there will be a need for a suitable control system. Since the Zeta converter model that is used in this paper is nonlinear, we propose a combination scheme of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with neural networks (NN). In this paper, we propose and design a neural network adaptive model reference controller to control the output voltage of Zeta converter.

In the presence of uncertainties, especially under noisy and external disturbances, interval type-2 fuzzy system can be helpful in approximating unknown nonlinear system functions. To achieve more efficiency, the proposed controller is designed to use the targeted combination of sliding mode as a robust controller, interval type-2 fuzzy system as a universal approximator, and adaptive control law as an online parameter's tuner. The interval type-2 adaptation law is derived using Lyapunov approach, and mathematical analysis proves the closed loop system to be asymptotically stable. Although stability of the controller is provided via Lyapunov approach, optimization is required for performance improvement. Genetic algorithm (GA), as a population-based approach, is then used to optimize the parameters of the interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. Simulation analysis shows that the optimized IT2FSMC can reach improved performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356731","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333778/6355888/06356731.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode control using Genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode control using Genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13151425","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6356731/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode control using Genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082583S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356734,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Fault detection and diagnosis in the early stages of damage are necessary to prevent their malfunctioning and failure during operation. Vibration monitoring is the most widely used and cost-effective monitoring technique to detect, locate and distinguish faults in rolling element bearings. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to extract optimizing features. The method employs capability features as well as the Bees Algorithm to obtain faults detection accurately and separably. This work presents an algorithm using optimum radial basis neural network by the use of the Bees Algorithm for automated diagnosis of localized faults in rolling element bearings. Optimum complementary capability values extracted from time-domain vibration signals are used as input features for the neural network. Optimum radial basis trained neural network are able to classify different states of the bearing with 100% accuracy. The proposed procedure requires only a few input features. Effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using the bearing vibration data obtained experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356756","startPage":"764","endPage":"769","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and

In this technique the mechanism of squeeze film damping is used. A voltage is applied to a fixed-fixed MEMS beam and its step response is obtained; for each pressure there is a different response. Then the settling time is measured and we can relate each settling time with a defined pressure. Here, first we use some equations to relate pressure with the squeeze film damping effect; after that we use a micro beam model and relate its parameters with pressure. Then we use numerical analysis and simulation to show the procedure of pressure measuring. All simulation results are shown and discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356763","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333778/6355888/06356763.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"803","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing a new pressure measurement mechanism based on squeeze film damping effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Developing a new pressure measurement mechanism based on squeeze film damping effect","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6356763/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"13151454","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356763/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a new pressure measurement mechanism based on squeeze film damping effect","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042494S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6356774,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Mesgari","affiliation":["Dept. of Mechanical Eng., K.

This structure provides robust stability against constant delay and guarantee position and force tracking. The proposed controller employ a stable neural network in each side to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the robot dynamics, thereby overcoming some limitation of adaptive control and guarantee good performance. An adaptation algorithm is developed to train the NN controller in order to stabilize the whole system. Furthermore, it is demonstrate that the tracking error of desired trajectory and NN weights are bounded.

This method formulates the inverse kinematics problem as an optimization algorithm, solves it using the SGA in two steps and can be extended further. The advantage of splitting the procedure can be beneficial when procedures execute in parallel. At the first step, the SGA looks for successive joint values set for a given manipulator as candidate joints set, and at the second one, SGA would find the optimum joint values.

This is achieved by adjusting the orifice diameters of four air dampers using a microprocessor-based controller which is interfaced with the bridge prototype using appropriate sensors and actuators. The embedded controller accepts user-defined damping coefficients as inputs and provides position commands to drive four servomotors that change orifice diameters of the dampers. The system identifies the damping coefficient using a least-squares method using displacement data collected by the load cells. The controller identifies nonlinear characteristics of the orifice damper in terms of the size of the orifice and its corresponding damping coefficient using a 3-layer neural-network. Based on that, a mapping is obtained between the orifice diameter and corresponding damping characteristics which is used to tune the system to achieve a desired damping. Details of embedded control software are presented and performance of the system is investigated using experimental evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6356807/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"13151494","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of an embedded controller for a tunable damper system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of an embedded controller for a tunable damper system","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059555S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356817,"authors":[{"name":"Afsaneh Ghadirian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology (IUT), Isfahan, IRAN"],"firstName":"Afsaneh","lastName":"Ghadirian","id":"38518370600"},{"name":"Maryam Zekri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology (IUT), Isfahan, IRAN"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Zekri","id":"37397762800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1690-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1689-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1688-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6356817","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","learning systems","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear dynamical systems","recurrent neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO nonlinear dynamic systems identification","fully recurrent wavelet neural network","multiinput multioutput nonlinear dynamic systems identification","fast convergence","localization properties","MIMO FRWNN","single-input single-output system","SISO","real time recurrent learning algorithm","RTRL algorithm","network connection weights"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we expand a fully recurrent wavelet neural network (FRWNN) for the multi-input multioutput (MIMO) nonlinear dynamic systems identification.

Here, we use the MIMO FRWNN to identify the single-input single-output (SISO) and MIMO nonlinear dynamic systems. The real time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm is applied to adjust the shape of wavelet functions and the connection weights of the network. The simulation results verify that the FRWNN is capable of accurately identifying nonlinear dynamic systems and can rapidly get the dynamical performance. Also in this paper, the FRWNN is compared with a fully recurrent neural network (FRNN) that the structures of both are similar.

In this paper, a least square based so-called Vector Fitting method is developed to identify parameters of a time-delayed system. The Vector Fitting (V.F.) algorithm efficiently directs evolution of parameters of a model towards their optimal values, iteratively. During each iteration poles of the model are calculated and replaced as starting poles for the next generation. The proposed algorithm is then combined with a heuristic optimization method, i.e. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to provide a hybrid technique, leading to identify delay time (r) of the system. The hybrid algorithm works in two stages; primarily the delay parameter is estimated using particle swarm optimization. The Vector fitting algorithm identifies the remaining parameters in the second stage. These two stages will be performed iteratively until the termination criterion is reached. Illustrative cases especially in presence of white noisy data are given to show the validity and the significance of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356826/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13151512","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356826/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization and vector fitting based identification algorithm in a time-delayed systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid particle swarm optimization and vector fitting based identification algorithm in a time-delayed systems","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071719S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356830,"authors":[{"name":"Jouhar Papari","affiliation":["Department of Communication, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Jouhar","lastName":"Papari","id":"38517621200"},{"name":"H.

However, the performance of adaptive beamforming techniques may degrade severely in the presence of mismatches between the presumed and actual signal steering vectors. This problem can be overcome by neural network approach. In this paper we propose a Sampling Function Neural Network (SFNN) - based robust adaptive beamforming algorithm, which treats the problem of computing the weights of an adaptive array antenna as a mapping problem. This ANN is combination of the Sinc Function in signal processing theory and RBF neural network configuration. This algorithm provides excellent robustness to signal steering vector mismatches, enhances the array system performance under non ideal conditions and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Computer simulations results show better performance of our algorithm as compared with existing adaptive beamforming algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356830","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333778/6355888/06356830.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6355888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAutom.2011.6356830","publicationTitle":"The 2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation and Automation","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming algorithm based on Sampling Function Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming algorithm based on Sampling Function Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356830/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"13151516","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming algorithm based on Sampling Function Neural Network","confLoc":"Shiraz, Iran","sourcePdf":"210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080999S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6333778","isNumber":"6355888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333778","xplore-issue":"6355888","articleId":"6356830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6356853,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Huang","id":"38520266500"},{"name":"Xinxin Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Feng","id":"38515610000"},{"name":"Hang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"38521163600"},{"name":"Xinbing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinbing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375300"},{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37536937000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356853","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356853","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cascading style sheets","Energy consumption","Heuristic algorithms","Equations","Channel capacity","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","heuristic programming","probability","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient cooperative sensing scheduling","cognitive radio networks","CSS problem","CRN","primary users","secondary users","PU channels","channel admission control","idle probability","channel capacity","sensing energy consumption","heuristic algorithms","centralized algorithm","multioligarch algorithm","revised initialization algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356853","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356853.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient Cooperative Sensing Schedule for heterogenous users in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we study the Cooperative Sensing Scheduling (CSS) problem for Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), from the perspective of balance between sensing performance and energy consumption.

However, these wireless technologies suffer from signal distortion and short Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS). Furthermore, in underground disaster it is difficult to transmit sensing data to the ground via wireless signals. In this paper, we study beamforming based signal strengthening scheme in underground wireless sensor networks. Compare with traditional wireless signals, we use acoustic signal, which has several merits: first, it has much longer wavelength, which results to slower decay and longer propagation distance; second, it is resistant to signal distortion, which may help enhance the robustness of the underground monitoring system. Theoretical analysis is provided on both systematic and stochastic errors. Extensive simulations are carried out for theoretical verification.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","startPage":"36","endPage":"40","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356859.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming based signal strengthening via underground acoustics sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356859/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming based signal strengthening via underground acoustics sensor networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148997","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming based signal strengthening via underground acoustics sensor networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"m1569628939yan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079375S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6356862,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Hassan","affiliation":["Transmission Systems Group (TrSyS), Center for Advanced Systems Engineering, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany","Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37901462200"},{"name":"Alexandra Filip","affiliation":["Transmission Systems Group (TrSyS), Center for Advanced Systems Engineering, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Filip","id":"38523590500"},{"name":"Werner Henkel","affiliation":["Transmission Systems Group (TrSyS), Center for Advanced Systems Engineering, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37326251000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356862","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Quality of service","Multiaccess communication","OFDM","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive multiuser MIMO-OFDM QoS-based scheduler","virtual channel state information","user channel measurements","noncodebook based beamformers","infeasible users","optimal users","virtual signal-to-noise ratio","vSNR","noninterfering users","total power constraint","equivalent SINR constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS","MU-MIMO","OFDM","Non-orthogonal SDMA","SNR","SINR","SINR/Rate Outage probability"]}],"abstract":"We propose an adaptive multiuser QoS-based scheduler based on the users' channel measurements.

This is computed assuming non-interfering users and a total power constraint. Solely depending on vSNR, we obtain thresholds that fulfill the equivalent SINR constraints for a different number of users. In this paper, vSNR thresholds are utilized to develop a fast adaptive multiuser scheduling routine.

Differing from existing results which mainly describe various asymptotic properties, this paper gives analytical formulas of estimating pair-wise error probabilities (PEP) of ZF and MMSE decoders for given parameters M, K (number of users), and \u03c1 (Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR). Furthermore, a formula estimating MMSE decoder dB gain over ZF decoder is given. Based on this formula, an analytical formula calculating the gain when \u03c1 goes to infinite is also presented, which is almost the same as one given in the paper.

However, the spectrum allocation problem of the femtocell network is challenging for the wireless operator, since the added femtocell tier either requires additional spectrum resource or brings interference to the existing cellular network. In this paper, we consider the methods of spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing to improve the capacity performance of femtocell networks. We first propose a spectrum allocation strategy that utilizes the structure of the cellular network to reduce interference. Then, we propose a spectrum sharing scheme that deals with the problem of insufficient channels for femtocells. Adjacent femtocells could coordinate with each other for resource allocation by taking the instantaneous traffic demand into consideration. Finally, the proposed spectrum management methods are compared with several conventional methods and the improvements of the proposed schemes are verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356866","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","startPage":"132","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved spectrum management scheme for OFDMA femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved spectrum management scheme for OFDMA femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356866/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149004","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356866/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved spectrum management scheme for OFDMA femtocell networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p132feng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055531S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356877,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38523864300"},{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyang","lastName":"Song","id":"37288632100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356877","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Approximation methods","Encoding","Protocols","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","amplify and forward communication","encoding","error statistics","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","two-way amplify-and-forward relay network","coding protocol","all-participate amplify-and-forward relay network","signal amplification","feedback channel","block error rate","BLER","Rayleigh channel","spectral efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356877","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356877.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive modulation and coding for two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an adaptive modulation and coding protocol for all-participate amplify-and-forward relay network systems to achieve a better overall system performance. In the proposed scheme, all the relays are available and have chances to amplify and forward (AF) the signal candidates to the terminals, and for fairness all the relays submit to the same power limitation for the signal amplification. The two source nodes adaptively choose the appropriate modulation and coding scheme based on the information from the feedback channels to ensure that the block error rate (BLER) of the relay system is under the system requirement. Furthermore, we derive closed form expressions for the system performances over Rayleigh Channels, including average spectral efficiency and average BLER. Numerical results show that the analytical results figure out the system performance asymptotically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356877/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation and coding for two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation and coding for two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p197yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059545S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6356878,"authors":[{"name":"Renyong Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Renyong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37405293900"},{"name":"Xue Deng","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Deng","id":"38518316300"},{"name":"Rongxing Lu","affiliation":["Department of electrical and computer engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Rongxing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37309741500"},{"name":"Xuemin Shen","affiliation":["Department of electrical and computer engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuemin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37278603300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356878","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust based anomaly detection","wireless sensor networks","wireless media","sensor nodes","data credibility","network reliability","fuzzy theory","evidence theory","trust model","malicious nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","trust assessment","fuz\u00e7y theory","evidence theory"]}],"abstract":"Due to the openness of the wireless media and frequent interactions among sensor nodes, security has been tightly related to the data credibility and network reliability in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

The attractive features include data-plane provisioning in addition to traditional transmission-pipe functionality, a new way to subsidize access network deployment investment, as well as high-speed fiber optic resource virtualization. We investigate this new architecture's feasibility by studying PON processing, storage and interconnection capabilities. Based on the feasibility study, we further explore the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provisioning over PONs. The PON cloud performance is evaluated from two aspects: compute capability and storage capacity. Detailed analysis shows that cloud capability is determined by the PON configuration. Relevant parameters are ONU memory capacity, ONU CPU processing capability, OLT memory capacity, OLT CPU processing capability, PON port split, PON port density, OLT card density. Our result shows that PON cloud is an attractive value-added implementation of high-speed optic-fiber access systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356888","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE

However, in traditional IA schemes, the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) may decrease greatly when the desired signal and the interference are aligned in the similar directions by IA. Consequently, the bit error rate (BER) will be large, and the quality of service (QoS) can become unacceptable. In this paper, a novel IA scheme based on antenna switching at the receivers is proposed to improve the SINR of the received signal, and guarantee the QoS in IA wireless networks. In the proposed scheme, one reconfigurable antenna is equipped at each receiver to switch between two modes, and the best channel coefficients are selected to maximize the minimal SINR of the desired signal of all the receivers. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed IA scheme can significantly improve the QoS of IA wireless networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356898","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356898.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"311","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment through antenna switching to improve quality of service in wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment through antenna switching to improve quality of service in wireless networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149036","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356898/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment through antenna switching to improve quality of service in wireless networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p307zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062507S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356901,"authors":[{"name":"Min Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38247520100"},{"name":"Min Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Dong","id":"37402785200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356901","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356901","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power control","Array signal processing","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cooperative communication","optimal control","phase coding","power control","radio networks","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed relay beamforming network","relay power constraint","cooperative relay network","SNR","phase-only codebook","Grassmannian line packing criterion","equal gain constraint","optimal codebook design","generalized Lloyd algorithm","low-complexity suboptimal method","perfect channel knowledge","optimal power control solution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356901","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356901.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On codebook design for distributed relay beamforming network","abstract":"We study the problem of codebook design for quantized distributed relay beamforming under individual relay power constraint in a cooperative relay network. The received SNR is used as the design metric. We study two types of codebook design: phase-only codebook where each relay uses full power, and codebook with power control where relay power and phase need to be jointly considered. For the former, we adopt Grassmannian line packing criterion under equal gain constraint, and compare the performance with that under the generalized Lloyd Algorithm for optimal codebook design. For codebook with power control, the generalized Lloyd Algorithm can be used for the optimal codebook design, but incurs high complexity. We propose a low-complexity suboptimal method, which can directly use the optimal power control solution for perfect channel knowledge under the individual power constraint. Through simulation study, it is found that it is more beneficial to use codebook with power control over codebook without power control when relays are closer to destination, instead of the source.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356901/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13149039","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356901/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On codebook design for distributed relay beamforming network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On codebook design for distributed relay beamforming network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p323zheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054988S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6356903,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Hsien Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Hsien","lastName":"Tsai","id":"38523690600"},{"name":"Tzu-Hsien Sang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Hsien","lastName":"Sang","id":"37296976200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356903","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Correlation","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Downlink","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","compensation","computational complexity","Long Term Evolution","radio links","signal detection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization","cell search procedure","carrier frequency offsets","3GPP-LTE downlink","3rd generation partnership project long term evolution standard","timing detection","secondary synchronization signal","SSS","fractional carrier frequency offset","FCFO","primary synchronization signal-based joint synchronization","integer carrier frequency offset compensation","ICFO compensation","physical-layer cell identity","cell-ID","combating carrier frequency offsets","computational complexity","signal arrangement"]}],"abstract":"A timing synchronization and cell search procedure for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP-LTE) standard is proposed.

Slow convergence rate is a drawback of subspace method in deriving the noise/signal subspaces from the second-order statistics of received signals, especially when the dimension of received signals is large. In this paper, the block matrix scheme is proposed to generate a group of sub-vectors from each OFDM symbols. The dimension of sub-vectors is reduced and the number of equivalent signals is increased, and therefore, the convergence rate of channel estimation is enhanced. The semi-blind method is also developed by incorporating the subspace technology with pilot information.

First, we consider a multi-user BC (broadcast) situation where a precoding is applied at every carrier. This is considered to be a very demanding situation for peak-to-average ratio reduction. Tellado's Tone Reservation, however, is especially suited for this situation, as well. It reserves all spatial dimensions of the reserved carriers and has hence not to take into account possible implications resulting from precoding. Secondly, for a point-to-point (pt2pt) MIMO-OFDM scenario, we assume that the last eigenchannel is too weak to be used for transmission, thus, reserving it will offer redundancy for peak-to-average ratio reduction. The algorithm in both cases completely operates in time domain and is shown to additionally profit from multiple spatial dimensions when iteratively only the highest peak spatial components are processed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-average ratio reduction with Tone Reservation in multi-user and MIMO OFDM","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356910","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356910.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-average ratio reduction with Tone Reservation in multi-user and MIMO OFDM","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356910/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149048","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-average ratio reduction with Tone Reservation in multi-user and MIMO OFDM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p372henkel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040885S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6356911,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38523235300"},{"name":"Pinyi Ren","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Pinyi","lastName":"Ren","id":"37282088300"},{"name":"Qinghe Du","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qinghe","lastName":"Du","id":"37267188400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356911","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Complexity theory","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Sorting","Algorithm design and analysis","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable breadth based adaptive tree search algorithm","MIMO systems","maximum-likelihood detections","multiple-input multiple-output systems","breadth-first scheme","upper-bound","breadth-first detection","high computational complexity","VBA scheme","variable metric constraint","partial zero-forcing sequence","ZF sequence","adaptive candidate selection process","bit-error-rate performance","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","complexity","variable breadth","adaptive tree search"]}],"abstract":"Near maximum-likelihood (ML) detections based on the tree search can approach the optimal performance with reduced complexity in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of V-OFDM with linear Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver. We first show that for linear MMSE receiver, all the vector blocks (VB) in V-OFDM have equal performance, this is different from V-OFDM with ML receiver, where different VBs may have different performances. Then, we analyze the diversity order of V-OFDM with linear MMSE receiver, and show that, regardless of the V-OFDM symbol length N, the diversity order can be represented as min{[M2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">_</sup>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sup>\n], D} + 1, where M is the VB size, R is the spectrum efficiency in bits/symbol, and D is the maximum delay of the multipath channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356912","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356912.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of vector OFDM with linear MMSE receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356912/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of vector OFDM with linear MMSE receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149050","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356912/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of vector OFDM with linear MMSE receiver","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p382li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068625S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356913,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Wang","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293612000"},{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wu","id":"38519622500"},{"name":"Chunli Gao","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, China"],"firstName":"Chunli","lastName":"Gao","id":"38516918800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356913","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","OFDM","Equations","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM modulations","OSTBC-OFDM systems","generalized exact closed-form SER analysis","symbol error rate","Nakagami-m fading channels","hypergeometric functions","probability density function","antenna configurations","Monte Carlo simulation","orthogonal space-time block coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance for OSTBC-OFDM systems over Nakagami-m fading channels is analyzed.

In particular, we consider a linear cellular network where BSs are regularly deployed and users are uniformly distributed. Given the traffic variation process and the performance constraint, we obtain the energy optimal BS density by evaluating the network energy consumption in an analytical way.

Channel availability statistics are assumed to evolve as i.i.d. Bernoulli random processes with means unknown to the secondary users. In addition, the number of secondary users M is unknown to each user. The main objective here is to design a distributed online learning and access policy which maximizes the total throughput of the secondary users. It has previously been shown that this problem can elegantly be modeled as a decentralized multi-armed bandit (DMAB) problem when M is known. We propose a truly decentralized online learning algorithm based on DMAB problem for unknown M. We show that using distributed access policies with wrong knowledge of M results in linear growth of regret, and underestimation incurs more significant loss than overestimation does. For distributed online learning of M, we propose a dynamic thresholding method, where the thresholds are dynamically determined using virtual systems built upon the current estimates of mean channel availabilities. Our algorithm allows both overestimation and underestimation in estimating M over time, and thus is capable of tracking the population change of secondary users.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356916","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356916.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356916","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","startPage":"405","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed opportunistic spectrum access with unknown population","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed opportunistic spectrum access with unknown population","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356916/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149054","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed opportunistic spectrum access with unknown population","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p405zandi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056531S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356918,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38521039200"},{"name":"Weiqiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Weiqiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239994400"},{"name":"Xiaohui Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37309345800"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280464200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356918","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference constraints","Femtocell networks","Wireless communication","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","femtocellular radio","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction-based resource allocation problem","spectrum-sharing femtocell networks","VCG auction mechanism","uplink transmission","optimum resource allocation scheme","macrocell network revenue"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the resource allocation problem for spectrum-sharing femtocell networks.

The effect of various parameters on the boundary of the R-E region is demonstrated for different frequency selective channel models.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356931","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356931.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","startPage":"481","endPage":"486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous transfer of energy and information for MIMO-OFDM relay system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous transfer of energy and information for MIMO-OFDM relay system","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356931/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149069","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356931/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous transfer of energy and information for MIMO-OFDM relay system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p481chalise.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062655S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6356932,"authors":[{"name":"Yixin Li","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Li","id":"38519586100"},{"name":"Wenjin Wang","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292856200"},{"name":"Fu-Chun Zheng","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Fu-Chun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38182100600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356932","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a combined bulk and per-tone transmission scheme for distributed cooperative decode-and-forward OFDM system.

The main idea of the proposed PESD is to reduce the detection complexity by decreasing the branching factor for the search tree. The trade-off between the performance and complexity can be easily controlled by the branching factor. In order to further improve the PESD, a hybrid PESD is proposed by combining the full enumeration for the first several layers of the search tree and the proposed PESD.

Simulation results show the proposed scheme yields great performance gains in terms of the spectrum efficiency relative to the legacy soft frequency reuse and universal frequency reuse.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for inbuilding dense femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356941","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356941.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for inbuilding dense femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356941/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149079","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme for inbuilding dense femtocell networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p530chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05094S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356942,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Department of Communication Science and Engineering Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086654019"},{"name":"Yu Zhu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Department of Communication Science and Engineering Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086651505"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356942","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Femtocell networks","Quality of service","Macrocell networks","Convergence","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","power control","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio networks","Stackelberg game","intelligent indoor wireless coverage","enhanced network capacity","network topology","intensified interference","SG-based power control scheme","noncooperative femtocells","network power controller","NPC","femtocellular power consumption","quality of service","QoS","femtocell terminals","sum interference constraint","Stackelberg equilibrium","SE","distributed algorithm","fast convergence property","noncooperative game scheme"]}],"abstract":"As an encouraging solution to provide intelligent indoor wireless coverage and enhanced network capacity, femtocell has drawn considerable attention from both academia and industry. However, the random deployments of these autonomous devices has complicated the current network topology and thus will lead to intensified interference to the in-use macrocell networks. In this paper, we propose a Stackelberg game (SG)-based power control scheme to impose regulation on these noncooperative femtocells. Specifically, a network power controller (NPC) is assumed as the leader of the SG and the femtocells it connects to play as the followers. By pricing for the femtocells power consumption, the NPC tries to minimize the transmit power of the femtocell network under both the quality of service (QoS) constrains at femtocell terminals and the sum interference constrain at the macrocell terminals. We prove that an unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) exists in this game and a distributed algorithm that converges to the SE is further proposed. Numerical results show that besides the fast convergence property, our algorithm greatly reduces the transmit power of femtocells and therefore, improves the power efficiency of the femtocell network as much as 10 times, compared with that of the pure non-cooperative game scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control of femtocell networks based on Stackelberg game","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356942","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356942.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Power control of femtocell networks based on Stackelberg game","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356942/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149080","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control of femtocell networks based on Stackelberg game","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p535li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103128S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356943,"authors":[{"name":"Joyce Wu","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Joyce","lastName":"Wu","id":"37421802300"},{"name":"Xiaoli Chu","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Chu","id":"37271636700"},{"name":"David L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College, London, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"Haibo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716004200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356943","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Macrocell networks","Interference","Propagation losses","Ultrafast electronics","Shadow mapping","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell exclusion regions","hierarchical 3-sector macrocells","cochannel deployments","macrocell base station","MBS","femtocell access point","FAP","femto downlink services","DL outage probability","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Downlink","femtocell","macrocell","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"In co-channel deployments of macro and femto cells, the much higher transmit power of a macrocell base station (MBS) than that of a femtocell access point (FAP) may create a femtocell exclusion region (FER) around an MBS, where reliable femto downlink (DL) services cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we analyze the DL outage probability (OP) of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based femtocells in terms of their locations with respect to nearby 3-sector MBSs, and derive the expression of FER radius as a function of the azimuth angle relative to the MBS, which can be directly used to divide the macrocell coverage area into inner and outer regions for hybrid frequency assignments. Simulation results show that the obtained closed-form expressions can be used to accurately predict the location-dependent femto DL OP and the non-circular FER in hierarchical 3-sector macrocells. Our results also show that the FER shrinks at edges between macro sectors, giving more space for co-channel deployment of femtocells to improve spatial reuse.","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356943","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","startPage":"541","endPage":"545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell exclusion regions in hierarchical 3-sector macrocells for co-channel deployments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell exclusion regions in hierarchical 3-sector macrocells for co-channel deployments","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356943/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149081","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6356943/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell exclusion regions in hierarchical 3-sector macrocells for co-channel deployments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p541wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05499S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6356946,"authors":[{"name":"Gu Lv","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Gu","lastName":"Lv","id":"38521636500"},{"name":"Mingchuan Yang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Mingchuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37065863400"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37293376700"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"38518529800"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Liu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38521733100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356946","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"abstract":"This paper discusses the construction of the Accumulate-Repeat-4-Jagged-Accumulate(AR4JA) codes which is suitable for the deep-space communication based on the protograph.

Two-step expansion improves the traditional PEG with adding the ACE algorithm for placing edges in a protograph-based code, which brings down the error floor. Compared to the traditional random expansion and the one step expansion like Progressive Edge-Growth(PEG), the two-step construction algorithm aims at constructing the AR4JA codes with high performance and low complexity. Verified by the simulation, the BER performance of the two-step expansion method is similar to the ideal AR4JA codes in the deep space channel condition. With the same Eb/N0, the two-step construction method shows the lower BER than random construction method and one-step extension method through the simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Bit error rate","Decoding","Channel coding","Complexity theory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","error statistics","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protograph-based AR4JA code","deep space communication","accumulate-repeat-4-jagged-accumulate","two-step expansion","PEG","ACE algorithm","random expansion","progressive edge-growth","two-step construction algorithm","BER performance","deep space channel condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep space communication","Protograph codes","AR4JA codes","two-step expansion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356946","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356946","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356946","startPage":"556","endPage":"561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-step construction method of protograph-based AR4JA codes in deep space communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-step construction method of protograph-based AR4JA codes in deep space communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356946/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356946/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149084","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-step construction method of protograph-based AR4JA codes in deep space communication","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p556lv.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043353S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6356947,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xiao","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37717058900"},{"name":"Laura Cottatellucci","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Cottatellucci","id":"38491386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356947","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356947","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Training","Channel estimation","Satellites","Logic gates","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","frequency allocation","satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contention resolution","satellite random access channels","multibeam satellite system","universal frequency reuse","spatial diversity","satellite multiple antennas","active satellite terminal detection","channel coefficient estimation","grid reduction algorithm","colliding ST","successive channel cancellation algorithm","CSS algorithm","satellite RACH system"]}],"abstract":"We consider the random access channel (RACH) of a multi-beam satellite system with universal frequency reuse.

The resource scheduler has to ensure that delay deadlines of the packets get achieved and the resources are also not under utilized.

The instantaneous decisions of scheduler depend on current as well as future channel and packet arrival considerations. In this paper we represent hard delay deadlines of packets in the form of various constraints. We then develop a constrained optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm.

However, there are some critical issues in file storage which should be resolved urgently, such as the blocking file storage. In order to solve the shortages of hot file storage and parallel computing support issues in fixed-blocking storage, we propose a smart-blocking file storage method in this paper. By setting up 6 grouping factors, the method can determine whether the file should be blocked or not automatically depending on the size of the file and the client bandwidth. The proposed method can block the file into similar size sub-blocks as large as possible when the file is judged to be blocked. Normally the size of the last sub-block is smaller than other similar sub-blocks. But the gap maintains within the size of the next smaller grouping factor. The Metadata server can address the hot files when the file is blocked. In addition, the proposed method also defines the file uniformity and the system uniformity to quantitatively describe the uniformity of sub-blocks in the file and in the whole system. Analysis and simulation demonstrate the proposed method has better system uniformity in file storage, the node load balance caused by hot file, and a large number of file fragments reduction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149089","htmlLink":"/document/6356951/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Smart-blocking file storage method in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart-blocking file storage method in cloud computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p57fan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048994S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356952,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37311410000"},{"name":"Danny H.K.

The objective of the CRN thus is to maximize the network-welfare of all PUs and SUs by forming optimal pairs among them, which can be considered as a Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem on a bipartite graph. We first propose an efficient algorithm to quantify the optimal social welfare associated with each pair of PU and SU.

It can be shown that this protocol is capable of increasing the throughput of UAC systems, when half-duplex mode is assumed.

We consider the case where channels are Rayleigh frequency selective, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is employed, and there is no line of sight (LOS) between source and destination clusters. Approximating the capacity of a single source-relay-destination link by a Gaussian random variable (RV), the global outage probability of this network is characterized allowing for correlated OFDM subcarrier gains and arbitrary number of bits on each subcarrier. The obtained global probability of outage is used as an objective function to formulate an optimization problem to allocate relays to source-destination pairs. The outage probability minimization problem through relay allocation then is converted to a standard assignment problem, for which a low complexity algorithm based on Hungarian method is proposed. The numerical results show the precision and effectiveness of our analysis and proposed relay allocation technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis and relay allocation for multi-stream OFDMA decode-and-forward Rayleigh fading networks","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356960","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356960.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis and relay allocation for multi-stream OFDMA decode-and-forward Rayleigh fading networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356960/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis and relay allocation for multi-stream OFDMA decode-and-forward Rayleigh fading networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p630boostanimehr.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074887S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6356961,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38516557100"},{"name":"Zhenyuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597204000"},{"name":"Qiushi Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qiushi","lastName":"Gong","id":"38522634100"},{"name":"Guo Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356961","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Robustness","Optimization","Minimization","Quality of service","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","multicast communication","radio networks","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust multicast beamforming","covariance channel state information","multicast wireless system","robust long-term transmit beamforming design","channel covariance","minimizing total transmission power","prescribed signal-to-noise ratio constraints","receivers","SNR","relative max-min fairness","transceiver","semidefinite programming","semidefinite relaxation techniques"]}],"abstract":"The problem of transmit beamforming design for multicast wireless system is considered in this paper.

It can effectively solve the interference problem encountered in cell edges. To conduct the processing, however, base stations need to exchange users' informations, yielding a communication overhead for the backhaul. This paper considers inter-site uplink CoMP processing for multi-input-multi-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first propose using the turbo equalization technique to improve the performance. In our scheme, the receiver consists of a soft MIMO equalizer and a soft channel decoder. The iteration is conducted between the equalizer and the decoder. With the inclusion of the exchanged informations in the iteration, the performance of the turbo equalization can be further improved. We then propose various exchanging strategies and find a good trade-off between performance gain and the required overhead. Compared with the optimum scheme, the proposed strategies can reduce the overhead significantly while the performance loss is small.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6333373/6356837/06356963.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6356963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo equalization for MIMO-OFDM systems with inter-site CoMP","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","MIMO","Decoding","OFDM","Quantization","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","MIMO communication","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM systems","coordinated multipoint processing","next generation mobile communications","interference problem","base stations","communication overhead","intersite uplink CoMP processing","multi-input-multi-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing systems","turbo equalization technique","soft MIMO equalizer","soft channel decoder","performance gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CoMP","Turbo Equalization","MIMO-OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Turbo equalization for MIMO-OFDM systems with inter-site CoMP","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356963/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13149101","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo equalization for MIMO-OFDM systems with inter-site CoMP","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p642wong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041212S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6356971,"authors":[{"name":"Fadhil Firyaguna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bras\u00edlia-UnB, Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fadhil","lastName":"Firyaguna","id":"38516923500"},{"name":"Ana C.

The main idea is to navigate the routing path to avoid large interference to the primary users. We introduce a novel concept of guide strip as the navigation direction for routing. This guide strip is determined based on the visibility graph, which ensures a short packet travel distance, while the width of the guide strip is selected to guarantee a predefined successful routing probability.

However, SUs need to avoid the interference to PUs, imposing new challenges in routing protocol designs and throughput improvement in CR networks (CRN). In this paper we propose a cross-layer channel assignment and routing (CCAR) algorithm. Specifically, our CCAR algorithm aims at throughput maximization while addressing the interference avoidance issue in CRNs. Solving for the optimal solution towards throughput maximization is a NP problem. In contrast, we simplify this optimization problem by taking advantage of the correlation of data flow and routing information across the network nodes. Then, further making use of the adjacent hop interference (AHI) Information, we develop a heuristic approach to obtain a suboptimal solution. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed CCAR algorithm can achieve polynomial complexity at the cost of only 20% throughput loss as compared to the optimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6356982/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13149120","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6356982/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-optimized cross-layer routing for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-optimized cross-layer routing for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"p745zhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071376S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6333373","isNumber":"6356837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6333373","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6356837","articleId":"6356982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6356991,"authors":[{"name":"Na Lu","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Center, China Telecom Corporation Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Lu","id":"37546868300"},{"name":"Xuetian Zhu","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Center, China Telecom Corporation Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuetian","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37291664100"},{"name":"Fengyi Yang","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Center, China Telecom Corporation Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fengyi","lastName":"Yang","id":"38239897400"},{"name":"Qi Bi","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Center, China Telecom Corporation Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Bi","id":"37271278000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2815-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2814-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-8644"}],"articleNumber":"6356991","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Multiplexing","Transmitting antennas","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","indoor radio","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiplexing","precoding","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink MIMO performance evaluation","LTE/LTE-A indoor distributed antenna systems","indoor coverage","cellular systems","2G mobile network","3G mobile network","indoor DAS solution","multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO transmission modes","closed-loop spatial multiplexing","multiuser MIMO","MU-MIMO","imbalance effects","indoor scenario","antenna configurations","distributed antennas","MIMO modes","precoding codebook selection"]}],"abstract":"Distributed antenna systems (DAS) are used to improve indoor coverage in cellular systems, which has been widely deployed in the current 2G and 3G mobile networks.

In addition, the performance of different MIMO transmission modes will be discussed, including closed-loop spatial multiplexing and multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO). Simulation results show that the imbalance effects in indoor scenario have significant impact on downlink MIMO performance. The antenna configurations should be carefully considered before they are deployed.

QoS-DMO extends the time-frequency domain packet scheduling algorithm to the spatial domain, which takes into account multiple QoS factors (e.g., data rate, delay, BER, etc.) for real time service and nonreal time service and attaches importance to the BER influencing on selecting SDM technologies.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance that engineers ensure as low values for grounding resistance as possible, during the designing phase as well as the lifecycle of the grounding system. A widely used technique of reducing the grounding resistance value, in case of high soil resistivity values, or lack of adequate space for the installation of grounding systems, is the use of ground enhancing compounds. This paper presents a methodology, for the evaluation of grounding resistance, under various meteorological conditions, of grounding systems embedded in natural soil as well as in ground enhancing compounds, using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN training is based on field measurements that have been performed in Greece during the last year. As a matter of fact, this is a first step to develop a new method for estimating variations of grounding resistance value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357068/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13149204","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6357068/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Estimation of ground enhancing compound performance using Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of ground enhancing compound performance using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"B32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067467S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340540","isNumber":"6356989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340540","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6356989","articleId":"6357068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6357163,"authors":[{"name":"Sasitharan Balasubramaniam","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Finland","Waterford Institute of Technology, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Sasitharan Balasubramaniam is a research fellow at Tampere University of Technology, Finland, and Waterford Institute of Technology, Ireland.

In public cloud environment, the client moves its data to public cloud server (PCS) and cannot control its remote data. Thus, information security is an important problem in public cloud storage, such as data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In some cases, the client has no ability to check its remote data possession, such as the client is in prison because of committing crime, on the ocean-going vessel, in the battlefield because of the war, and so on. It has to delegate the remote data possession checking task to some proxy. In this paper, we study proxy provable data possession (PPDP). In public clouds, PPDP is a matter of crucial importance when the client cannot perform the remote data possession checking. We study the PPDP system model, the security model, and the design method. Based on the bilinear pairing technique, we design an efficient PPDP protocol. Through security analysis and performance analysis, our protocol is provable secure and efficient.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proxy Provable Data Possession in Public Clouds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2012.35","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6679380/06357181.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2012.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6679380","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Proxy Provable Data Possession in Public Clouds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13952247","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proxy Provable Data Possession in Public Clouds","sourcePdf":"tsc2013040551.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042664S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6679380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"111","articleId":"6357181","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6357194,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Kviatkovsky","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6516859/6357194/6357194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Igor Kviatkovsky received the BSc degree in computer science in 2006 and the MSc degree in 2012 from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.

In some applications-such as specific person identification-it is highly likely that the color distributions will be multimodal and hence contain a special structure. Although the color distribution changes under different lighting conditions, some aspects of its structure turn out to be invariants. We refer to this structure as an intradistribution structure, and show that it is invariant under a wide range of imaging conditions while being discriminative enough to be practical. Our signature uses shape context descriptors to represent the intradistribution structure. Assuming the widely used diagonal model, we validate that our signature is invariant under certain illumination changes. Experimentally, we use color information as the only cue to obtain good recognition performance on publicly available databases covering both indoor and outdoor conditions. Combining our approach with the complementary covariance descriptor, we demonstrate results exceeding the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging VIPeR and CAVIAR4REID databases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6516859/06357194.pdf","startPage":"1622","endPage":"1634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Invariants for Person Reidentification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Lighting","Shape","Color","Context","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","lighting","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color invariants","person reidentification","specific object recognition","specific person identification","color distribution changes","lighting conditions","intradistribution structure","imaging conditions","shape context descriptors","diagonal model","illumination changes","color information","publicly available databases","complementary covariance descriptor","VIPeR","CAVIAR4REID databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surveillance applications","person reidentification","color invariant signatures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Color Invariants for Person Reidentification","volume":"35","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6357194/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13502195","pubMedId":"23681991","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Invariants for Person Reidentification","sourcePdf":"ttp2013071622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184717S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6516859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"6516859","articleId":"6357194","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6357197,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chieh Chi","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Yu-Chieh Chi was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1983.

The direct modulation of such an TO-can/jacket-SMA packaged FPLD with a 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and single subcarrier optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OOFDM) format data stream at carrier frequency up to 6 GHz is approached with 10 MSa/s symbol rate. The optimized 256-QAM data with error vector magnitude (EVM) of 1.5% and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 32.5 dB are observed, corresponding to a bit error rate as low as 1.1 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n and a highest carrier-to-noise ratio of 43.5 dB. Under injection locking, the tradeoff between the lengthened photon lifetime and the enlarged threshold current reduction of such an M-QAM-N-OOFDM modulated FPLD is theoretically and experimentally investigated to explain the saturation of SNR at 31.5 dB and EVM at 1.7%.

The corresponding EVM and SNR for the 16-QAM OOFDM are determined as 11.67% and 20 dB, respectively. Under 64-QAM and 200-subcarrier OOFDM modulation, the received data stream shows a slightly degraded EVM and SNR of 12.85% and 19 dB, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6387606/06357197.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2229461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2229461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specific Jacket SMA-Connected TO-Can Package FPLD Transmitter With Direct Modulation Bandwidth Beyond 6 GHz for 256-QAM Single or Multisubcarrier OOFDM up to 15 Gb/s","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Frequency modulation","Diode lasers","Optical transmitters","Connectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct modulation bandwidth","multisubcarrier OOFDM","SMA connector","jacket signal pin configuration","transistor outline can packaged Fabry-P\u00e9rot laser diode transmitter","quadrature amplitude modulation","single subcarrier optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","injection locking","lengthened photon lifetime","M-QAM-N-OOFDM","FPLD","256-QAM","16-QAM","64-QAM","bit rate 15.6 Gbit/s","bit rate 23.4 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)","error vector magnitude (EVM)","optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OOFDM)","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","SMA","transistor outline can (TO-can) packaged Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot laser diode (FPLD)","256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)","200-subcarrier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Specific Jacket SMA-Connected TO-Can Package FPLD Transmitter With Direct Modulation Bandwidth Beyond 6 GHz for 256-QAM Single or Multisubcarrier OOFDM up to 15 Gb/s","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6357197/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13188012","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specific Jacket SMA-Connected TO-Can Package FPLD Transmitter With Direct Modulation Bandwidth Beyond 6 GHz for 256-QAM Single or Multisubcarrier OOFDM up to 15 Gb/s","sourcePdf":"jlt-lin-2229461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095874S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6387606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6387606","articleId":"6357197","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6357201,"authors":[{"name":"Lijia Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lijia Zhang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electric and Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","Currently, she is a Lecturer with the School of Electric Engineering and member of the State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications in BUPT.

As the dramatic increase of network capacity and secret sensitivity, the issue of physical layer security becomes more and more important. This paper proposes a novel physical-enhanced chaotic secure strategy for optical OFDM system based on two-dimensional (2-D) permutation. A controlled Logistic map is adopted for the chaotic mapping. The 2-D secure algorithm jointly utilizes frequency subcarriers and time-slots permutation to guarantee the secure of physical layer security of optical OFDM transmission system. This method performs dynamic permutations over frequency and time dimensions, resulting in a robust protection on transmitted information.

This paper investigates different transmitter configurations along with a general pointing, acquisition and tracking (PAT) algorithm on key parameters including power availability at the receiver, switching time, link recapturing time, and coverage area at the receiver plane. The alignment control algorithm with different ways to track receiver is also evaluated on these key parameters. The algorithm performance versus transmitted power, switching time and the threshold power for beam steering was examined. The investigation finds that a combination of switching combined with splitting of the light between fibers is a suitable solution to provide the best trade-off between link up time and the coverage area at the receiver, and thus is a good general purpose design choice, and the optical tracking system with target location information demands fewer efforts to recover and maintain the dynamic link than the one without the awareness of the receiver location information.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2228467","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6387664/06357202.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2228467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Fiber-Bundle Based Transmitter Configurations With Alignment Control <newline/>Algorithm for Mobile FSO Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357202/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Fiber-Bundle Based Transmitter Configurations With Alignment Control <newline/>Algorithm for Mobile FSO Nodes","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13188023","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6357202/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Fiber-Bundle Based Transmitter Configurations With Alignment Control <newline/>Algorithm for Mobile FSO Nodes","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhou-2228467-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05315S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6387664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6387664","articleId":"6357202","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6357203,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Hou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Hou","id":"38526411200"},{"name":"Xiangfei Chen","affiliation":["Microwave-Photonics Technology Laboratory, Nanjing National Laboratory of Microstructures and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278212100"},{"name":"Lixian Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lixian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900108600"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279188800"},{"name":"Ninghua Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ninghua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37285811100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"6357203","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1249},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"The relation between the output wavelengths of a laser array and the injection currents of all the channels is experimentally investigated and is found to be approximately linear.

NeuroBot's humanlike behavior was tested by competing in the 2011 BotPrize competition, in which human judges play UT2004 and rate the humanness of other avatars that are controlled by a human or a bot. NeuroBot came a close second, achieving a humanness rating of 36%, while the most human human reached 67%.

The phase shift of the microwave signal at the output of the TTD cell compared to its input is a measure of the permittivity of MUTs. For wideband and accurate sensing, TTD cells are cascaded in a reconfigurable fashion to increase the detected phase shift, especially at low frequencies. TTD cells are designed to detect permittivities within the range of 1-30 considering nonideal effects, such as electromagnetic coupling between adjacent TTD cells. Calibration using reference liquids is applied to the fabricated sensor and sensor characteristics are extracted. Permittivity detection of organic chemicals is performed in the range of 1-8 GHz with an error less than 2%. The measured permittivities in the 1-8-GHz range are used to estimate the sub-1-GHz permittivities of MUTs using extrapolation.

Widely used commercially available ICP measuring devices require the use of a tethered fiber optic probe, which can cause complications, such as infection and hemorrhage. The use of a probe also prohibits immediate (at the time of induced injury) and long-term measurements of ICP. Therefore, we have developed and tested a small fully embedded wireless ICP sensor, incorporating a novel antenna and packaging arrangement. Evaluations were performed in-vitro and in-vivo to demonstrate the robustness of this microwave pressure-monitoring system. This is the first report of in-vivo tests in a dynamic study of continuous (every 6 s) wireless ICP measurements in a swine model of closed-head rotational-acceleration induced TBI using a digital device. In particular, our device measured extreme changes in ICP immediately upon rapid head rotation that persisted for hours after the injury. The readings matched well those obtained from a commercially available tethered monitor. Our device can be utilized in the future as a tool to diagnose and track long-term ICP changes.","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6414699/06357262.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2224361","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2224361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357262","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative closest point algorithm","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Monitoring","Injuries","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","biomedical electronics","biomedical equipment","blood","brain","fibre optic sensors","injuries","intelligent sensors","patient monitoring","pressure sensors","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic evaluation","digital wireless intracranial pressure sensor","traumatic brain injury","swine model","wireless ICP measurements","increased intracranial pressure control","patient treatment","fiber optic probe","hemorrhage","infection","antenna","packaging arrangement","microwave pressure-monitoring system","closed-head rotational-acceleration","TBI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital wireless implants","intracranial pressure (ICP)","rotational head injury","slot antenna","traumatic brain injury (TBI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Evaluation of a Digital Wireless Intracranial Pressure Sensor for the Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Swine Model","accessionNumber":"13244769","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6357262/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Evaluation of a Digital Wireless Intracranial Pressure Sensor for the Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Swine Model","sourcePdf":"tmtt-meng-2224361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086192S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6414699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6414699","articleId":"6357262","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6357295,"authors":[{"name":"S.

finite-element analysis (FEA). The designed slotted TORUS motor produces sinusoidal back-EMF waveform, maximum power density, and reduced cogging torque. The GA obtained the dimensions of motors with different numbers of slots and the highest possible power density. Electromagnetic field analysis of the candidate motors obtained from GA with various dimensions is subjected through FEA to obtain the motors' characteristics. Based on the GA and FEA results, a candidate motor design is introduced and subjected to FEA for reoptimization and finalization of the motor design. Techniques like modifying winding configuration and permanent magnet skewing are investigated to attain the most sinusoidal back-EMF waveform and reduced cogging torque. FEA and GA simulation results are compared and agreed well to the flux density in various areas of the designed motor at no-load condition. The final designed motor (1 kW, 50 Hz, four poles) is fabricated and tested. Experimental results agree with those of the simulation, both satisfying the desired technical specifications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","volume":"49","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13401220","htmlLink":"/document/6357308/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design, Analysis, and Prototyping of an Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Motor Based on Genetic Algorithm and Finite-Element Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Analysis, and Prototyping of an Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Motor Based on Genetic Algorithm and Finite-Element Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmag-mahmoudi-2228213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091627S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6482656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"6482656","articleId":"6357308","onlineDate":"20 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6357321,"authors":[{"name":"Bader N.

The system utilizes transformer-less single-stage conversion for tracking the maximum power point and interfacing the photovoltaic arrays to the grid. The maximum power point is maintained with a fuzzy logic controller. A proportional-resonant controller is used to control the current injected into the grid. To improve the power quality and system efficiency, a double-tuned parallel resonant circuit is proposed to attenuate the second- and fourth- order harmonics at the inverter dc side. A modified carrier-based modulation technique for the current source inverter is proposed to magnetize the dc-link inductor by shorting one of the bridge converter legs after every active switching cycle.

Simulation results show that the extensive mapping ability of neural network and the rapid global convergence of artificial bee colony algorithm can be obtained by combining artificial bee colony algorithm and neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2012.6357623","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353005/6357478/06357623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2012.6357623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back propagation neural network based on artificial bee colony algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Back propagation neural network based on artificial bee colony algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13251676","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6357623/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back propagation neural network based on artificial bee colony algorithm","confLoc":"Tomsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"0319ICT219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049472S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353005","isNumber":"6357478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353005","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6357478","articleId":"6357623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6357749,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Seok Park","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong Seok","lastName":"Park","id":"37290675500"},{"name":"Ta Ngoc Thien Binh","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ta Ngoc Thien","lastName":"Binh","id":"38517396700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1773-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1772-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1771-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6357749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Radio frequency","Genetic algorithms","Aluminum","Neural networks","Reliability","Strain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forming processes","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","product quality","production engineering computing","reliability","rolling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-based neural network model","roll forming process","product quality","RF process parameter","training reliability","optimal algorithm","genetic algorithm","hill climbing algorithm","KBNN model","local optimal region","HCB","best location area detection","training error","finite element analysis","high fidelity FE model","trained data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Roll Forming process","Knowledge-Based Neural Network","Hill Climbing","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357749","abstract":"Knowledge-Based Neural Network (KBNN) model is one of the most useful methods which is used to predict every single variability to perform the parameters on data of the Roll forming (RF) process. It is true that the quality of product and the parameters in RF process depend on the reliability of the training in KBNN. To achieve this, the new novel of the optimal algorithm including integration between Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill climbing Algorithm (HCB) was proposed to train the KBNN model. Initially, the GA is applied to find the local optimal region, then, the HCB will detect the best location area in which the training error of the KBNN model is less than 8%. In addition, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results of the high fidelity FE model were used to obtain the trained data set of the KBNN model. From simulation results, it can be concluded that the efficiency of the proposed method is higher than that of the conventional methods in optimization of the RF process.","doi":"10.1109/IFOST.2012.6357749","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFOST.2012.6357749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357478","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6353005/6357478/06357749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Roll forming process using the integration between Genetic Algorithm and Hill climbing with neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357749/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Roll forming process using the integration between Genetic Algorithm and Hill climbing with neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6357749/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13251466","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Roll forming process using the integration between Genetic Algorithm and Hill climbing with neural network","confLoc":"Tomsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"0548MENDT602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042933S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6353005","isNumber":"6357478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6353005","xplore-issue":"6357478","articleId":"6357749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6357819,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Yu.

of cooperative multiple uninhabited combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). To address challenges posed by the specific MAP problem, we propose a new immune particle swarm optimization (NIPSO) approach through incorporating immunity memory, diversity clone, and immune selection in artificial immune algorithm into standard PSO. The simulation results achieved on a typical scenario show that our NIPSO approach for multiple UCAVs is capable of substantially speeding up convergence and has stronger ability to find the global optimum than that of classical PSO. The MAP solution for cooperative UCAVs is significantly improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6357940/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13166775","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6357940/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new approach to solve the mission assignment problem for cooperative UCAVs using immune particle swarm optimizations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to solve the mission assignment problem for cooperative UCAVs using immune particle swarm optimizations","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059076S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6357940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6357947,"authors":[{"name":"Haritha Srinivasan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Haritha","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"38520202800"},{"name":"Sauvik Gupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Sauvik","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38518426800"},{"name":"Weihua Sheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37276312200"},{"name":"Heping Chen","affiliation":["Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, San Marcos, San Marcos, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Heping Chen","id":"37087264110"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6357947","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Force","Haptic interfaces","Muscles","Artificial neural networks","Data acquisition","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","estimation theory","haptic interfaces","medical signal processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand force estimation","surface electromyography signals","artificial neural network","haptic technology","rehabilitation robotics","telepresence surgery","gaming","virtual reality","human-robot interaction","haptic applications","SEMG signals","ANN","haptic device","virtual spring","EMG data","wrist flexion action","neural network performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Haptic technology","Surface EMG","Artificial Neural Network","virtual reality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6357947","abstract":"Haptic technology has many real world applications such as rehabilitation robotics, telepresence surgery, gaming, virtual reality and human-robot interaction.

The biology is characteristic of biologic phototaxis and negative phototaxis. Can a machine be endowed with such a characteristic? This is the question we study in this paper. A randomly generated network is used as the main computational unit. Only the weights of the output units from this network are adjusted during the training phase.

In the uplink communication, the interference generated by a macrocell user at the edge of the macrocell base station (MBS) coverage area may cause the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received at the nearby femtocell base station (FBS) below the requirement, and the region in which the nearby FBS can not meet its SINR requirement is called a Femtocell Dead Zone (FDZ). In order to guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) of macrocell users and femtocell users, the transmission power of femtocell users should be controlled properly. In this work, the uplink interference scenario that exists between a femtocell and a macrocell is modeled and discussed in detail, and then, the fundamental limit of the achievable SINR at MBS and FBS is shown. Numerical results present a straightforward way to establish the FDZ and show the impact of the uplink interference from macrocell user on the QoS of the nearby femtocell user.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Dead Zone analysis for co-channel two-tier femtocell network","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358023","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358023.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Dead Zone analysis for co-channel two-tier femtocell network","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358023/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13166858","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Dead Zone analysis for co-channel two-tier femtocell network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06359S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6358029,"authors":[{"name":"Xingzheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xingzheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38522991900"},{"name":"Jianting Yue","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianting","lastName":"Yue","id":"38521986600"},{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","id":"38182827100"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education of China, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan","id":"37275635400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6358029","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Resource management","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Mathematical model","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","Lyapunov methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation","queueing theory","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow rate control","resource allocation policy","security demands","OFDMA networks","data transmissions","secure transmission","base station","dynamic queueing","Lyapunov optimization","computational complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Flow Control","Dynamic Queueing","Lyapunov Optimization"]}],"abstract":"OFDMA-based network performs well in maximizing the overall throughput, and meanwhile, problems with security requirements are focused to satisfy the increasing needs of confidential data transmissions. According to information theory, however, secure transmission undesirably antagonizes larger flow rate, thus a tradeoff is expected to balance these two matters. In this paper, we consider a downlink situation in OFDMA network, where all users request secure transmission from the base station yet the resources including power and subcarriers are limited such that an appropriate policy on resource allocation can play an instrumental role. Dynamic queueing and Lyapunov optimization are two highlights in this process. We utilize dynamic queueing so that merely instantaneous state of the network is enough, which is advantageous for easier implementations. On the other hand, by the means of Lyapunov optimization, we also prove our algorithm can obtain a performance of flow rate admission extremely close to the optimal. Applying this policy can reduce computational complexity significantly but still perform close to optimality.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358029","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow rate control and resource allocation policy with security demands in OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flow rate control and resource allocation policy with security demands in OFDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358029/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13166864","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6358029/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow rate control and resource allocation policy with security demands in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066089S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6358064,"authors":[{"name":"Dequan Li","affiliation":["College of Science, Anhui University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Dequan","lastName":"Li","id":"37277110900"},{"name":"Qipeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Qipeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38520797500"},{"name":"Xiaofan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281387900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6358064","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Quantization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Convergence","Symmetric matrices","Network topology","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","convergence","directed graphs","Lyapunov methods","matrix algebra","multi-agent systems","network theory (graphs)","protocols","quantisation (signal)","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication bandwidth","network topology","multiagent system","distributed consensus protocol","quantization scheme","balanced digraph","average consensus protocol","logarithmic quantization scheme","quantized consensus problem","directed network","upper bound","quantization precision parameter","matrix transformation","Lyapunov stability theory","quantized protocol","convergence analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["consensus","quantization","digraph"]}],"abstract":"Communication bandwidth and network topology are two important factors that affect performance of distributed consensus for multi-agent systems. To deal with the limited bandwidth problem, quantization schemes have been presented. The available works about quantized average consensus require the agents to communicate in balanced digraphs, which is difficult to realize in the real world. By dropping this stringent requirement, we revisit an existing average consensus protocol based on logarithmic quantization scheme and investigate the quantized consensus problem on general strongly connected directed networks. An upper bound of the quantization precision parameter is derived to design the suitable logarithmic quantizer. Based on matrix transformation and Lyapunov stability theory, we provide a testable condition under which the weighted average consensus can be achieved with the proposed quantized protocol.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358064","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358064","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis for quantized consensus of multi-agent systems with directed topologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Convergence analysis for quantized consensus of multi-agent systems with directed topologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358064/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13166899","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence analysis for quantized consensus of multi-agent systems with directed topologies","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072624S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6358070,"authors":[{"name":"Yinlong Hu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yinlong","lastName":"Hu","id":"38466292000"},{"name":"Michael Z.

strict-feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties. In the controller design process, all unknown terms at intermediate steps are passed down and approximated by a single neural network at the last step. By this way, the structure of the designed controller is much simpler, and the control law and the adaptive law can be given directly. The result of stability analysis shows that the proposed scheme can guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system signals, and the control performance can be guaranteed by an appropriate choice of the control parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358086","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1333","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358086.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive neural network control for strict-feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358086/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive neural network control for strict-feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358086/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13150850","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive neural network control for strict-feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082904S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6358092,"authors":[{"name":"Janson Naiborhu","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Jawa Barat, ID"],"firstName":"Janson","lastName":"Naiborhu","id":"37276401000"},{"name":"Firman","affiliation":["Industrial & Financial Mathematics Group, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, ITB., Gedung Labtek III, Lantai 3, Jln.

The high gain adaptive observer for joint state and unknown parameter estimation is conceptually simple. The new algorithm makes use of a time varying gain matrix for unknown parameter estimation, which simplifies the initialization and parameter tuning. In order to establish the global exponential convergence of the adaptive observer, a persistent excitation condition is required. Consequently, the global exponential convergence for simultaneous estimation of states and unknown parameters is formally established following a simple procedure. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the performance of this adaptive observer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive observer design for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358240","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358240.pdf","startPage":"2198","endPage":"2203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive observer design for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358240/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13151004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive observer design for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077994S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6358283,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Yao","affiliation":["Control Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yao","id":"37289622500"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Control Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37065978700"},{"name":"Hugh H.

To ensure the implementation of model predictive control, using its global optimization performance and constraint handling mechanism, a new particle-swarm optimization algorithm with the function of constraint handling, was proposed in this article. Taking into account the form of constraints and the constraints characteristics of MIMO (multi-input multi-output) predictive control system, this thesis, based on convex polyhedron geometry, discuss the feasibility of constrained model predictive control. Combined with duality theorem, the output constraints of system are transformed into constraints of input. After that, the constraints form which meets the requirements of control algorithm is obtained. Finally, particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to conduct the optimization of predictive control system. The simulation results of MIMO model with constraints showed the advantages and effectiveness of this algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent

A unique dynamic DDC strategy, based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) framework, is designed and implemented in programmable logic control (PLC) code for temperature regulation in the volumetric flow of a polymer single-screw extruder. With the DDC method, it is shown that a largely unknown square multivariable system is readily decoupled by actively estimating and rejecting the effects of both the internal plant dynamics and external disturbances. The proposed DDC approach requires very little information on plant model and has the inherent disturbance rejection ability, and it proves to be a great fit for the highly nonlinear and multivariable extrusion processes. Recently, the DDC design strategy has been put under rigorous test at Parker Hannifin Parflex hose extrusion plant. Across multiple production lines for over eight months, the product performance capability index (Cpk) was improved by 30 percent and energy consumption is reduced over 50 percent. The production line data demonstrates that ADRC is a transformative control technology with great potentials in streamline factory operations, saving energy and improving quality, all at the same time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy saving, factory-validated disturbance decoupling control design for extrusion processes","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358364","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358364.pdf","startPage":"2891","endPage":"2896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"An energy saving, factory-validated disturbance decoupling control design for extrusion processes","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358364/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13151128","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy saving, factory-validated disturbance decoupling control design for extrusion processes","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072304S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6358385,"authors":[{"name":"Fucai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Yanshan, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Fucai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275917600"},{"name":"Shu'en Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Yanshan, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Shu'en","lastName":"Wang","id":"38519051200"},{"name":"Jinmei Dou","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Yanshan, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Jinmei","lastName":"Dou","id":"38517358800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6358385","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Simulation","Data models","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy sets","Training data","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","gradient methods","heuristic programming","identification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy identification method","sigmoid data transfer function","data patterns","fuzzy model","data transformation technique","heuristic method","modeling procedures","fuzzy if then rules","nonfuzzy singletons","fine tuning","gradient descent learning algorithm","approximation accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy systems identification","data transformation","heuristic method","gradient descent"]}],"abstract":"Unlike the traditional approaches that utilize original data patterns to construct the fuzzy model, an approach exploiting both data transformation techniques and heuristic method is proposed to simplify the modeling procedures.

Unlike traditional SDC systems, the driven information is the output probability density function (OPDF), which is a kind of image mapping information to the true output values. A mixed 2-step adaptive neural network (NN) framework is studied, where the static NN is to describe the OPDF while the dynamic NN is to identify nonlinearity, uncertainty of system and to refine the OPDF model based on data of the input and statistic information of the output. To identify the sensor fault, an augmented descriptor system is employed, where the augmented state includes the plant state and the sensor fault. As a result, an adaptive strategy is given for nonlinear parameter estimation and sensor fault identification simultaneously. A sensor compensation rule is given to restore the plant by adding it to output feedback controller. The simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358444","startPage":"3311","endPage":"3315","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06358444.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6358444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven based adaptive fault diagnosis scheme for nonlinear stochastic distribution systems via 2-step neural networks and descriptor model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Stochastic processes","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Circuit faults","Stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","compensation","control nonlinearities","distributed control","fault diagnosis","feedback","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","probability","sensors","stochastic systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven based adaptive sensor fault diagnosis scheme","nonlinear stochastic distribution system","FD","compensation scheme","stochastic distribution control","SDC system","augmented descriptor model","output probability density function","image mapping information","mixed 2-step adaptive neural network","static NN","dynamic NN","nonlinearity","system uncertainty","OPDF model","augmented descriptor system","plant state","nonlinear parameter estimation","sensor fault identification","sensor compensation rule","output feedback controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven based adaptive fault diagnosis scheme for nonlinear stochastic distribution systems via 2-step neural networks and descriptor model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6358444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13151208","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven based adaptive fault diagnosis scheme for nonlinear stochastic distribution systems via 2-step neural networks and descriptor model","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079224S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6358444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6358474,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The maximum coefficients of DWT of phase A, B, C and zero sequence for post-fault current waveforms are used as an input for the training pattern. Various cases studies based on Thailand electricity distribution underground systems have been investigated so that the algorithm can be implemented.

However studies show that if the model is a mismatch, the robustness of predictive control is limited and we still need a more accurate prediction model. Prediction error compensation based on the principle of feedback correction is an effective method to improve the accuracy of the prediction in order to enhance the robustness of a control system. In this paper, a kind of dynamic BP network with online adjusted weight value is used to fit the predicted model error. Together with the predictive model, this constitutes a dynamic prediction combination. Eventually, a predictive control algorithm with dynamic compensation capacity is acquired. The algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy, increasing the robustness of the predictive control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358963","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338447/6358959/06358963.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6358959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic matrix control based on neural networks error compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic matrix control based on neural networks error compensation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13168984","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6358963/","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic matrix control based on neural networks error compensation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"02044487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07314S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338447","isNumber":"6358959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338447","xplore-issue":"6358959","articleId":"6358963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6358964,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu-Zhang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Xiu-Zhang Jin","id":"37553791700"},{"name":"Lin Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Lin Li","id":"38515754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1484-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1486-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6358964","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Powders","Fly ash","DH-HEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","boilers","feedforward neural nets","fly ash","power engineering computing","recurrent neural nets","sensors","steam power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unburned carbon","fly ash","utility boilers","coal-fIred boiler","feed-forward neural network soft sensor modeling","recurrent Elman neural network","boiler combustion process","power plant boiler","BP network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elman dynamic neural network","Unburned carbon in fly ash","Soft sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6358964","abstract":"Unburned carbon in fly ash is an important parameter affecting combustion efficiency of coal-fired boiler.

So it is difficult to establish an online control model. In order to overcome the impact of these factors on modeling the complex industrial system, this paper proposes a RBF neural network control method based on data and the optimization strategy through iterative learning control. According to the actual history data, the system output of the next iteration with RBF neural network is optimized, so that the error between the model and the measured value reduces in the iterative process gradually. The output track is close to the ideal track. Simulation results about the synthetic ammonia decarbonization process have shown that this method has better performance than fuzzy neural network and more effective to control the complex industry system. The control precision and the response speed of the system are improved obviously. It can provide an effective technical approach to solve a class of complex systems modeling and optimization control problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6358966/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13168987","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6358966/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The application of RBF neural network in the complex industry process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of RBF neural network in the complex industry process","confLoc":"Xian","sourcePdf":"02074514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073296S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338447","isNumber":"6358959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338447","xplore-issue":"6358959","articleId":"6358966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6359027,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Hua Li","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Jun-Hua Li","id":"37087913256"},{"name":"Hai-Jun Li","affiliation":["China University of Geosciences Beijing, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Hai-Jun Li","id":"37087346769"},{"name":"Qiang He","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Qiang He","id":"37087192538"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1484-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1486-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6359027","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359027","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Abstracts","Erbium","World Wide Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-expect noise","chance space","statistical learning theory","small-sample learning problem","nonprobability spaces","noise-free case"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chance space","Hybrid variable","Hybrid empirical risk minimization principle","Key theorem"]}],"abstract":"Statistical learning theory has been regarded as one of the best theories for solving the small-sample learning problem on probability space.

The existing methods don't simultaneously consider the temporal constraints from users, uncertain QoS information of candidate services and dynamic re-planning on run-time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to dynamically configure the services for service based process under both uncertain QoS information and temporal constraints. Our approach can efficiently select the appropriate services for multiple service based process in practical business environment. Furthermore, if some temporal constraint is violated in execution, we provide solutions to re-plan them so that the violations can be addressed on run-time. The usability of our approach is validated on a practical example.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359055","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06359055.pdf","startPage":"3509","endPage":"3514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic configuration of service based processes in cloud computing using linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359055/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic configuration of service based processes in cloud computing using linear programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13151246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6359055/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic configuration of service based processes in cloud computing using linear programming","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06827S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6359055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6359065,"authors":[{"name":"Pengxiao Jia","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengxiao","lastName":"Jia","id":"38516278900"},{"name":"En Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"En","lastName":"Li","id":"37536085200"},{"name":"Zizhe Liang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zizhe Liang","id":"38522890100"},{"name":"Yanhui Qiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yanhui Qiang","id":"38235503000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6359065","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Trajectory","Adaptive systems","Adaptation models","Robots","Mathematical model","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","beams (structures)","dexterous manipulators","machinery","manipulator dynamics","manipulator kinematics","neurocontrollers","off-road vehicles","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network control","aerial work platform arm","off-highway vehicle","beams","inaccessible areas","manipulation complexity reduction","safety enhancement","productivity enhancement","operation process","two-link model","AWP arm steering","asymptotic trajectory tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial work platform","Adaptive neural network","Trajectory tracking","Task space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359065","abstract":"An aerial work platform (AWP) is a type of off highway vehicle with a long beam to provide temporary access to inaccessible areas [1].

AUV path planning in 3-D complex environments without currents, with constant currents, and with variable currents are studied through simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359093","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06359093.pdf","startPage":"3724","endPage":"3730","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network based AUV path planning in estuary environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network based AUV path planning in estuary environments","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13151284","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359093/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network based AUV path planning in estuary environments","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108487S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6359093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6359164,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe-ping Yan","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Zhe-ping","lastName":"Yan","id":"37533860900"},{"name":"Chao Deng","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Deng","id":"38237585300"},{"name":"Jia-jia Zhou","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Jia-jia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37088154387"},{"name":"Dong-nan Chi","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Dong-nan","lastName":"Chi","id":"38242465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6359164","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":908},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Acceleration","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Convergence","Vectors","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-subpopulation particle swarm optimization","particle swarm optimization performance improvement","group experiences","individual experience","particle swarm search space","local minimum points","search precision","stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Two-subpopulation","Learning Factor","Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06359164.pdf","startPage":"4113","endPage":"4117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel two-subpopulation particle swarm optimization","abstract":"The performance of the particle swarm is mainly influenced by individual particles experience and group experience in the period of evolution for particle swarm optimization.

Its potential applications include location sensitive billing, asset tracking, fraud protection, mobile yellow pages, fleet management, etc. Several location techniques using terrestrial wireless network elements and radio signals have been proposed over the years, but multipath propagation, multiple access interference (MAI), and non-line-of-sight propagation have impeded the accuracy in mobile station (MS) positioning. Traditional location algorithms have derived location estimates assuming single user environment. However this assumption is not correct as measurement bias is introduced due to MAI. An interference cancellation based delay locked loop (DLL) for MS delay estimation is proposed in this paper, which is subsequently used for radio location. A system model is presented and simulations are carried out that show that proposed method provides MS position location quite accurately even in the presence of MAI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subscriber location in CDMA Wireless networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359219","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 10th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338367/6357826/06359219.pdf","startPage":"4390","endPage":"4394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2012.6359219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Subscriber location in CDMA Wireless networks","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6359219/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13150695","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subscriber location in CDMA Wireless networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076665S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6359219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6359257,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37279309600"},{"name":"Pietro R.

However, the linear representation criterion for selecting the M nearest neighbors in the first phase is too computational demanding, especially when the training set as well as the number of classes is large. Therefore, more straight forward and simplified criterions for the nearest neighbor selection are considered, such as the Euclidean distance and the City-block distance. The experimental results show that the TPTSR method with the Euclidean distance and the City-block distance criterions can achieve almost the same classification performance as the linear representation; they are much more efficient in reducing the computation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359361/","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13150746","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"M-nearest neighbor selection for two-phase test sample representation in face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-nearest neighbor selection for two-phase test sample representation in face recognition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064142S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338367","isNumber":"6357826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338367","xplore-issue":"6357826","articleId":"6359361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6359371,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ge","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ge","id":"38522120300"},{"name":"Boyang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598202800"},{"name":"Ju Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279467700"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Quality Supervision and Test for Electronic and Information Products in Shandong, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38521041100"},{"name":"Feng Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Quality Supervision and Test for Electronic and Information Products in Shandong, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Feng","id":"38519729800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1398-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1397-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1396-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6359371","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Motion compensation","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Mobile communication","Hafnium","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image resolution","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["key frames based video super resolution","adaptive overlapped block motion compensation","AOBMC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video super-resolution","key frames","AOBMC"]}],"abstract":"A video super resolution algorithm is presented, which is based key frame and adaptive overlapped block motion compensation (AOBMC).

When the aspect ratio and area of target is certain, by detecting the shape feature and using template matching, we detect the location of target which was partly covered. Firstly, use Canny algorithm and morphology method to obtain the edge of objects. Then, use the improved Hough transform algorithm to extract line segments features and locate the candidate target region according to template matching. Finally, recognize and locate the target by detecting whether the two segments are connected to be a signal region. After recognizing target, the slant angle of the target is detected based on Hough transform. This method can exactly locate the target and get the angle.

It is known that there is a trade off between the imperceptibility and robustness of a digital watermarking scheme. Trying to deal with this problem, an adaptive improved singular value decomposition-based watermarking method by applying local image statistics and the genetic algorithm is presented. The local image statistics can be used not only to measure the perceptibility of watermarks once they are embedded, but also to control the perceptibility during the embedding process. Watermarking components with proper strength factors are the most critical aspect in the whole process and the genetic algorithm is employed to find the appropriate watermarking strength factors. Experimental results confirm the imperceptibility of the proposed method and its robustness against a variety of image-processing attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359595/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13169180","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6359595/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An adaptive SVD-based watermarking scheme based on genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive SVD-based watermarking scheme based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"04524462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05399S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338447","isNumber":"6359543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338447","xplore-issue":"6359543","articleId":"6359595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6359596,"authors":[{"name":"Shing-Tai Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shing-Tai Pan","id":"37528598600"},{"name":"Ching-Fa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kao Yuan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Fa Chen","id":"37539308800"},{"name":"Ying-Wei Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Wei Lee","id":"38520920700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1484-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1486-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6359596","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","quantisation (signal)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","fuzzy codebook training","speech recognition","fuzzy membership function","discrete hidden Markov model","Mandarin speech recognition","vector quantization","speech signal","speech signal recognition","GA","speech feature quantization","quantized speech statistical features","DHMM model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","Fuzzy codebook","Genetic algorithm","Hidden Markov Model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359596","abstract":"A genetic algorithm is used to train the fuzzy membership function of a fuzzy codebook for the modeling of Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM) applied to Mandarin speech recognition. Vector quantization for a speech feature based on a codebook is a fundamental process to recognize the speech signal by DHMM. A codebook with fuzzy membership functions corresponding to each vector in the codebook will be first trained by genetic algorithms (GAs) through speech features. The trained fuzzy codebook is then used to quantize the speech features. Subsequently, the quantized speech statistical features are used to model the DHMM for each speech. Besides, all the speech features to be recognized will go through the fuzzy codebook for quantization before being fed into the DHMM model for recognition. Experimental results show that both the speech recognition rate and computation time for recognition can be improved by the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359596","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1558","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359543","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338447/6359543/06359596.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm on fuzzy codebook training for speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359596/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm on fuzzy codebook training for speech recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6359596/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13169181","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm on fuzzy codebook training for speech recognition","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"04534463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067213S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338447","isNumber":"6359543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338447","xplore-issue":"6359543","articleId":"6359596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6359604,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280406100"},{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Min Lin","id":"37087067551"},{"name":"Ming-Shu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Shu Yang","id":"37087067937"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1484-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1486-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6359604","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","neurocontrollers","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary embedded recurrent fuzzy neural networks","NSRFNN","nonlinear system control","interval type-2 fuzzy systems","computational complexity","nonstationary fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System control","fuzzy logic systems","neural network","recurrent","non-stationary"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359604","abstract":"This study proposes a non-stationary embedded recurrent fuzzy neural network (NSRFNN) and its application on nonlinear system control.

Each luminaire: 1) consists of a light-emitting diode (LED) based light source dimmable by a local controller; 2) is actuated based on sensing information from a presence sensor, that determines occupant presence, and a light sensor, that measures illuminance, within their respective fields of view; and 3) a communication module to exchange control information within a local neighborhood. We consider distributed illumination control in such an intelligent lighting system to achieve presence-adaptive and daylight-integrated spatial illumination rendering. The rendering is specified as target values at the light sensors, and under these constraints, a local controller has to determine the optimum dimming levels of its associated LED luminaire so that the power consumed in rendering is minimized. The formulated optimization problem is a distributed linear programming problem with constraints on exchanging control information within a neighborhood. A distributed optimization algorithm is presented to solve this problem and its stability and convergence are studied. Sufficient conditions, in terms of parameter selection, under which the algorithm can achieve a feasible solution are provided. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in an indoor office setting in terms of achieved illuminance rendering and power savings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6423230/06359739.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2228850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2228850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Illumination Control With Local Sensing and Actuation in Networked Lighting Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Sensors","Rendering (computer graphics)","Lighting control","Light emitting diodes","Optimization","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light emitting diodes","lighting control","linear programming","optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed illumination control","local sensing","networked lighting systems","illumination control","light-emitting diode luminaire","light source","local controller","sensing information","light sensor","communication module","local neighborhood","intelligent lighting system","presence-adaptive spatial illumination rendering","daylight-integrated spatial illumination rendering","LED luminaire","formulated optimization problem","distributed linear programming problem","distributed optimization algorithm","indoor office setting","power savings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Daylight and occupancy adaptive lighting","distributed lighting systems","distributed sensing and light actuation","lighting control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Illumination Control With Local Sensing and Actuation in Networked Lighting Systems","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13287778","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Illumination Control With Local Sensing and Actuation in Networked Lighting Systems","sourcePdf":"jsen-pandharipande-2228850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052558S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6423230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"98","articleId":"6359739","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6359750,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz P.

Recently, closed-form expression for this discrete Green's function (DGF) was derived, which facilitates its applications in the FDTD simulations of radiation and scattering problems. Unfortunately, implementation of the new DGF formula in software requires a multiple precision arithmetic and may cause long runtimes. Therefore, we propose an acceleration of the DGF computations on a GPU employing the multiple precision arithmetic and the CUDA technology. We have achieved sixfold speedup relative to the reference DGF code executed on a multicore central processing unit. Results indicate that GPUs also represent an inexpensive source of computational power for accelerated DGF computations requiring the multiple precision arithmetic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06359750.pdf","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2012.2229380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2012.2229380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of FDTD-Compatible Green's Function on Graphics Processing Unit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Finite difference methods","Libraries","Indexes","Time domain analysis","Antennas","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","graphics processing units","Green's function methods","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD-compatible Green's function","graphics processing unit","finite-difference time domain","GPU","discrete Green's function","radiation problem","scattering problem","multiple precision arithmetic","CUDA technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational electromagnetics","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","Green's function methods","parallel processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of FDTD-Compatible Green's Function on Graphics Processing Unit","volume":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6359750/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2012","accessionNumber":"13182201","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of FDTD-Compatible Green's Function on Graphics Processing Unit","sourcePdf":"lawp-stefanski-2229380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147782S","chronDate":"2012","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6170612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6170612","articleId":"6359750","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6359751,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Hua Wang","affiliation":["Optical and Electromagnetic Research State Key Laboratory of MOI, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900807800"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Center for Optical and Electromagnetic Research State Key Laboratory of MOI, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37278303000"},{"name":"Zhizhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37335571800"},{"name":"Shun-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Shun-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086802494"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6359751","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A one-step leapfrog alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method including lumped elements is presented.

Compared to previously developed RSFQ ALUs, this unit features an extensive set of 8 arithmetic and 12 logical operations. The execution of ALU operations consists of two steps. First, when necessary, one or both operands are inverted, and then operations are performed on these pre-processed data. Unlike the RSFQ Kogge-Stone-based designs, our parallel-prefix sparse-tree ALU has significantly reduced circuit complexity while maintaining robust operational margins at high frequency. An 8-bit ALU has been implemented with the International Superconductivity Technology Center (ISTEC) 10 kA/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n 1.0 \u03bcm 9-metal ADP2.1 fabrication process as a joint effort between Stony Brook University, Yokohama National University, and Nagoya University.

The 8-bit ALU core (without SFQ-to-dc and dc-to-SFQ converters) consists of 8832 Josephson junctions with an area of 7.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The acceleration of high intensity proton and heavy ion beams requires 4.5 T magnets, up to 7.8 m long, to be ramped up at a rate of 1 T/s. These challenging magnets have also the particular characteristic to be geometrically curved with a sagitta of 114 mm. To demonstrate the feasibility of curved fast cycled cos-theta dipoles, R&D activities were performed at the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics. Important steps of the R&D have been: 1) the development of a low loss superconducting Rutherford cable; 2) the construction of coil winding models for assessing the constructive feasibility of curved coils; and 3) the construction and tests of a complete model magnet composed of a cold mass enclosed in its horizontal cryostat. During 2012 the cold mass was tested at Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics-LASA in a vertical cryostat. The paper discusses the main issues of the R&D activity from design to manufacture, results, future developments, and future perspectives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359778/","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13196527","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","externalId":"4000505","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Curved Fast Ramped Superconducting Dipoles for FAIR SIS300 Synchrotron: From First Model to Future Developments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Curved Fast Ramped Superconducting Dipoles for FAIR SIS300 Synchrotron: From First Model to Future Developments","sourcePdf":"tasc-fabbricatore-2229332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09085S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"6366257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6366257","articleId":"6359778","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6359793,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Rosa","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics, CNRS-UMR 7222, Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Rosa","id":"38542454300"},{"name":"Mustafa Suphi Erden","affiliation":["Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mustafa Suphi","lastName":"Erden","id":"38577478400"},{"name":"Tom Vercauteren","affiliation":["Mauna Kea Technologies, France"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Vercauteren","id":"37283803200"},{"name":"Beno\u00eet Herman","affiliation":["Center for Research in Mechatronics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Herman","id":"37947592800"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Szewczyk","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics, CNRS-UMR 7222, Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, Paris, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Szewczyk","id":"37541684100"},{"name":"Guillaume Morel","affiliation":["Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics, CNRS-UMR 7222, Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Morel","id":"37274022000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6359793","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Real-time systems","Trajectory","Robot kinematics","Visual servoing","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","medical image processing","medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["confocal edomicroscopic image mosaic","visual servoing","probe-tissue contact","image trajectory","robotic device","probe motion control","real-time endomicroscopic image","high-accuracy industrial robot","minimally invasive device","ex vivo tissue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical image processing","confocal endomicroscopy","image mosaicking","medical robotics","visual servoing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Biomechanical Phenomena","Chickens","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Microscopy, Confocal","Microscopy, Confocal","Muscle, Skeletal","Robotics","Robotics","Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive","Video Recording"]}],"abstract":"Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy provides real-time microscopic images of tissues contacted by a small probe that can be inserted in vivo through a minimally invasive access. Mosaicking consists in sweeping the probe in contact with a tissue to be imaged while collecting the video stream, and process the images to assemble them in a large mosaic. While most of the literature in this field has focused on image processing, little attention has been paid so far to the way the probe motion can be controlled. This is a crucial issue since the precision of the probe trajectory control drastically influences the quality of the final mosaic. Robotically controlled motion has the potential of providing enough precision to perform mosaicking. In this paper, we emphasize the difficulties of implementing such an approach. First, probe-tissue contacts generate deformations that prevent from properly controlling the image trajectory. Second, in the context of minimally invasive procedures targeted by our research, robotic devices are likely to exhibit limited quality of the distal probe motion control at the microscopic scale. To cope with these problems visual servoing from real-time endomicroscopic images is proposed in this paper. It is implemented on two different devices (a high-accuracy industrial robot and a prototype minimally invasive device). Experiments on different kinds of environments (printed paper and ex vivo tissues) show that the quality of the visually servoed probe motion is sufficient to build mosaics with minimal distortion in spite of disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2228859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6480808/06359793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2228859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6480808","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Large Mosaics of Confocal Edomicroscopic Images Using Visual Servoing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Building Large Mosaics of Confocal Edomicroscopic Images Using Visual Servoing","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13382138","pubMedId":"23192481","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6359793/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building Large Mosaics of Confocal Edomicroscopic Images Using Visual Servoing","sourcePdf":"tbme-rosa-2228859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099389S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6480808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6480808","articleId":"6359793","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6359797,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen P.

The platform consists of two highly novel subsystems: one is a micropositioning mechanism which can deliver 1 ml of targeted medication and the other is a holding mechanism, which gives the functionality of resisting peristalsis. The micropositioning mechanism allows a needle to be positioned within a 22.5\u00b0 segment of a cylindrical capsule and be extendible by up to 1.5 mm outside the capsule body. The mechanism achieves both these functions using only a single micromotor and occupying a total volume of just 200 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.

Due to the natural variability of anatomical structures, statistical shape model has been widely applied in medical image segmentation. Robust and distinctive local features are critical for statistical shape model to achieve accurate segmentation results. The scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) has been employed to capture the information of the local patch surrounding the boundary. However, when SIFT feature being used for segmentation, the scale and variance are not specified with the location of the point of interest. To deal with it, the discriminant analysis in machine learning is introduced to measure the distinctiveness of the learned SIFT features for each landmark directly and to make the scale and variance adaptive to the locations. As the gray values and gradients vary significantly over the boundary of the prostate, separate appearance descriptors are built for each landmark and then optimized. After that, a two stage coarse-to-fine segmentation approach is carried out by incorporating the local shape variations. Finally, the experiments on prostate segmentation from MR image are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2228644","startPage":"479","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2228644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6413218/06359798.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prostate Segmentation in MR Images Using Discriminant Boundary Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359798/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prostate Segmentation in MR Images Using Discriminant Boundary Features","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6359798/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13234673","pubMedId":"23192474","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prostate Segmentation in MR Images Using Discriminant Boundary Features","sourcePdf":"tbme-yan-2228644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099774S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6413218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6413218","articleId":"6359798","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6359799,"authors":[{"name":"Youngchun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6359799/6359799-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngchun Kim received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

Assuming that each input has an unknown sparse representation in known dictionaries, we find that multi-channel information can be sampled with a single ADC. The proposed ADC architecture consists of a mixed signal block and a digital signal processing (DSP) block. The channel inputs are sampled by switched-capacitor-based sample-and-hold circuits, and then mixed using sequences of plus or minus ones, leading to no bandwidth expansion. The resulting discrete-time signals are converted to digital sequences by a single ADC or quantizer. At the DSP block, each channel is separated from the digitized mixture through various separation algorithms that are widely used in compressive sensing. For this, we study several techniques for separating the mixture of the channel inputs into the sample number of digital sequences corresponding to each channel. We show that with an ideal ADC, perfect reconstruction of the signals is possible if the input signals are sufficiently sparse.

The incorporation of appropriate models into numerical simulators is necessary in order to take advantage of these properties.

The use of vector-fitting techniques expands the permittivity of graphene into a rational function series of complex conjugate pole-residue pairs, which is implemented into FDTD by an auxiliary differential equation formulation.

To select the optimal location of the SFCL, the sensitivity analysis of the angular separation of the rotors of synchronous machines present in the power system is introduced. The optimal location of the SFCL in EPG is coordinated with the corresponding optimal resistive value to improve transient stability and low-frequency oscillation damping performance of the system. It is shown that the SFCL can have different impacts (positive and negative) in function of its location in the EPG when a fault occurs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the IEEE benchmarked four-machine two-area test system is used to carry out several case studies. The results show that the optimal location of SFCL combined with its optimal resistive value reduces the angular separation of the rotors that improves effectively the system stability during a fault.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06359816.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to determine the optimal location of SFCL in electric power grid to improve power system stability","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2224386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2224386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to determine the optimal location of SFCL in electric power grid to improve power system stability","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934097","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6359816/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to determine the optimal location of SFCL in electric power grid to improve power system stability","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-didier-2224386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050671S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6359816","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6359848,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhou Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6359848/6359848-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenzhou Lu (S\u201909) received the B.Sc. degree from Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, China, in 2007.

With parallel structure, categorized harmonic frequency internal models are connected in parallel. Each categorized internal model has its own independent control gain and PSRC can optimize the total convergence rate by tuning the control gains independently according to the harmonic distribution. Compared with a multiresonant controller, PSRC has more compact structure and yields much less computation burden. Compared with conventional repetitive control (CRC), PSRC can achieve a much faster dynamic response without any loss of tracking accuracy or any added data memory. Moreover, PSRC is a general parallel structure RC for housing various existing RC, such as CRC, odd-harmonic RC, and dual-mode-structure RC. Experimental results of the PSRC-controlled three-phase dc-ac PWM converters show the validity and advantages of the proposed PSRC scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359848/","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6359848/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13245008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A General Parallel Structure Repetitive Control Scheme for Multiphase DC\u2013AC PWM Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Parallel Structure Repetitive Control Scheme for Multiphase DC\u2013AC PWM Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-lu-2229395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111814S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6359848","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6359868,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Cempini","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6428720/6359868/6359868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Cempini (S\u201911) received the M.Sc. degree in aeronautical engineering (cum laude) from both the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, and from Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, in 2010.

These devices are designed to be used in direct contact with the user to aid with movement or increase the power of specific skeletal joints. The design of the so-called physical human-robot interface is critical, since it determines not only the efficacy of the robot but the kinematic compatibility of the device with the human skeleton and the degree of adaptation to different anthropometries as well. Failing to deal with these problems causes misalignments between the robot and the user joint. Axes misalignment leads to the impossibility of controlling the torque effectively transmitted to the user joint and causes undesired loading forces on articulations and soft tissues. In this paper, we propose a general analytical method for the design of exoskeletons able to assist human joints without being subjected to misalignment effects. This method is based on a kinetostatic analysis of a coupled mechanism (robot-human skeleton) and can be applied in the design of self-aligning mechanisms. The method is exemplified in the design of an assistive robotic chain for a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) human articulation.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2226381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6428720/06359868.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2226381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Alignment Mechanisms for Assistive Wearable Robots: A Kinetostatic Compatibility Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Self-Alignment Mechanisms for Assistive Wearable Robots: A Kinetostatic Compatibility Method","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6359868/","accessionNumber":"13270796","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Alignment Mechanisms for Assistive Wearable Robots: A Kinetostatic Compatibility Method","sourcePdf":"tro-cempini-2226381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11361S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6428720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6428720","articleId":"6359868","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6359870,"authors":[{"name":"Yichao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Corporate Research and Development, Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6417036/6359870/6359870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yichao Huang (S'10\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering with highest honors from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2008, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","He then joined Qualcomm, Corporate R&D, San Diego, CA.

Homogeneous feedback design with a common subband size is not aware of the heterogeneous channel statistics among users. Under a general correlated channel model, we demonstrate the gain of matching the subband size to the underlying channel statistics motivating heterogeneous feedback design with different subband sizes and feedback resources across clusters of users. Employing the best-M partial feedback strategy, users with smaller subband size would convey more partial feedback to match the frequency selectivity. In order to develop an analytical framework to investigate the impact of partial feedback and potential imperfections, we leverage the multi-cluster subband fading model. The perfect feedback scenario is thoroughly analyzed, and the closed form expression for the average sum rate is derived for the heterogeneous partial feedback system. We proceed to examine the effect of imperfections due to channel estimation error and feedback delay, which leads to additional consideration of system outage. Two transmission strategies: the fix rate and the variable rate, are considered for the outage analysis. We also investigate how to adapt to the imperfections in order to maximize the average goodput under heterogeneous partial feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Heterogeneous Feedback Design in an OFDMA Downlink With Partial and Imperfect Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2229275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6417036/06359870.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2229275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6417036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Heterogeneous Feedback Design in an OFDMA Downlink With Partial and Imperfect Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6359870/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13256062","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Heterogeneous Feedback Design in an OFDMA Downlink With Partial and Imperfect Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2229275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120057S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6417036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6417036","articleId":"6359870","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6359871,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6451284/6359871/6359871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongwei Huang (M'09) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computation science and the M.Sc. degree in operations research, both from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in 2005.","Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a Visiting Researcher of the Department of Biomedical, Electronic, and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d Italy, and a Research Associate with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

It is in the form of a semi-infinite second-order cone program (SOCP) and, more importantly, it possesses an equivalent and explicit convex reformulation, due to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) description of the cone of Lorentz-positive maps. Hence, the conservative robust beamforming problem can be efficiently solved by an optimization solver.

The system model encompasses 1) a Demodulate-and-Forward (DemF) protocol at the relays, where the received packets are forwarded, regardless of their reliability, and 2) a maximum-likelihood optimum demodulator at the destination, which accounts for possible demodulation errors at the relays. An asymptotically tight and closed-form expression of the end-to-end error probability is derived, which showcases the diversity order and coding gain of each source. Unlike other papers available in the literature, the proposed framework has three main distinguishable features: 1) It is useful for general network topologies and arbitrary binary encoding vectors; 2) it shows how network code and two-hop forwarding protocol affect diversity order and coding gain; and 3) it accounts for realistic fading channels and demodulation errors at the relays. The framework provides four main conclusions: 1) Each source achieves a diversity order equal to the separation vector of the network code; 2) the design of diversity-achieving network codes is equivalent to the design of systematic block codes over fully interleaved point-to-point links; 3) the coding gain of each source decreases with the number of mixed packets at the relays; and 4) if the destination cannot take into account demodulation errors at the relays, it loses approximately half of the diversity order. Our theoretical findings are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2229476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06359873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2229476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Diversity Order and Coding Gain of Multisource Multirelay Cooperative Wireless Networks With Binary Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Diversity Order and Coding Gain of Multisource Multirelay Cooperative Wireless Networks With Binary Network Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371637","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Diversity Order and Coding Gain of Multisource Multirelay Cooperative Wireless Networks With Binary Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tvt-direnzo-2229476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094126S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","articleId":"6359873","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6359874,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuliang Xie","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6359874/6359874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiuliang Xie received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2011, both with high honors.","He is currently with Digital TV National Engineering Laboratory Co., Ltd., Beijing, where he is engaged in developing China\u2019s next-generation broadcasting standard.

It is shown that the channel capacity can be approached by the proposed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-APSK constellation as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n tends to infinity.

To fully exploit the benefits of heterogeneous networks, proper mobile association, interference management, and radio resource management schemes need to be developed. In this paper, we investigate radio resource allocation for heterogeneous networks with cooperative relays, where the relay nodes (RNs) with in-band backhaul act as micro BSs and are able to serve user equipment (UE) either independently or cooperatively with the BSs. In such a network, radio resource-allocation schemes need to decide for each resource block: 1) whether a UE is served by a BS or an RN, and 2) whether a UE should be cooperatively served or not. In making these decisions, radio resource consumption on RN's in-band backhaul links and fairness among the UEs should be taken into consideration, which further complicates the resource-allocation problem. In this paper, we propose a radio resource-allocation framework and derive a resource-allocation strategy that is asymptotically optimal on the proportional fairness metric. The derived resource-allocation scheme gives insights on the optimal radio resource allocation for the heterogeneous networks with cooperative RNs using in-band backhauls.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2228511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1784","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06359877.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2228511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intracell Cooperation and Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Network With Relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication","Downlink","Relays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","interference (signal)","Long Term Evolution","radio networks","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intracell cooperation","resource allocation","heterogeneous network","relays","macro base stations","micro base stations","wireless networks","fourth-generation-Long-Term Evolution","4G-LTE","mobile association","interference management","radio resource management","user equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated multipoint (CoMP)","convex optimization","heterogeneous networks","in-band backhaul","LTE-A","proportional fairness","radio resource management (RRM)","relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Intracell Cooperation and Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Network With Relays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6359877/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13487025","publicationDate":"May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intracell Cooperation and Resource Allocation in a Heterogeneous Network With Relays","sourcePdf":"tvt-hu-2228511-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093199S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6359877","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6359881,"authors":[{"name":"Changqiao Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Institute of Sensing Technology and Business, Institute of Sensing Technology and Business, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6530672/6359881/6359881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changqiao Xu (M'02) received the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), Beijing, China, in January 2009.","He was an Assistant Research Fellow with ISCAS from 2002 to 2007, where he was the Research and Development Project Manager in area communication networks.

This service is similar to the cable or satellite TV already in the home, and user-centric interactive mobile Video-on-Demand (VoD) over urban vehicular networks is in fact expected. However, providing this new service with focus on user Quality of Experience (QoE) constitutes a significant challenge. This paper introduces a QoE-driven User-centric solution for VoD services in urban vehicular network environments (QUVoD). QUVoD relies on a multihomed hierarchical peer-to-peer (P2P) and vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) architecture. Vehicles construct a low-layer VANET via Wireless Access in the Vehicular Environment interfaces; they also form an upper layer P2P Chord overlay on top of a cellular network via Fourth-Generation (4G) interfaces. A novel grouping-based storage strategy that uniformly distributes the video segments along the Chord overlay is proposed, reducing segment seeking traffic while also enabling load balancing. A novel segment seeking and multipath delivery scheme that achieves high lookup success rate and very good video data delivery efficiency is also introduced, which achieves high lookup success rate and very good video data delivery efficiency. Furthermore, a new speculation-based prefetching strategy is proposed, which analyses users' interactive viewing behavior and, by estimating video segment playback order, employs prefetching of the expected segments, smoothening the video playback. Simulation results show how QUVoD is a highly efficient user-centric mobile VoD solution in urban vehicular networks in comparison with existing state-of-the-art solutions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2228682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530672","startPage":"2273","endPage":"2289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6530672/06359881.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-Driven User-Centric VoD Services in Urban Multihomed P2P-Based Vehicular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359881/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"QoE-Driven User-Centric VoD Services in Urban Multihomed P2P-Based Vehicular Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2013","accessionNumber":"13563733","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-Driven User-Centric VoD Services in Urban Multihomed P2P-Based Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-muntean-2228682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147126S","chronDate":"Jun  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6530672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6530672","articleId":"6359881","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6359882,"authors":[{"name":"Paschalis C.

This paper investigates the performance of an energy detector over generalized \u03ba-\u03bc and \u03ba- \u03bc extreme fading channels, which have been shown to provide remarkably accurate fading characterization. Novel analytic expressions are firstly derived for the corresponding average probability of detection for the case of single-user detection. These results are subsequently extended to the case of square-law selection (SLS) diversity and for collaborative detection scenarios. As expected, the performance of the detector is highly dependent upon the severity of fading since even small variations of the fading conditions affect significantly the value of the average probability of detection. Furthermore, the performance of the detector improves substantially as the number of branches or collaborating users increase in both severe and moderate fading conditions, whereas it is shown that the \u03ba- \u03bc extreme model is capable of accounting for fading variations even at low signal-to-noise values. The offered results are particularly useful in assessing the effect of fading in ED-based cognitive radio communication systems; therefore, they can be used in quantifying the associated tradeoffs between sensing performance and energy efficiency in cognitive radio networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06359882.pdf","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2228680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2228680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing Over - and - Extreme Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","diversity reception","fading channels","probability","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection based spectrum sensing","sensing technique","extreme fading channel","fading characterization","average probability","single-user detection","square-law selection diversity","SLS diversity","collaborative detection","fading variation","signal-to-noise value","ED-based cognitive radio communication system","sensing performance","energy efficiency","cognitive radio network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collaborative spectrum sensing","diversity","energy detector","fading channels","$\\kappa{-}\\mu$  fading","spectrum sensing","unknown signal detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing Over <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa{-}\\mu$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa{-}\\mu$</tex></formula> Extreme Fading Channels","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371641","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing Over <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa{-}\\mu$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa{-}\\mu$</tex></formula> Extreme Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-sofotasios-2228680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047876S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"129","articleId":"6359882","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6359886,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Network Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6359886/6359886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Wang (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008.

In the analytical framework, we consider the important lower-layer mechanisms and settings, including spectrum sensing errors, medium-access control (MAC) protocols, link adaptation technologies such as adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ), and limited buffer size. By modeling the queue dynamics as a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (FSMC), we derive the analytical expressions of the average queue length, packet-dropping rate, and packet-collision rate. Based on these expressions, the QoS metrics including average queueing delay, packet-loss rate, and effective throughput are obtained. Simulation and numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical framework and investigate the QoS performance of SUs.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2229475","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06359886.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2229475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Queue Dynamics of Multiuser Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Queue Dynamics of Multiuser Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359886/","volume":"62","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6359886/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371642","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Queue Dynamics of Multiuser Multichannel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2229475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090653S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6479353","articleId":"6359886","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6359888,"authors":[{"name":"Zongwei Wu","affiliation":["Xian Research Institute of High Technology, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6359888/6359888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zongwei Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Xi'an Research Institute of High Technology, Xi'an, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.","His research interests include attitude determination, vehicle electronics, nonlinear filtering, and mobile satellite communication."]},"firstName":"Zongwei","lastName":"Wu","id":"38575713500"},{"name":"Minli Yao","affiliation":["Xian Research Institute of High Technology, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6479353/6359888/6359888-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Minli Yao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xi'an Research Institute of High Technology, Xi'an, China, in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, in 1999, all in electronic engineering.","He worked on code-division multiple access (CDMA) with ZTE Mobile Telecom as a Team Leader for two years.

An adaptive Euler-angle-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is utilized to fuse these sensors to guard against the effects induced by GPS outages and vehicle accelerations. When the two-antenna GPS can provide the vehicle yaw angle, the vehicle accelerations that introduce large errors to the accelerometer-measured gravitational acceleration can be corrected by the GPS-measured velocity and sideslip angle. When the two-antenna GPS fails to provide the yaw angle and needed information, the yaw angle is estimated only by integrating gyroscopes. The estimation of the pitch and roll angles is adaptively controlled by the vehicle acceleration detection rules. These rules make full use of the gyroscope output and the filtering results, which are more compatible with vehicle use than conventional accelerometer norm-based rule. The proposed method is verified with driving tests, suggesting that this technique is a viable candidate for low-cost SOTM.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2229306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2229306","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1096","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6479353/06359888.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Cost Antenna Attitude Estimation by Fusing Inertial Sensing and Two-Antenna GPS for Vehicle-Mounted Satcom-on-the-Move","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Low-Cost Antenna Attitude Estimation by Fusing Inertial Sensing and Two-Antenna GPS for Vehicle-Mounted Satcom-on-the-Move","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6359888/","accessionNumber":"13371643","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359888/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Cost Antenna Attitude Estimation by Fusing Inertial Sensing and Two-Antenna GPS for Vehicle-Mounted Satcom-on-the-Move","sourcePdf":"tvt-wu-2229306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081059S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6479353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6479353","articleId":"6359888","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6359894,"authors":[{"name":"Zana Ghaderi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Zana Ghaderi received the B.Sc. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from Sharif University, Tehran, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, both in computer engineering.","He has been a Research Assistant with the Dependable System Laboratory, Sharif University since September 2011.

Previous mitigation techniques to protect SRDs impose significant area and power overheads. Additionally, they suffer from susceptibility of configuration bits to multiple bit upsets (MBUs). In this paper, we present a highly available fault-tolerant architecture to protect SRD-based designs against MBUs in both configuration and user bits. In the proposed architecture, the entire design is duplicated with respect to the relative locations of logic blocks within the SRD and the main and replica flip-flops (FFs) are compared at each clock cycle to detect any possible mismatch. In addition, the unused FFs available throughout SRDs are employed as history FFs to save the latest correct state of the system. Upon detection of any mismatch between the main and replica FFs, the system is able to roll back to the latest correct state stored in the history FFs. The simulation results extracted using fault injection experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides both higher reliability and availability, as compared with the traditional triple modular redundancy techniques, while offering less area and power overheads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAFTA: Highly Available Fault-Tolerant Architecture to Protect SRAM-Based Reconfigurable Devices Against Multiple Bit Upsets","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2012.2229710","startPage":"203","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2012.2229710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/6472755/06359894.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"HAFTA: Highly Available Fault-Tolerant Architecture to Protect SRAM-Based Reconfigurable Devices Against Multiple Bit Upsets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6359894/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13355913","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAFTA: Highly Available Fault-Tolerant Architecture to Protect SRAM-Based Reconfigurable Devices Against Multiple Bit Upsets","sourcePdf":"tdmr-asadi-2229710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090164S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6472755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6472755","articleId":"6359894","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6359898,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Guglielmi","affiliation":["Department Energy, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6413287/6359898/6359898-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Guglielmi (M'07) was born in Imperia, Italy, in 1970.

This issue is particularly critical when low carrier-fundamental frequency ratios are used such as in aerospace applications, where high fundamental frequencies exist. A three-phase multilevel active shunt filter with a low switching frequency is proposed to mitigate the lowest order carrier-frequency terms. However, low carrier frequencies lead to reference voltage phase delay and attenuation and can introduce significant baseband harmonics. These effects cannot be hidden by employing multiple modulator converters. In addressing these problems, an improved modulation approach is proposed in this work that allows duty cycle updating (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n - 1) times per switching period for each H-bridge of one phase of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n -level converter [rather than only once or twice as in the regularly sampled pulse width modulation (PWM)]. The proposed modulation approach is then combined with predictive current control in order to enhance the system performance. The control loop performance compared to regularly sampled PWM is verified through simulations and experimentally by employing a three-phase five-level active shunt power filters in a 400-Hz power network.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2012.2229253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6413287/06359905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2012.2229253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413287","startPage":"159","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Carrier\u2013Fundamental Frequency Ratio PWM for Multilevel Active Shunt Power Filters for Aerospace Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Carrier\u2013Fundamental Frequency Ratio PWM for Multilevel Active Shunt Power Filters for Aerospace Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234801","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6359905/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Carrier\u2013Fundamental Frequency Ratio PWM for Multilevel Active Shunt Power Filters for Aerospace Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-odavic-2229253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107823S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6413287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6413287","articleId":"6359905","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6359911,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Toma","affiliation":["SPE Laboratory (UMR CNRS 6134), University of Corsica, Corte, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6512583/6359911/6359911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samuel Toma was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1987.

The single type of short-circuits tested by the proposed approach is based on turn-to-turn fault which is known as the first stage of insulation degradation. Used input/output data have been binary coded in order to reduce the computation complexity. A new procedure, namely addition and mean of the set of same rank, has been implemented to eliminate the redundancy due to the periodic character of input signals. However, this approach has a great impact on the statistical properties on the processed data in terms of richness and of statistical distribution. The proposed neural network has been trained and tested with experimental signals coming from six current sensors implemented around a setup with a prime mover and a 5.5 kW wound-rotor three-phase induction generator. Both stator and rotor windings have been modified in order to sort out first and last turns in each phase. The experimental results highlight the superiority of using this new procedure in both training and testing modes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wound-Rotor Induction Generator Inter-Turn Short-Circuits Diagnosis Using a New Digital Neural Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2012.2229675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6512583/06359911.pdf","startPage":"4043","endPage":"4052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2012.2229675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wound-Rotor Induction Generator Inter-Turn Short-Circuits Diagnosis Using a New Digital Neural Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6359911/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13484421","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wound-Rotor Induction Generator Inter-Turn Short-Circuits Diagnosis Using a New Digital Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tie-capocchi-2229675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128661S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6512583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6512583","articleId":"6359911","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6359912,"authors":[{"name":"Amir H.

Previous research on sketch recognition focused on matching sketches drawn by professional artists who either looked directly at the subjects (viewed sketches) or used a verbal description of the subject's appearance as provided by an eyewitness (forensic sketches). Unlike sketches hand drawn by artists, composite sketches are synthesized using one of the several facial composite software systems available to law enforcement agencies. We propose a component-based representation (CBR) approach to measure the similarity between a composite sketch and mugshot photograph. Specifically, we first automatically detect facial landmarks in composite sketches and face photos using an active shape model (ASM). Features are then extracted for each facial component using multiscale local binary patterns (MLBPs), and per component similarity is calculated. Finally, the similarity scores obtained from individual facial components are fused together, yielding a similarity score between a composite sketch and a face photo. Matching performance is further improved by filtering the large gallery of mugshot images using gender information. Experimental results on matching 123 composite sketches against two galleries with 10,123 and 1,316 mugshots show that the proposed method achieves promising performance (rank-100 accuracies of 77.2% and 89.4%, respectively) compared to a leading commercial face recognition system (rank-100 accuracies of 22.8% and 52.0%) and densely sampled MLBP on holistic faces (rank-100 accuracies of 27.6% and 10.6%). We believe our prototype system will be of great value to law enforcement agencies in apprehending suspects in a timely fashion.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2228856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6392970/06359918.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2228856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching Composite Sketches to Face Photos: A Component-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359918/","displayDocTitle":"Matching Composite Sketches to Face Photos: A Component-Based Approach","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13190868","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6359918/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching Composite Sketches to Face Photos: A Component-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tifs-han-2228856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17011S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6392970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"6392970","articleId":"6359918","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6359919,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Soltanmohammadi","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6392970/6359919/6359919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erfan Soltanmohammadi (S'12) was born in Karaj, Iran, in 1984.

In this paper, we consider the problem of decentralized detection in wireless sensor networks in the presence of one or more classes of misbehaving nodes. Binary hypothesis testing is considered where the honest nodes transmit their binary decisions to the fusion center (FC), while the misbehaving nodes transmit fictitious messages. The goal of the FC is to identify the misbehaving nodes and to detect the state of nature. We identify each class of nodes with an operating point (false alarm and detection probabilities) on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Maximum likelihood estimation of the nodes' operating points is then formulated and solved using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with the nodes' identities as latent variables. The solution from the EM algorithm is then used to classify the nodes and to solve the decentralized hypothesis testing problem. Numerical results compared with those from the reputation-based schemes show a significant improvement in both classification of the nodes and hypothesis testing results. We also discuss an inherent ambiguity in the node classification problem which can be resolved if the honest nodes are in majority.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2229274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6392970/06359919.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2229274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","startPage":"205","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Hypothesis Testing in Wireless Sensor Networks in the Presence of Misbehaving Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Hypothesis Testing in Wireless Sensor Networks in the Presence of Misbehaving Nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359919/","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6359919/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13190869","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Hypothesis Testing in Wireless Sensor Networks in the Presence of Misbehaving Nodes","sourcePdf":"tifs-naraghipour-2229274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096444S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6392970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6392970","articleId":"6359919","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6359920,"authors":[{"name":"Mar\u00eda Brox","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, University of C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6359920/6359920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mar\u00eda Brox received the B.Sc. degree (with honors) in physics from the University of C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 2008.","From 2005 to 2007, she held a postgraduate fellowship from the Spanish Government with the Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla (IMSE-CNM-CSIC), Seville, Spain.

Benefits of process buses include facilitating the use of nonconventional instrument transformers, improved disturbance recording and phasor measurement, and the removal of costly, and potentially hazardous, copper cabling from substation switchyards and control rooms. This paper examines the role a process bus plays in an IEC 61850\u2013based substation automation system. Measurements taken from a process bus substation are used to develop an understanding of the network characteristics of \u201cwhole of substation\u201d process buses. The concept of \u201ccoherent transmission\u201d is presented, and the impact of this on Ethernet switches is examined. Experiments based on substation observations are used to investigate in detail the behavior of Ethernet switches with sampled value traffic. Test methods that can be used to assess the adequacy of a network are proposed, and examples of the application and interpretation of these tests are provided. Once sampled value frames are queued by an Ethernet switch, the additional delay incurred by subsequent switches is minimal, and this allows their use in switchyards to further reduce communications cabling, without significantly impacting operation. The performance and reliability of a process bus network operating close to the theoretical maximum number of digital sampling units (merging units or electronic instrument transformers) was investigated with networking equipment from several vendors and has been demonstrated to be acceptable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359922/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706455","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of IEC 61850 Sampled Value Process Bus Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of IEC 61850 Sampled Value Process Bus Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-ingram-2228874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071581S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6359922","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6359924,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Kennel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6359924/6359924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabian Kennel received the Dipl.-Ing. degree from the University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Control Systems.","His current research interests include model predictive control, robust control, convex/nonlinear optimization, online/offline identification, and modeling and control of fluid dynamics."]},"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Kennel","id":"37085371952"},{"name":"Daniel G\u00f6rges","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6582568/6359924/6359924-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel G\u00f6rges (S'07\u2013M'10) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.-Ing. degrees from the University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","Since 2011, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Institute of Control Systems, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany.

The main component is the HiMPC, which allows covering different time scales, regarding constraints (e.g. power ratings) and predictions (e.g. on renewable generation), as well as rejecting disturbances (e.g. due to fluctuating renewable generation) based on a systematic model- and optimization-based design. For the electric vehicle integration, an aggregator is proposed as link between HiMPC and individual vehicle. The aggregator in particular provides predictions to the HiMPC on the availability of electric vehicles for LFC based on the current mobility demand and the statistical mobility behavior of the vehicle users. Throughout the paper, the energy management system is evaluated for the smart grid of an intermediate city.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2228876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6582568/06359924.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2228876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Management for Smart Grids With Electric Vehicles Based on Hierarchical MPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359924/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management for Smart Grids With Electric Vehicles Based on Hierarchical MPC","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706434","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6359924/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management for Smart Grids With Electric Vehicles Based on Hierarchical MPC","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2228876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076086S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6359924","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6359925,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Sch\u00fctz","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Institute of Automation and Information Systems, Garching, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6631519/6359925/6359925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Sch\u00fctz received the degree in mechatronics from the University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany, in 2009.

Since most clutters do not participate in the complex weight computation of particle PHD filter, better real-time performance can be achieved. The tracking performance is also improved because the survival measurements are used for survival targets and the spontaneous birth measurements are used for spontaneous birth targets, resulting in less interference from each other and from clutters.

The availability and stability of each link in MACNets highly depends on not only the relative movement of neighbor nodes but also the adjacent communication among primary nodes and among cognitive nodes. In multihop and multiflow MACNets, this problem becomes even worse because multiple links potentially interfere with each other. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer distributed approach, called mobility-prediction-based joint stable routing and channel assignment (MP-JSRCA), to maximize the network throughput by jointly selecting stable routes and assigning channels avoiding inter- and intra-flow interferences based on mobility prediction. To quantitatively measure the communication quality of links, we propose a new metric data transmission cost (DTC) that captures node mobility, impact to primary nodes, and channel conflict among cognitive nodes. In our MP-JSRCA, each relay node selects the best link with the smallest DTC as the next hop, within a specified sector region towards the destination.

Given some simulation or experimental output data of a nonlinear system, the nCOS function of the system can be accurately determined up to any high nonlinear orders with less simulation trials and computation cost compared with a pure simulation-based study or traditional theoretical computations. Moreover, the method can also be used to accurately determine the linear and nonlinear components in the nonlinear output frequency response (or an output spectrum) of a nonlinear system.

The proposed method generates multiple textured meshes from multiple RGB-Depth streams, applies a coarse-to-fine registration algorithm and finally merges the separate meshes into a single 3-D surface. Although the Kinect sensor has attracted the attention of many researchers and home enthusiasts and has already appeared in many applications over the Internet, none of the already presented works can produce full 3-D models of moving objects from multiple Kinect streams in real-time. We present the capturing setup, the methodology for its calibration and the details of the proposed algorithm for real-time fusion of multiple meshes. The presented experimental results verify the effectiveness of the approach with respect to the 3-D reconstruction quality, as well as the achieved frame rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6412815/06359953.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2012.2229264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2012.2229264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6412815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time, Full 3-D Reconstruction of Moving Foreground Objects From Multiple Consumer Depth Cameras","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Three dimensional displays","Cameras","Image reconstruction","Calibration","Rendering (computer graphics)","Surface reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image colour analysis","image fusion","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image registration","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full 3D reconstruction","moving foreground object","consumer depth camera","immersive reality","multiple-Kinect capturing system","RGB-Depth stream","red-green-blue","textured mesh","coarse-to-fine registration algorithm","Kinect sensor","mesh fusion","frame rate","reconstruction quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D reconstruction","CUDA","Kinect sensor","mesh zippering","real-time","tele-immersive applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time, Full 3-D Reconstruction of Moving Foreground Objects From Multiple Consumer Depth Cameras","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6359953/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234885","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time, Full 3-D Reconstruction of Moving Foreground Objects From Multiple Consumer Depth Cameras","sourcePdf":"tmm-alexiadis-2229264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23538S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6412815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6412815","articleId":"6359953","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6359955,"authors":[{"name":"Xinpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6412815/6359955/6359955-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinpeng Zhang (M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in computational mathematics from Jilin University, China, in 1995, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information system from Shanghai University, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Since 2004, he has been with the faculty of the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, where he is currently a Professor.

In this paper, the optimal rule of value modification under a payload-distortion criterion is found by using an iterative procedure, and a practical reversible data hiding scheme is proposed. The secret data, as well as the auxiliary information used for content recovery, are carried by the differences between the original pixel-values and the corresponding values estimated from the neighbors. Here, the estimation errors are modified according to the optimal value transfer rule. Also, the host image is divided into a number of pixel subsets and the auxiliary information of a subset is always embedded into the estimation errors in the next subset. A receiver can successfully extract the embedded secret data and recover the original content in the subsets with an inverse order. This way, a good reversible data hiding performance is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible Data Hiding With Optimal Value Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2012.2229262","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6412815/06359955.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2012.2229262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6412815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reversible Data Hiding With Optimal Value Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6359955/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234887","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible Data Hiding With Optimal Value Transfer","sourcePdf":"tmm-zhang-2229262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058417S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6412815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6412815","articleId":"6359955","onlineDate":"21 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6359996,"authors":[{"name":"O.

To keep increasing the density, FPGA manufacturers design their FPGAs in the most advanced technologies. The design of an FPGA requires the use of memory cells which store the configuration defining the functionality of the FPGA. Advanced memory cells are facing today a number of issues that can be solved by new memory technologies. One of them is the magnetic memory: MRAM [1]. MRAM combines the non volatility of Flash memory, the endurance of SRAM and reliability against radiations induced errors, making a good candidate for replacing today's memory cells in several applications. This paper describes a new radiation hardened FPGA architecture based on MRAM intended for space applications. It combines MRAM and DRAM memories to take advantage of both assets. This new architecture lowers power consumption while increasing density and reliability to soft errors.","publicationTitle":"2012 International Semiconductor Conference Dresden-Grenoble (ISCDG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Semiconductor Conference Dresden-Grenoble (ISCDG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341168/6359978/06359996.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation hardened LUT for MRAM-based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ISCDG.2012.6359996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6359978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCDG.2012.6359996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6359996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6359996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Radiation hardened LUT for MRAM-based FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148811","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6359996/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation hardened LUT for MRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"18AGoncalves.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094177S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341168","isNumber":"6359978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341168","xplore-issue":"6359978","articleId":"6359996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
