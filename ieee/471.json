This paper presents an effective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Localization Scheme using the Radio Signal Strength (RSS) ranging technique. Modified from the iterative multilateration algorithm, our scheme is unique in adopting the location data of remote anchors provided by the closest neighbor anchors of an unknown node to estimate the unknown nodepsilas position and using the PSO algorithm to further reduce error accumulation. The new scheme meanwhile takes in a modified DV-distance approach to raise the success ratios of locating unknown nodes. Compared with related schemes, our scheme is shown through simulations to perform constantly better in increasing localization success ratios and decreasing location errors -- at reduced cost.","doi":"10.1109/PDCAT.2008.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4710941","startPage":"187","endPage":"194","pdfPath":"/iel5/4710940/4710941/04710980.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Ninth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Ninth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDCAT.2008.73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective PSO-Based Node Localization Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Position measurement","Iterative algorithms","Costs","Hardware","Electric variables measurement","Particle swarm optimization","Time measurement","Distributed computing","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance measurement","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO-based node localization scheme","wireless sensor networks","position estimation","particle swarm optimization","radio signal strength ranging technique","iterative multilateration algorithm","error accumulation","DV- distance approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","node localization schemes","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","ranging techniques","Radio Signal Strength (RSS)","anchor nodes","simulations and performance evaluation","localization success ratios","location errors."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Effective PSO-Based Node Localization Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4710980/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4710980/","accessionNumber":"10424293","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective PSO-Based Node Localization Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dunedin, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"3443a187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057782S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4710940","isNumber":"4710941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4710940","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4710941","articleId":"4710980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4711014,"authors":[{"name":"Go Shingu","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Go","lastName":"Shingu","id":"37658522100"},{"name":"Kenichi Takizawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37264999600"},{"name":"Tetushi Ikegami","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetushi","lastName":"Ikegami","id":"37652444600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3443-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"4711014","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":595},"abstract":"Recently, UWB (ultra wide band) signal that has frequency bandwidth of 500 MHz or more is considered to be using high precision radar because of a very high resolution.

This paper presents the design of two decimal floating-point multipliers: one whose partial product accumulation strategy employs decimal carry-save addition and one that employs binary carry-save addition. The multiplier based on decimal carry-save addition favors a nonpipelined iterative implementation. The multiplier utilizing binary carry-save addition allows for an efficient pipelined implementation when latency and throughput are considered more important than area. Both designs comply with specifications for decimal multiplication given in the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754-2008). The multipliers extend previously published decimal fixed-point multipliers by adding several features, including exponent generation, sticky bit generation, shifting of the intermediate product, rounding, and exception detection and handling. Novel features of the multipliers include support for decimal floating-point numbers, on-the-fly generation of the sticky bit in the iterative design, early estimation of the shift amount, and efficient decimal rounding.

In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing network lifetime through balancing energy consumption for uniformly deployed data-gathering sensor networks. We formulate the energy consumption balancing problem as an optimal transmitting data distribution problem by combining the ideas of corona-based network division and mixed-routing strategy together with data aggregation. We first propose a localized zone-based routing scheme that guarantees balanced energy consumption among nodes within each corona. We then design an offline centralized algorithm with time complexity O(n) (n is the number of coronas) to solve the transmitting data distribution problem aimed at balancing energy consumption among nodes in different coronas. The approach for computing the optimal number of coronas in terms of maximizing network lifetime is also presented. Based on the mathematical model, an energy-balanced data gathering (EBDG) protocol is designed and the solution for extending EBDG to large-scale data-gathering sensor networks is also presented.

Numerous nonlinear extensions of pattern recognition techniques have been proposed so far based on the so-called kernel trick. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we derive an additional kernel tool that is still missing, namely kernel quadratic discriminant (KQD). We discuss different formulations of KQD based on the regularized kernel Mahalanobis distance in both complete and class-related subspaces. Secondly, we propose suitable extensions of kernel linear and quadratic discriminants to indefinite kernels. We provide classifiers that are applicable to kernels defined by any symmetric similarity measure. This is important in practice because problem-suited proximity measures often violate the requirement of positive definiteness. As in the traditional case, KQD can be advantageous for data with unequal class spreads in the kernel-induced spaces, which cannot be well separated by a linear discriminant. We illustrate this on artificial and real data for both positive definite and indefinite kernels.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4816105/04711053.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel Discriminant Analysis for Positive Definite and Indefinite Kernels","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Kernel Discriminant Analysis for Positive Definite and Indefinite Kernels","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10575234","pubMedId":"19372607","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4711053/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel Discriminant Analysis for Positive Definite and Indefinite Kernels","sourcePdf":"ttp2009061017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100438S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4816105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4816105","articleId":"4711053","onlineDate":"12 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4711055,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Alzate","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering ESATSCD-SISTA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5370684/4711055/4711055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos A.

This eigenvalue problem corresponds to the dual solution of a primal optimization problem formulated in a high-dimensional feature space. A model selection criterion called the balanced line fit (BLF) is also proposed. This criterion is based on the out-of-sample extension and exploits the structure of the eigenvectors and the corresponding projections when the clusters are well formed. The BLF criterion can be used to obtain clustering parameters in a learning framework.

It was found that ratio and phase errors are affected by the phase angle between the harmonic and the fundamental and the harmonic amplitude. The effects of conductor location in the current transformer's window and of the air-gap width were also investigated.

The sensor was designed such that it can sense low forces which could be comparable to those produced by pulsating delicate arteries, yet can withstand high forces comparable to grasping forces. The influence of some hidden anatomical features, such as lumps, voids, and arteries, on the stress distribution at the grasping surface was studied. In this paper, the capability of the sensor to determine and locate any point load was also investigated.

While there are considerable research efforts to characterize the key features of the K-means clustering algorithm, further investigation is needed to understand how data distributions can have impact on the performance of K-means clustering. To that end, in this paper, we provide a formal and organized study of the effect of skewed data distributions on K-means clustering. Along this line, we first formally illustrate that K-means tends to produce clusters of relatively uniform size, even if input data have varied ldquotruerdquo cluster sizes. In addition, we show that some clustering validation measures, such as the entropy measure, may not capture this uniform effect and provide misleading information on the clustering performance. Viewed in this light, we provide the coefficient of variation (CV) as a necessary criterion to validate the clustering results. Our findings reveal that K-means tends to produce clusters in which the variations of cluster sizes, as measured by CV, are in a range of about 0.3-1.0. Specifically, for data sets with large variation in ldquotruerdquo cluster sizes (e.g., CV > 1.0 ), K-means reduces variation in resultant cluster sizes to less than 1.0. In contrast, for data sets with small variation in ldquotruerdquo cluster sizes (e.g., CV < 0.3), K-means increases variation in resultant cluster sizes to greater than 0.3. In other words, for the earlier two cases, K-means produces the clustering results which are away from the ldquotruerdquo cluster distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2004559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04711107.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2004559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-Means Clustering Versus Validation Measures: A Data-Distribution Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"K-Means Clustering Versus Validation Measures: A Data-Distribution Perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711107/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10518706","pubMedId":"19095536","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711107/","volume":"39","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-Means Clustering Versus Validation Measures: A Data-Distribution Perspective","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-xiong-2004559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157555S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4711107","onlineDate":"12 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4711109,"authors":[{"name":"Gui Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronics Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4939375/4711109/4711109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gui Gao received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in remote sensing information processing from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2002, 2004, and 2007, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology.

The correction assumes that the shape of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) varies much more slowly than the reflectance magnitude. The BRDF shape is quantified by two parameters \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n which account primarily for surface scattering and volume (canopy) scattering processes. Assuming a constant shape throughout the year permits an easy inversion of the two parameters that are used for a normalization of the reflectance time series to a standard observation geometry. Using this method, the corrected time series of data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer show much less high frequency variability than the original input data. A refinement of the method accounts for a slow variation of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n, linearly with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) accounting for vegetation dynamics, and produces an even better correction of directional effects and noise reduction in the time series. The nonlinear short-term variations in the reflectances, which are interpreted as ldquonoise,rdquo are strongly reduced, by a factor of two to four. The reduction in noise in the NDVI time series is less, as the index already implicitly corrects for the directional effects. Nevertheless, the noise in the NDVI time series is reduced by typically 30%-40%. Although the main output of processing using the method is the corrected reflectance, estimates of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n are also generated.

We analyze the performance of the proposed system as the control parameters are varied and show that both the channel capacity and the system BER achieved by the proposed CAMCMC selection algorithm are close to the optimal results obtained by the exhaustive search (ES) method. We further demonstrate that this performance can be achieved with less than 1% of the computational complexity of the ES rule and is independent of the antenna-selection criteria, outage rate requirements, antenna array configuration, and channel frequency selectivity. Similar to the existing antenna-selection algorithms, both channel capacity and system BER improvements achieved by the proposed CAMCMC method are reduced as the channel frequency selectivity increases. Therefore, we conclude that, whether it is designed to maximize the channel capacity or minimize the system BER, the CAMCMC-optimization-method-based antenna-selection technique is appropriate for a MIMO-OFDM system with low frequency selectivity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2010943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04711129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2010943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Receive-Antenna-Selection Algorithm for MIMO\u2013OFDM Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Receive-Antenna-Selection Algorithm for MIMO\u2013OFDM Wireless Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712981","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4711129/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Receive-Antenna-Selection Algorithm for MIMO\u2013OFDM Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2010943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071543S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4711129","onlineDate":"12 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4711131,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4711131/4711131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nan Wu received the B.Eng. degree in electronics engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2003 and the M.Sc.

Also, it can be applied to a conventional discrete Fourier transform to calculate phasor quantities of fault currents in a digital protection relay. In the proposed algorithm, the dc decaying magnitude and time constant are estimated exactly by integrating fault currents during one cycle. The dc decaying component is eliminated by subtracting the dc value at each sampling instant.

While providing a general theoretical discussion for this mode-based approach, a practical application example, namely, a compact electronically scanning array module is developed.

In VSF-OFCDM systems, the existence of multicode interference (MCI) resulting from multiple code channels occupying the same bandwidth degrades the performance. A full MMSE receiver is analytically studied in this letter, exploiting correlation properties among transmitted data on different subcarriers to combat the MCI. Furthermore, considering the fact that the fast time-varying fading destroys the orthogonality of the time domain spreading codes and thus introduces time domain MCI, its effect on system performance is evaluated accurately. It is also shown that it is expected to use time domain spreading factor N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n of 8 for a large range of Doppler frequencies, and frequency domain spreading factor as large as possible, especially in high signal to noise ratio.

The transceiver is noncoherent, neither requiring pilots for channel estimation and tracking nor assuming prior channel knowledge on the part of the receiver. Serial concatenation of a binary outer channel code with an inner differential modulation code provides a turbo structure that, along with the channel memory, is exploited for joint iterative channel and data estimation. While prior work on noncoherent communication mainly focuses on PSK alphabets, we consider a moderate to high SNR regime in which amplitude/phase constellations are more efficient. First, the complexity of block noncoherent demodulation is reduced to a level that is comparable to coherent receivers. Then, a tool for choosing the constellation and bit-to-symbol mapping is developed by adapting extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts for noncoherent demodulation. The recommended constellations differ significantly from standard coherent channel constellations, and from prior recommendations for uncoded noncoherent systems. The analysis shows that standard convolutional codes are nearly optimal when paired with differential amplitude/phase modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4711156/04711168.pdf","startPage":"2040","endPage":"2049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.040684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded noncoherent communication with amplitude/phase modulation: from shannon theory to practical architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase modulation","Demodulation","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Radio transceivers","Frequency","Channel estimation","Receivers","Modulation coding","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","binary codes","channel coding","channel estimation","mobile radio","modulation coding","phase shift keying","transceivers","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded noncoherent communication","amplitude-phase modulation","Shannon theory","radio transceiver","frequency nonselective channel","outdoor mobile wireless system","channel estimation","binary outer channel code","differential modulation code","turbo structure","joint iterative channel","data estimation","PSK alphabet","block noncoherent demodulation","extrinsic information transfer chart","coherent channel constellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coded noncoherent communication with amplitude/phase modulation: from shannon theory to practical architectures","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4711168/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10360508","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded noncoherent communication with amplitude/phase modulation: from shannon theory to practical architectures","sourcePdf":"2040-tc0812-jacobsen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027214S","chronDate":"December  2008","isNumber":"4711156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4711168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711169,"authors":[{"name":"Yingquan Wu","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4711156/4711169/4711169-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dr. Yingquan Wu (M'07) was born in the People's Republic of China.

Finally, we propose an attractive design for the corresponding VLSI architecture that is only mildly more complex than popular decoder architectures under the Hamming metric; since the proposed architecture can also be used for decoding under the Hamming metric without extra hardware, one can use the proposed architecture to decode under both distance metrics (Lee and Hamming).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.041227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4711156/04711169.pdf","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.041227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding algorithm and architecture for BCH codes under the Lee Metric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Decoding algorithm and architecture for BCH codes under the Lee Metric","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711169/","publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10360509","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711169/","volume":"56","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding algorithm and architecture for BCH codes under the Lee Metric","sourcePdf":"2050-tc0812-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067334S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4711156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4711156","articleId":"4711169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-31"},{"_id":4711170,"authors":[{"name":"Libero Dinoi","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4711156/4711170/4711170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Libero Dinoi received the M.S.

We first derive a new FER upper bound using the union bound and the PEP upper bound in the fast fading environment. The derived FER upper bound is very accurate, requires only the distance spectrum of the spacetime code, and takes a closed-form expression. Then we propose a distance spectrum computation method of space-time codes in fast fading channels, which exploits the symmetric property of the error state diagram in space-time trellis coded MPSK modulation to reduce the computation complexity. Numerical results illustrate that the derived FER bound is tight enough to estimate the performance of space-time codes in fast fading channels with sufficient accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Fading","Upper bound","Performance analysis","Closed-form solution","Error analysis","Modulation coding","Rayleigh channels","Wireless communication","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time code performance analysis","fast Rayleigh fading channel","distance spectrum computation method","FER upper bound","union bound","PEP upper bound","closed-form expression","symmetric property","error state diagram","space-time trellis coded MPSK modulation","computation complexity","frame error rate","pairwise error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time codes","frame error rate","fast fading","distance spectrum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.020069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4711156/04711174.pdf","startPage":"2105","endPage":"2115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.020069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and distance spectrum of space-time codes in fast rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance and distance spectrum of space-time codes in fast rayleigh fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711174/","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711174/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10360514","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and distance spectrum of space-time codes in fast rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"2105-tc0812-byun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062035S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4711156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4711156","articleId":"4711174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4711175,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Shan","affiliation":["Global Standard Research Team, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4711156/4711175/4711175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng Shan received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

We demonstrate that by combining useful properties of three-level codes, i.e., codes with values of -1, 0, +1, and RAKE receiver, we can introduce a new strategy in which it can result in superior performance when compared to previous results. In particular, following a discussion on three-level codes we can show that RAKE receiver with optimum multiplicative weights achieves a better performance when compared with simple two-level codes. With the help of an example we show various properties of RAKE receiver as well as three-level codes and relate these properties to a number of simple descriptive parameters of the communication media. Simulation results obtained in this paper indicate the precision with which the analytical results have been obtained in modeling the above system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA in the presence of multiple gaussian interferences: RAKE receiver and three-level codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060285","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4711156/04711181.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"UWB spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA in the presence of multiple gaussian interferences: RAKE receiver and three-level codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4711181/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10360521","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB spectrally-encoded spread-time CDMA in the presence of multiple gaussian interferences: RAKE receiver and three-level codes","sourcePdf":"2178-tc0812-mashhadi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080757S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4711156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4711156","articleId":"4711181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711182,"authors":[{"name":"Iordanis Koutsopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications Engineering, University of Thessally, Volos, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4711156/4711182/4711182-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iordanis Koutsopoulos (S '99, M '03) is Lecturer at the Department of Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Thessaly, Greece.

Different users experience different quality in different carriers due to frequency selectivity of users' propagation channels and due to non-co-located user receivers that perceive different interference from neighboring cells across carriers. We study a static instance of the problem, specified by user carrier qualities and rate requirements. Adaptive modulation at the transmitter differentiates carriers for each user. In good quality carriers, the user satisfies per-frame rate requirements with few slots (or equivalently it satisfies its per-slot rate requirements with small occupied time slot portion). We study integral and fractional assignment, where a user is assigned to only one or several carriers. Fractional assignment is formulated as a linear programming problem. For integral assignment, we introduce two classes of iterative heuristics that use carrier reassignment to users and user substitution in carriers respectively and may be viewed as resulting from corresponding optimal fractional assignment algorithms. We use Lagrangian relaxation to obtain performance bounds and show that the two classes of heuristics arise from two relaxations. Our approach identifies efficient feasible solutions and is amenable to distributed implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4711156/04711182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711156","startPage":"2190","endPage":"2199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier assignment algorithms for OFDM-based multi-carrier wireless networks with channel adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carrier assignment algorithms for OFDM-based multi-carrier wireless networks with channel adaptation","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10360522","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711182/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier assignment algorithms for OFDM-based multi-carrier wireless networks with channel adaptation","sourcePdf":"2190-tc0812-koutsopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075116S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4711156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"4711156","articleId":"4711182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4711184,"authors":[{"name":"Frode B\u00f8hagen","affiliation":["Telenor Research and Innovation, Oslo, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4711156/4711184/4711184-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frode B\u00f8hagen was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1978.

Numerous algorithms have been proposed for lossless, near-lossless and lossy compression. The performance evaluation of compression methods is typically done only for artificial CFA data, obtained by sub-sampling full color images according to CFA pattern, without taking into account that CFA data are heavily processed before obtaining full color images. Therefore, some assumptions that are true for reconstructed images may not hold for real raw data. Thus, compression efficiency of different methods may vary. In this paper we evaluate the performance of some methods for lossless and near-lossless compression for real raw Bayer pattern CFA data obtained from digital cameras.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711192/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10362630","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lossless and near lossless compression of real color filter array data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless and near lossless compression of real color filter array data","sourcePdf":"p1492-bazhyna.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085365S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4711200,"authors":[{"name":"Junling Zhang","affiliation":["Philips Research Asia Shanghai (PRAS), Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711200/4711200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junling Zhang received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in 1999 and 2003 respectively.

DRM systems use coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM) modulation with a multilevel coding scheme to get high resistance to the multipath padding and interference. The bandwidth of a DRM passband signal is less than 20 kHz and the number of carriers used in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is relatively small. For this reason, DRM systems use non-power-of-two Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for OFDM demodulation, such processing gives way to more speed and power consumption in critical paths in DRM receivers.

The most common approaches in estimating timing use correlation by using a given preamble. Thus, the estimation performance is directly dependent on the specific preamble type. The proposed algorithm estimates the timing by using a simple circular shift operation of the given preamble at the receiver. For this reason, the proposed method can be used for any of the OFDM systems regardless of their preamble structures. The simulation results investigated in this paper reveal that the proposed method remarkably increases the estimation performance by more than 5 dB in terms of the mean squared error compared to conventional methods. We also consider the computational complexity of the methods and introduce a simple structure to reduce the computational burden of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing estimation for OFDM systems by using a correlation sequence of preamble","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711208","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711208.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Timing estimation for OFDM systems by using a correlation sequence of preamble","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711208/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing estimation for OFDM systems by using a correlation sequence of preamble","sourcePdf":"p1600-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057547S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711209,"authors":[{"name":"Junu Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711209/4711209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junu Kim received B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 1995 and 2001.

We show that system-wide optimal resource allocation can be obtained by combining our algorithm with a simple two-step decomposition of the system. In some configurations frequent re-allocations of resource are required, so we also present a sub-optimal allocation algorithm which runs in near linear time.

Recently, to enhance the performance of OFDMA systems, MIMO techniques have been investigated, and the OFDMA systems have been extended to MIMO architectures. Although transmit diversity is clearly advantageous on OFDMA uplink system in interactive broadcasting, it may not be possible that practical OFDMA system of wireless interactive broadcasting have more than two antennas due to size, cost, or hardware limitations. Cooperative diversity techniques are proposed to overcome the limitations. Cooperative networks aim to utilize the available terminals as a collection of distributed antennas for the transmission of signals from one end of the network to the other. Therefore, this paper focuses on design and performance evaluation of MIMO-OFDMA uplink system with cooperative diversity for wireless interactive broadcasting. For high-rate and reliable transmission, efficient transmission codes are proposed for two transmission cases (one-sided transmission case and two-sided transmission case). And, we present our investigations of the effects of line-of-sight. In the wireless communication environment, line-of-sight is very important to improve the system performance. Under the condition of utilizing the line-of-sight of cooperative partner, the performance of a terminal without line-of-sight can be improved. Taking into account the effects of utilizing line-of sight of cooperative partner, the BER performance is investigated for a MIMO-OFDMA uplink scenario.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711212.pdf","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative diversity technique for MIMO-OFDM uplink in wireless interactive broadcasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV broadcasting","Digital video broadcasting","MIMO","Satellite broadcasting","Transmitting antennas","Radio broadcasting","Multimedia communication","System performance","Costs","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","interactive systems","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio broadcasting","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity technique","wireless interactive broadcasting","MIMO","transmit diversity","OFDMA uplink system","reliable transmission","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interactive broadcasting","OFDMA","MIMO","cooperative diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative diversity technique for MIMO-OFDM uplink in wireless interactive broadcasting","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711212/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362649","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative diversity technique for MIMO-OFDM uplink in wireless interactive broadcasting","sourcePdf":"p1627-baek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071447S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4711214,"authors":[{"name":"Runfeng Yang","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory (SPL), University of Reading, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711214/4711214-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Runfeng Yang (M'06) was born in Dongguan, China.

ECMA-368 has been chosen as the physical radio platform for many systems including wireless USB (W-USB), Bluetooth 3.0 and wireless HDMI; hence ECMA-368 is an important issue to consumer electronics and the user's experience of these products. To enable the transport of high-rate USB, ECMA-368 offers up to 480 Mb/s instantaneous bit rate to the medium access control (MAC) layer, but depending on radio channel conditions dropped packets unfortunately result in a lower throughput. This paper presents an alternative high data rate modulation scheme that fits within the configuration of the current standard increasing system throughput by achieving 600 Mb/s (reliable to 3.1 meters) thus maintaining the high rate USB throughput even with a moderate level of dropped packets. The modulation system is termed dual circular 32-QAM (DC 32-QAM). The system performance for DC 32-QAM modulation is presented and compared with 16-QAM and DCM.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711214.pdf","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing MB-OFDM throughput with dual circular 32-QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711214/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing MB-OFDM throughput with dual circular 32-QAM","volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362657","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711214/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing MB-OFDM throughput with dual circular 32-QAM","sourcePdf":"p1640-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052662S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711230,"authors":[{"name":"Donghyuk Park","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711230/4711230-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongbyuk Park (M'08) received the B.S. degree from Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea in 2007.

We concatenate a channel detector using a recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code decoder and a message-passing algorithm. The RSC code itself is simple but its performance is inferior to other iterative decoding methods. Therefore, we used channel iteration between the channel detector and the RSC decoder in order to improve performance. We also used a precoding and random interleaver.

A video player may prefetch many frames to give disk an opportunity to go to standby mode, but this may cause playback to be distorted or stopped if timely power mode transitions are not incorporated. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a data prefetching scheme for energy-aware video data retrieval for portable media players (PMP). We formulate the problem when the prefetching is used for variable-bit-rate (VBR) streams to reduce disk energy consumption and then propose a new energy-aware data retrieval scheme that prefetches video data in a just-in-time way so as to increase the period in which disk stays in standby mode while guaranteeing the real-time service. We implemented our scheme in the legacy video player called Mplayer that is typically used for Linux-based consumer devices. Experimental results show that it saves energy as much as 51% compared with conventional schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711231/","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711231/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10362664","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive disk power management for portable media players","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive disk power management for portable media players","sourcePdf":"p1755-go.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083794S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711232,"authors":[{"name":"Siyoung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711232/4711232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siyoung Yang received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

In experiments using benchmark test sequences, the proposed algorithm improves the average PSNR of interpolated frames by up to 5.34 dB compared to the conventional algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711242.pdf","startPage":"1830","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiframe-based bilateral motion estimation with emphasis on stationary caption processing for frame rate up-conversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Interpolation","Liquid crystal displays","Hardware","Information technology","Software algorithms","Smoothing methods","Benchmark testing","PSNR","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","image restoration","image sequences","interpolation","motion compensation","motion estimation","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiframe-based bilateral motion estimation","stationary caption processing","motion compensated frame rate up-conversion algorithm","adaptive motion vector smoothing","block artifacts removal","object blurring reduction","benchmark test sequences","frame interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion estimation","motion compensated interpolation","frame rate up-conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiframe-based bilateral motion estimation with emphasis on stationary caption processing for frame rate up-conversion","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711242/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362669","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiframe-based bilateral motion estimation with emphasis on stationary caption processing for frame rate up-conversion","sourcePdf":"p1830-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043407S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4711243,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Woo Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711243/4711243-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Woo Han received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005, He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering.

Due to the constant output bit-rate and the low computational complexity, the proposed method is suitable for the hardware implementation in LCD overdrive. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher compression ratio as well as better visual quality as compared with the conventional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711243.pdf","startPage":"1839","endPage":"1845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector quantizer based block truncation coding for color image compression in LCD overdrive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Color","Liquid crystal displays","Delay","Hardware","Liquid crystal devices","Buffer storage","Computational complexity","Vector quantization","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","image coding","image colour analysis","liquid crystal displays","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantizer","block truncation coding","color image compression","LCD overdrive","liquid-crystal display","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Liquid-crystal display (LCD)","overdrive technique","color image compression","color image compression (BTC)","vector quantization","human vision system (HVS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Vector quantizer based block truncation coding for color image compression in LCD overdrive","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711243/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362692","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector quantizer based block truncation coding for color image compression in LCD overdrive","sourcePdf":"p1839-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06584S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711255,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Celebi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image and Signal processing (KULIS), Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711255/4711255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anil \u00c7elebi (S'OO) was born in Ordu, Turkey.

The proposed hardware architecture has significantly low hardware complexity and therefore very low power consumption. It can process 720p video frames at 30 fps in a pipelined fashion together with the integer ME hardware. Therefore, it can be used in real-time low power video coding systems required by many mobile consumer electronics devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711255.pdf","startPage":"1928","endPage":"1937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An all binary sub-pixel motion estimation approach and its hardware architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Hardware","Computer architecture","Video coding","Computational complexity","Energy consumption","Consumer electronics","Video compression","Transform coding","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer architecture","consumer electronics","image resolution","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sub-pixel motion estimation approach","video coding system","hardware architecture","computational complexity","hardware complexity","mobile consumer electronics devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","One-bit transform","Sub-pixel motion estimation","Source pixel based linear arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"An all binary sub-pixel motion estimation approach and its hardware architecture","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711255/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","accessionNumber":"10362676","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all binary sub-pixel motion estimation approach and its hardware architecture","sourcePdf":"p1928-celebi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088393S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711260,"authors":[{"name":"S.

More often 3D video quality is measured using rigorous and time-consuming subjective evaluation test campaigns. This is due to the fact that 3D video quality can be described as a combination of several perceptual attributes such as overall image quality, perceived depth, presence, naturalness and eye strain, etc. Hence this paper investigates the relationship between subjective quality measures and several objective quality measures like PSNR, SSIM, and VQM for 3D video content. The 3D video content captured using both stereo camera pair (two cameras for left and right views) and colour-and-depth special range cameras are considered in this study. The results show that, VQM quality measures of individual left and right views (rendered left and right views for colour-and-depth sequences) can be effectively used in predicting the overall image quality and statistical measures like PSNR and SSIM of left and right views illustrate good correlations with depth perception of 3D video.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2008.4711260","startPage":"1969","endPage":"1976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4711185/04711260.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2008.4711260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality analysis for 3D video using 2D video quality models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Video compression","Testing","PSNR","Cameras","Three dimensional displays","Humans","Rendering (computer graphics)","Space technology","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality analysis","3D video","2D video quality models","image quality","3D video content"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D video","2D video","VQM","PSNR","SSIM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2008","displayDocTitle":"Quality analysis for 3D video using 2D video quality models","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4711260/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10362680","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality analysis for 3D video using 2D video quality models","sourcePdf":"p1969-yasakethu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056443S","chronDate":"November  2008","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"4711185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"4711185","articleId":"4711260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711272,"authors":[{"name":"Sungchan Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4711185/4711272/4711272-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungchan Oh received BS degree and the MS in electronic engineering from the Sogang university, Korea, in 2006 and 2008.

One key observation for such concatenated coding systems is that the overall error correction capability can be improved by exploiting the iteration-by-iteration bit error number oscillation behavior in case of inner LDPC code decoding failures. Moreover, assisted by field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based simulation platforms, empirical error-correcting performance analysis can reach a very low sector error rate (e.g., 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>\n and below), which is almost infeasible for LDPC-only coding systems. Finally, concatenated coding can further reduce the silicon cost. By implementing a high-speed FPGA-based perpendicular recording read channel simulator, we investigate a 4 kB rate-15/16 concatenated coding system with a 512-byte rate-19/20 inner LDPC code and an outer 4 kB BCH code.

Uncorrelated features are desirable in recognition tasks since they contain minimum redundancy and ensure independence of features. The UMLDA aims to extract uncorrelated discriminative features directly from tensorial data through solving a tensor-to-vector projection. The solution consists of sequential iterative processes based on the alternating projection method, and an adaptive regularization procedure is incorporated to enhance the performance in the small sample size (SSS) scenario. A simple nearest-neighbor classifier is employed for classification. Furthermore, exploiting the complementary information from differently initialized and regularized UMLDA recognizers, an aggregation scheme is adopted to combine them at the matching score level, resulting in enhanced generalization performance while alleviating the regularization parameter selection problem. The UMLDA-based recognition algorithm is then empirically shown on face and gait recognition tasks to outperform four multilinear subspace solutions (MPCA, DATER, GTDA, TR1DA) and four linear subspace solutions (Bayesian, LDA, ULDA, R-JD-LDA).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Object recognition","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Video sequences","Strontium","Pattern recognition","Multidimensional systems","Data mining","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","iterative methods","object recognition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncorrelated multilinear discriminant analysis","tensor object recognition","multidimensional objects recognition","tensorial data","sequential iterative processes","alternating projection method","adaptive regularization procedure","small sample size scenario","nearest-neighbor classifier","aggregation scheme","matching score level","gait recognition","multilinear subspace solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","face recognition","feature extraction","fusion","gait recognition","multilinear discriminant analysis","regularization","tensor objects"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Bayes Theorem","Databases, Factual","Discriminant Analysis","Face","Gait","Humans","Linear Models","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711317","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2004625","startPage":"103","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4740185/04711317.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2004625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711317/","displayDocTitle":"Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis With Regularization and Aggregation for Tensor Object Recognition","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","volume":"20","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10370353","pubMedId":"19095532","htmlLink":"/document/4711317/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis With Regularization and Aggregation for Tensor Object Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnn-lu-2004625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135569S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4740185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4740185","articleId":"4711317","onlineDate":"12 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4711322,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A novel DPS aiming to combine multiple functionalities on the imaging plane has been designed and tested: The on pixel intelligent CMOS (OPIC) sensor was manufactured in a 0.25 mum logic process with 5 metal layers, and 8 mum epitaxial layers. The sensor comprises three 2 x 2 mm test arrays of 30 mum pixels. Two of the test arrays are named \"advanced\" and include two 8-bit DRAM cells, one 8-bit ROM cell, and one 1-bit DRAM cell per pixel. The 8-bit DRAM cells can record both ADC and \"time-to-threshold\" data, while the ROM hard codes the pixel address within the array. The 1-bit DRAM acts as a \"hit flag\" enabling automatic sparsification of the image data based on an external threshold. Results of the device simulation, design and electro-optical testing are presented. The OPIC sensor is shown to have ~50 e-read noise, 105 ke- full well capacity, 10% fill factor, and a measured power consumption of 230 mW when operated at 1000 fps. A 79% reduction in frame size is achieved when imaging a point-like object in sparse mode. Capacitive coupling from digital signal lines was observed in certain modes of operation of the sensor. An alternative coding scheme was devised to quantify this and the effect was found to be most evident at ADC units of less than 2.5 mV. A number of applications are proposed for the functionality available on OPIC. The test structure is demonstrated in a high-speed tracking application and shown to have a 100 ns resolution. This device holds promise for tracking applications where a high position and time accuracy is required.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2008.2008407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4711318/04711322.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2008.2008407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel ADC, Timestamp, and Sparse Readout","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711322/","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel ADC, Timestamp, and Sparse Readout","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10360370","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711322/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Image Sensor With In-Pixel ADC, Timestamp, and Sparse Readout","sourcePdf":"jsen-jcrooks-2008407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087573S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4711318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4711318","articleId":"4711322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4711323,"authors":[{"name":"David J. van den Heever","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa"],"bio":{"p":["David J. van den Heever received the B.Eng. and M.Sc.Eng. degrees in mechatronic engineering from Stellenbosch University, Western Cape, South Africa.

The tactile sensing array can be seen as a coordinated system of touch sensors. The low spatial resolution measured with the FSRs compared to other force or pressure sensors required the use of a super-resolution algorithm. Super-resolution algorithms are often used in digital image processing to enhance the resolution of images. Multiple images taken from slightly different orientations are superimposed in such a way that a single higher-resolution image is obtained.

The dimension reduction is done as a linear transformation (matrix filter). The matrix filter is designed adaptively such that the signal power within a certain sector is preserved while the out-of-sector power is maximally rejected. The columns of the beamspace matrix are designed sequentially, one column at a time. This sequential implementation is carried out by imposing orthogonality constraints between beamspace matrix columns. Hence, the white noise property at the output of the beamspace preprocessor is preserved. The latter is important for subsequent data processing. The proposed algorithm is computationally less expensive as compared to the existing data-adaptive beamspace design techniques. Simulation results validate the robustness of the developed algorithm, and they show its effectiveness and superiority to the existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2008","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10360590","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711340/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Adaptive Dimension Reduction Technique With Application to Array Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Adaptive Dimension Reduction Technique With Application to Array Processing","sourcePdf":"lsp-svorobyov-2008482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086114S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4711334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4711334","articleId":"4711340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4711341,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir R.

Then, for a preselected spatial-domain down-sampling method, we formulate an optimization problem for finding an LTDS to approximate the given spatial-domain down-sampling method for a trade-off between the visual quality and the complexity. By modeling LTDS as a multiple layer network, a so-called structural learning with forgetting algorithm is then applied to solve the optimization problem. The proposed framework has been applied to discover optimal LTDSs corresponding to a spatial down-sampling method with Butterworth low-pass filtering and bicubic interpolation.

To that end, response surfaces of all sensors are generated via a thermo-dynamical simulation model for the engine as a function of variations of flow and efficiency of the modules of interest. An exponential rate of change for flow and efficiency loss was imposed for each data set, starting at a randomly chosen initial deterioration set point. The rate of change of the flow and efficiency denotes an otherwise unspecified fault with increasingly worsening effect. The rates of change of the faults were constrained to an upper threshold but were otherwise chosen randomly. Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the failure criterion is reached when health index reaches zero. Output of the model was the time series (cycles) of sensed measurements typically available from aircraft gas turbine engines. The data generated were used as challenge data for the prognostics and health management (PHM) data competition at PHMpsila08.","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2008.4711414","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694772/4711413/04711414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2008.4711414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711414/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10423504","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122449S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694772","isNumber":"4711413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694772","citationCount":"363","xplore-issue":"4711413","articleId":"4711414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4711417,"authors":[{"name":"Nishad Patil","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nishad","lastName":"Patil","id":"37645168000"},{"name":"Diganta Das","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Diganta","lastName":"Das","id":"37330954200"},{"name":"Kai Goebel","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37268804600"},{"name":"Michael Pecht","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pecht","id":"37274594800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1935-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1936-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4711417","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1700},"abstract":"Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) are used in applications such as the switching of automobile and train traction motors, high voltage power supplies, and in aerospace applications such as switch mode power supplies (SMPS) to regulate DC voltage. The failure of these switches can reduce the efficiency of the system or lead to system failure. By identifying failure precursor parameters in IGBTs and monitoring them, a prognostics methodology can be developed to predict and avert failures. In this study, IGBTs aged by thermal-electrical stresses were evaluated in comparison with new components to determine the electrical parameters that change with stressing. Three potential precursor parameter candidates, threshold voltage, transconductance, and collector-emitter (ON) voltage, were evaluated by comparing aged and new IGBTs under a temperature range of 25-200degC. The trends in the three electrical parameters with temperature were correlated to device degradation. A methodology is presented for validating these precursor parameters for IGBT prognostics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694772/4711413/04711417.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2008.4711417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2008.4711417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of failure precursor parameters for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Switched-mode power supply","Switches","Traction power supplies","Aging","Thermal stresses","Threshold voltage","Automobiles","Traction motors","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","insulated gate bipolar transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure precursor parameters","insulated gate bipolar transistors","train traction motors","automobile switching applications","aerospace applications","switch mode power supplies","prognostics methodology","thermal-electrical stresses","collector-emitter voltage","threshold voltage","transconductance","device degradation","temperature 25 degC to 200 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Failure precursor parameters","IGBTs","prognostics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Identification of failure precursor parameters for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711417/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423507","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of failure precursor parameters for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053578S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694772","isNumber":"4711413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694772","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4711413","articleId":"4711417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711421,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37654794000"},{"name":"Jianbo Yu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China","University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Jianbo Yu","id":"37654986100"},{"name":"David Siegel","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Siegel","id":"38180728600"},{"name":"Jay Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656542300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1935-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1936-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4711421","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":186,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":5388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Life estimation","Systems engineering and theory","Prognostics and health management","Life testing","Libraries","Degradation","Pattern matching","Mechanical engineering","Data engineering","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","remaining life assessment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["similarity-based prognostics approach","remaining useful life estimation","engineered systems","run-to-failure data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Health management","Performance assessment","Prognostics","Remaining useful life"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a similarity-based approach for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in prognostics.

They combine advantages of the rigors of Bayesian estimation to nonlinear prediction while also providing uncertainty estimates with a given solution. Within the context of particle filters, this paper introduces several novel methods for uncertainty representations and uncertainty management. The prediction uncertainty is modeled via a rescaled Epanechnikov kernel and is assisted with resampling techniques and regularization algorithms. Uncertainty management is accomplished through parametric adjustments in a feedback correction loop of the state model and its noise distributions. The correction loop provides the mechanism to incorporate information that can improve solution accuracy and reduce uncertainty bounds. In addition, this approach results in reduction in computational burden. The scheme is illustrated with real vibration feature data from a fatigue-driven fault in a critical aircraft component.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711433/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423523","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Advances in uncertainty representation and management for particle filtering applied to prognostics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in uncertainty representation and management for particle filtering applied to prognostics","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044379S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694772","isNumber":"4711413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694772","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4711413","articleId":"4711433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711436,"authors":[{"name":"Abhinav Saxena","affiliation":["Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37287158500"},{"name":"Jose Celaya","affiliation":["Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Celaya","id":"37409494900"},{"name":"Edward Balaban","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Balaban","id":"37295483600"},{"name":"Kai Goebel","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37268804600"},{"name":"Bhaskar Saha","affiliation":["Mission Critical Technologies at NASA Ames Research Center, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhaskar","lastName":"Saha","id":"37409189100"},{"name":"Sankalita Saha","affiliation":["Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sankalita","lastName":"Saha","id":"37289140400"},{"name":"Mark Schwabacher","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Schwabacher","id":"37660222900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1935-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1936-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4711436","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":183,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NASA","Prognostics and health management","Measurement","Conference management","Certification","Performance evaluation","Testing","Space vehicles","Computer science","Mission critical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","maintenance engineering","remaining life assessment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prognostic techniques","condition based maintenance","remaining useful life","health maintenance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prognostics and Health Management","Performance Metrics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711436","abstract":"Prognostics is an emerging concept in condition based maintenance (CBM) of critical systems. Along with developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.","doi":"10.1109/PHM.2008.4711436","startPage":"1","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM.2008.4711436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711413","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4694772/4711413/04711436.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metrics for evaluating performance of prognostic techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711436/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Metrics for evaluating performance of prognostic techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711436/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10423526","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metrics for evaluating performance of prognostic techniques","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08466S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4694772","isNumber":"4711413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4694772","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"4711413","articleId":"4711436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":4711445,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292022100"},{"name":"Chris Sconyers","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Sconyers","id":"37542547300"},{"name":"Carl Byington","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Byington","id":"37268790500"},{"name":"Romano Patrick","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Romano","lastName":"Patrick","id":"37412118700"},{"name":"Marcos Orchard","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenieria El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Orchard","id":"37302374800"},{"name":"George Vachtsevanos","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Vachtsevanos","id":"37268243000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1935-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1936-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4711445","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Robustness","Testing","Systems engineering and theory","Condition monitoring","Bayesian methods","State estimation","Filtering","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aircraft maintenance","Bayes methods","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","image sensors","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","unanticipated faults detection","critical components/subsystems","Bayesian estimation framework","particle filtering","condition indicators","confidence level","test rig"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rolling element bearing","Signal enhancement","Feature extraction","Anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a methodology to detect as early as possible with specified degree of confidence and prescribed false alarm rate an anomaly or novelty (incipient failure) associated with critical components/subsystems of an engineered system that is configured to monitor continuously its health status.

Low-complexity marching tests, which are ideally suited for production testing, are insufficient for debug and diagnostics. On-chip support for multiple memory test algorithms can be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, memory test engineers would like the flexibility to make small changes to the test sequence. Run-time programmability can be provided through the use of programmable finite state machines and/or microcode in the BIST controllers. Since such controllers have higher area requirement, it is difficult to employ multiple controllers and distribute them geographically on the chip. Therefore, the BIST controller can become a routing hot-spot. Existing memory BIST insertion flows operate on a post-synthesis net-list and ignore the constraints that will be posed by the physical design step that will follow. These constraints include routing congestion and interconnect timing. Similarly, the synthesis of the BIST logic must also address area, test application time and test power constraints. In this paper, we formulate the problem of programmable memory BIST synthesis as an optimization problem and describe an implementation. Results show upto 3X improvement in area and wirelength for industrial designs when a layout-aware flow is used as opposed to manual BIST implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2008.77","publicationTitle":"2008 17th Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 17th Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711536/4711537/04711616.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2008.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout-Aware and Programmable Memory BIST Synthesis for Nanoscale System-on-Chip Designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711616/","displayDocTitle":"Layout-Aware and Programmable Memory BIST Synthesis for Nanoscale System-on-Chip Designs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711616/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layout-Aware and Programmable Memory BIST Synthesis for Nanoscale System-on-Chip Designs","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"3396a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0548S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711536","isNumber":"4711537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711536","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4711537","articleId":"4711616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4711625,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Di Carlo","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano Di","lastName":"Carlo","id":"37567987200"},{"name":"Alessandro Savino","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Savino","id":"37547582200"},{"name":"Alberto Scionti","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Scionti","id":"37589696600"},{"name":"Paolo Prinetto","affiliation":["Control and Computer Engineering Department, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Prinetto","id":"37323155800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3396-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"4711625","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parasitic capacitance","Predictive models","Random access memory","CMOS technology","Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS digital integrated circuits","CMOS memory circuits","Digital circuits","SRAM chips","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parasitic capacitance variations","predictive technology model SRAM core-cells","CMOS technology","digital circuits","static random access memories","SRAM memory circuit","size 65 nm","size 32 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM Memories","Core-cell","Dynamic Faults"]}],"abstract":"The continuous improving of CMOS technology allows the realization of digital circuits and in particular static random access memories that, compared with previous technologies, contain an impressive number of transistors.

The concept of error tolerance has been proposed to reverse this trend by developing new test techniques for chips used in many applications, such as audio, video, graphics, games, and error-correcting codes for wireless communication. In such chips, manufacturing defects that induce errors with severities within specified thresholds (determined via analysis of applications) are deemed acceptable. In this paper, we develop an approach to re-design datapath modules to exploit acceptable errors to improve yield.

So our re-designing technique mainly focuses on reducing delay of datapath modules to improve parametric yield. In particular, we propose multiple approaches and apply them to improve yield of a wide range of adder architectures by exploiting error tolerance in these applications. Experiment results show that even for small thresholds on error severity, we can obtain significant improvements in manufacturing yield.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2008.75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2008.75","startPage":"431","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"2008 17th Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 17th Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711536/4711537/04711628.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Re-design Technique for Datapath Modules in Error Tolerant Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711628/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Re-design Technique for Datapath Modules in Error Tolerant Applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10424419","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711628/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Re-design Technique for Datapath Modules in Error Tolerant Applications","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"3396a431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098228S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711536","isNumber":"4711537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711536","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4711537","articleId":"4711628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4711690,"authors":[{"name":"Henrique Oliveira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto superior T\u00e9cnico"],"firstName":"Henrique","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37590689000"},{"name":"Paulo Lobato Correia","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto superior T\u00e9cnico"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Lobato Correia","id":"37087127527"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711690","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying and retrieving distress images from road pavement surveys","abstract":"This paper proposes a system capable of identifying and retrieving distress images from a road pavement survey image database. A database of images acquired during road pavement surface surveys along Portuguese roads is considered. Regions corresponding to cracks are detected over the acquired images, based on a subdivision of the images into a set of non-overlapping windows, which may be classified as containing cracks, or not. Crack detection results, represented by binary images where windows containing crack pixels are set to one, undergo a second classification stage to distinguish several crack types. This classification follows the structure proposed by the Portuguese Distresses Catalog, produced by the national entity in charge of road maintenance. Three crack types are identified at this stage: longitudinal cracks, transversal cracks and miscellaneous cracks. The experimental results, obtained by processing real survey imagery over Portuguese roads, present encouraging results for automating the process of identifying road distresses from images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711690","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711690.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Roads","Image databases","Surface cracks","Pixel","Information retrieval","Humans","Bayesian methods","Feature extraction","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["civil engineering computing","image classification","image retrieval","maintenance engineering","roads","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distress image retrieval","distress image identification","road pavement survey image database","Portuguese roads","crack detection","nonoverlapping windows","binary images","image classification","Portuguese Distresses Catalog","road maintenance","longitudinal cracks","transversal cracks","miscellaneous cracks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["road pavement distresses","crack detection","road distress classification","image analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identifying and retrieving distress images from road pavement surveys","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711690/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711690/","accessionNumber":"10422714","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying and retrieving distress images from road pavement surveys","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076376S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711702,"authors":[{"name":"Ritendra Datta","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ritendra","lastName":"Datta","id":"37630262400"},{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Jia Li","id":"37336343000"},{"name":"James Z.

Additionally, classifiers trained on the new domain alone may suffer from too few positive training samples. Appropriately adapting data/models from an old domain to help classify data in a new domain is an important issue. In this work, we develop a new cross-domain SVM (CDSVM) algorithm for adapting previously learned support vectors from one domain to help classification in another domain. Better precision is obtained with almost no additional computational cost. Also, we give a comprehensive summary and comparative study of the state-of-the-art SVM-based cross-domain learning methods. Evaluation over the latest large-scale TRECVID benchmark data set shows that our CDSVM method can improve mean average precision over 36 concepts by 7.5%. For further performance gain, we also propose an intuitive selection criterion to determine which cross-domain learning method to use for each concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711716/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422740","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cross-domain learning methods for high-level visual concept classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-domain learning methods for high-level visual concept classification","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05277S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711756,"authors":[{"name":"Fernanda Brandi","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernanda","lastName":"Brandi","id":"37586653400"},{"name":"Ricardo de Queiroz","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"de Queiroz","id":"37295015400"},{"name":"Debargha Mukherjee","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Debargha","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37296135000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711756","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Spatial resolution","Decoding","Video coding","Energy resolution","Image quality","Encoding","Strontium","Video compression","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image resolution","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable video coding","video super-resolution","key frames","motion estimation","frame down-sampling","reversed-complexity coding","image enhancement layers","band-pass versions","up-sampling processes","recovering processes","normal resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super-Resolution","Reversed-Complexity Video Coding","Key Frames","Motion Estimation"]}],"abstract":"Many scalable video coding systems use frame down- sampling in order to reduce complexity and to enable enhancement layers.

We are only interested on the decoder side, wherein we carry motion estimation of the down- sampled frames using the key frames as references. When a match is made, the high-frequency components of the key frames (KF) are used to super-resolve the non-key frames (NKF). The motion estimation process is performed using blocks of band-pass versions of the frames, rather than low- pass ones.

Structural similarity (SSIM) is a novel image quality assessment method, and attracts a lot of attentions for its good performance and simple calculation. But it is proposed in pixel domain, a large computation load is introduced when using it to guide image processing algorithm in discrete wavelet transform (DWT) domain. And image processing in DWT domain has been very common. This paper proposes a discrete wavelet transform- based structural similarity (DWT-SSIM) method for image quality assessment. As it highlights human eyes' sensitive frequency bands, the proposed measure has a better correlation with the judgment of human observers than SSIM. Furthermore, the method is easy to implement and embed in DWT domain processing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711770","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711770.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform-based structural similarity for image quality assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711770/","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform-based structural similarity for image quality assessment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422794","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711770/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform-based structural similarity for image quality assessment","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076137S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711771,"authors":[{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Min Zhang","id":"37087149090"},{"name":"Xuanqin Mou","affiliation":["Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Xuanqin Mou","id":"37087266822"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711771","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Psychology","Image quality","PSNR","Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms","Error analysis","Stochastic resonance","Low-frequency noise","Frequency","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["psychovisual image quality metric","multiscale structure similarity","universal full-reference image quality metric","edge structure similarity","spatial position displacement degree","wavelet transform modulus maxima","multiresolution domain","image decomposition","spatial position error statistics","peak signal to noise ratio","stochastic noise","low frequency resolution layer distortion","luminance distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quality assessment (QA)","wavelet","modulus maxima","PSNR"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A psychovisual image Quality Metric based on multi-scale Structure Similarity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711771","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711771","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","abstract":"In this paper, a universal full-reference (FR) image quality metric based on Edge structure similarity (QMESS) is proposed using spatial position displacement degree of wavelet transform modulus maxima between reference image and distorted image in multi-resolution domain. Firstly, we decompose images in wavelet domain. The structure error between reference images and distorted images is computed based on the statistics of spatial position error of local modulus maxima in wavelet domain. At the same time, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is adopted to evaluate the stochastic noise in images. Finally, the low frequency resolution layer distortion is evaluated by means of the mutual information and the luminance distortion. The three components are combined for the whole visual distortion measurement. From the experiment results, the proposed metric is much better than conventional PSNR method and the state-of-the-art SSIM approach in terms of the performance relative to subjective judgment. Comparing to the excellent VIF method, the proposed method performs better in individual distortions and obtains similar results on cross-distortion type.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711771/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711771/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422795","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A psychovisual image Quality Metric based on multi-scale Structure Similarity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A psychovisual image Quality Metric based on multi-scale Structure Similarity","confLoc":"San Diego, CA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053349S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711792,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary College-University of London"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37656141100"},{"name":"Pengwei Hao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary College-University of London"],"firstName":"Pengwei","lastName":"Hao","id":"37266631100"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Information Science, Peking University"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288983200"},{"name":"Mingsong Dou","affiliation":["Center for Information Science, Peking University"],"firstName":"Mingsong","lastName":"Dou","id":"37647235300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711792","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"abstract":"This paper addresses the face hallucination problem of converting thermal infrared face images into photo-realistic ones. It is a challenging task because the two modalities are of dramatical difference, which makes many developed linear models inapplicable. We propose a learning-based framework synthesizing the normal face from the infrared input. Compared to the previous work, we further exploit the local linearity in not only the image spatial domain but also the image manifolds. We have also developed a measurement of the variance between an input and its prediction, thus we can apply the Markov random field model to the predicted normal face to improve the hallucination result. Experimental results show the advantage of our algorithm over the existing methods. Our algorithm can be readily generalized to solve other multi-modal image conversion problems as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711792.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hallucinating faces from thermal infrared images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Infrared imaging","Image converters","Linearity","Markov random fields","Graphical models","Humans","Image recognition","Computer science","Predictive models","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","infrared imaging","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal infrared images","face hallucination","photo-realistic image","image manifolds","multimodal image conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photosynthesis","Infrared imaging","Texture synthesis","Image manifold","Graphical Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hallucinating faces from thermal infrared images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422816","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hallucinating faces from thermal infrared images","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082596S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711839,"authors":[{"name":"Ha T.

For signals having high frequency components, sampling them requires fast analog-to-digital converters (ADC) that are difficult to design without increasing their cost and noise. In this paper, we show that high-resolution samples of any signal, bandlimited or unband limited, can be accurately approximated using multiple sequences of low-resolution samples taken from the same analog signal, probably with fractional delays, using slow ADCs. The approximation is enabled by designing a set of synthesis filters, without any knowledge of the signals to be sampled, to minimize an induced error system in the minimax sense. The approximation performance is guaranteed to be robust even when using estimates of the system parameters (such as antialiasing filters and fractional delays). We present experiments to confirm the potential of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711839/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422863","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust multichannel sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust multichannel sampling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064448S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4711846,"authors":[{"name":"Maria E.

Recent technological advances have lead to image sensors that can combine in real-time several pixels together to form a larger pixel. Larger pixels require shorter exposure times and produce high-frame-rate samples with reduced motion blur. This work proposes ways of configuring such a sensor to maximize the raw information collected from the environment, and methods to process that information and enhance the final output.

The mixture of Gaussian-based appearance similarity model incorporates the appearance variance between different cameras to address changes in varying lighting conditions. To address the problem of limited labeled training data, we propose the use of semi-supervised expectation-maximization algorithm for activity classification. The human activities observed in a simulated camera network with nine cameras and twenty-five nodes are classified into one normal and three anomalous classes. A similar camera network is built and tested in real-life experiments, in which the proposed approach achieves satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711871","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","startPage":"781","endPage":"784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous activity classification in the distributed camera network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous activity classification in the distributed camera network","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711871/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422895","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous activity classification in the distributed camera network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034488S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4711899,"authors":[{"name":"Namrata Vaswani","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Namrata","lastName":"Vaswani","id":"37270922700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711899","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":196,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Filtering","Time measurement","Technological innovation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Humans","Wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filtered compressed sensing","time sequence reconstruction","spatially sparse signals","transform domain","sparsity basis","sparsity pattern","signal transform vector","reduced order Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","Kalman filtering","compressive sampling","sequential MMSE estimation"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of reconstructing time sequences of spatially sparse signals (with unknown and time-varying sparsity patterns) from a limited number of linear \"incoherent\" measurements, in real-time. The signals are sparse in some transform domain referred to as the sparsity basis. For a single spatial signal, the solution is provided by Compressed Sensing (CS). The question that we address is, for a sequence of sparse signals, can we do better than CS, if (a) the sparsity pattern of the signal's transform coefficients' vector changes slowly over time, and (b) a simple prior model on the temporal dynamics of its current non-zero elements is available. The overall idea of our solution is to use CS to estimate the support set of the initial signal's transform vector. At future times, run a reduced order Kalman filter with the currently estimated support and estimate new additions to the support set by applying CS to the Kalman innovations or filtering error (whenever it is \"large\").","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711899","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","startPage":"893","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman filtered Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kalman filtered Compressed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422923","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman filtered Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052562S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4711955,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Ascenso","affiliation":["Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Ascenso","id":"37579968600"},{"name":"Catarina Brites","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico"],"firstName":"Catarina","lastName":"Brites","id":"37295254800"},{"name":"Fernando Pereira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37290921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711955","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711955","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Video coding","Decoding","Merging","Turbo codes","Codecs","Noise level","Signal to noise ratio","Video compression","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error statistics","parity check codes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check code","distributed video coding","turbo codes","coding theory","bit error rate performance","Wyner-Ziv coding paradigm","error correcting codes","parity-check matrix","compression ratio","DCT coefficient bitplane","source correlations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wyner-Ziv video coding","LDPC codes"]}],"abstract":"Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are nowadays one of the hottest topics in coding theory, notably due to their advantages in terms of bit error rate performance and low complexity. In order to exploit the potential of the Wyner-Ziv coding paradigm, practical distributed video coding (DVC) schemes should use powerful error correcting codes with near-capacity performance. In this paper, new ways to design LDPC codes for the DVC paradigm are proposed and studied. The new LDPC solutions rely on merging parity-check nodes, which corresponds to reduce the number of rows in the parity-check matrix. This allows to change gracefully the compression ratio of the source (DCT coefficient bitplane) according to the correlation between the original and the side information. The proposed LDPC codes reach a good performance for a wide range of source correlations and achieve a better RD performance when compared to the popular turbo codes.","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711955.pdf","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711955","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of a novel low-density parity-check code for distributed video coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of a novel low-density parity-check code for distributed video coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711955/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4711955/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422979","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of a novel low-density parity-check code for distributed video coding","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062065S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4711956,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Kamp","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Kamp","id":"37567685200"},{"name":"Michael Evertz","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Evertz","id":"37658208300"},{"name":"Mathias Wien","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Wien","id":"37323602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4711956","dbTime":"53 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":32,"totalDownloads":533},"abstract":"In this paper, a decoder side motion vector derivation scheme for inter frame video coding is proposed. Using a template matching algorithm, motion information is derived at the decoder instead of explicitly coding the information into the bitstream. Based on Lagrangian rate-distortion optimisation, the encoder locally signals whether motion derivation or forward motion coding is used. While our method exploits multiple reference pictures for improved prediction performance and bitrate reduction, only a small template matching search range is required. Derived motion information is reused to improve the performance of predictive motion vector coding in subsequent blocks. An efficient conditional signalling scheme for motion derivation in Skip blocks is employed. The motion vector derivation method has been implemented as an extension to H.264/AVC. Simulation results show that a bitrate reduction of up to 10.4% over H.264/AVC is achieved by the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04711956.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1123","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4711956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoder side motion vector derivation for inter frame video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Video coding","Automatic voltage control","Bit rate","Rate-distortion","Motion compensation","Lagrangian functions","Image sequences","MPEG 4 Standard","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image motion analysis","optimisation","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter frame video coding","decoder side motion vector derivation","template matching","motion information","Lagrangian rate-distortion optimisation","forward motion coding","multiple reference pictures","conditional signalling","skip blocks","H.264/AVC","bitrate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","Template matching","Motion compensation","H.264/AVC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4711956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Decoder side motion vector derivation for inter frame video coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4711956/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10422980","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoder side motion vector derivation for inter frame video coding","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055358S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4711956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4711975,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Zhao","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaonan Zhao","id":"37657040500"},{"name":"Matthew G.

The proposed framework of joint source-channel (JSC) coding is a balanced multiple description coding (MDC) scheme for scan-based wavelet transform video coding. This MDC scheme includes an efficient bit allocation procedure that dispatches the source video redundancy between the different descriptions, depending of the characteristics of the channel. The paper focuses on the joint decoding of two descriptions received at decoder and corrupted by noise. The challenge is to reconstruct a 'central' signal with central distortion as small as possible using the knowledge of the two descriptions. We propose in this paper a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm for the decoding, using the knowledge of the probability density function (pdf) of the different subband descriptions.

This fingerprint can be estimated from multiple images taken by the camera. In this paper, we demonstrate that the same fingerprint can be used for identification of camera brand and model. This is possible due to the fact that fingerprints estimated from images in the TIFF/JPEG format contain local structure due to various in-camera processing that can be detected by extracting a set of numerical features from the fingerprints and classifying them using pattern classification methods. We estimate and classify fingerprints for more than 4500 digital cameras spanning 8 different brands and 17 models.

We propose a new image representation scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) because compressive sensing is capable of reducing computational complexity of an image/video encoder. In our scheme, the encoder first decomposes the input image into two components, i.e., dense and sparse components; then the dense component is encoded by the traditional approach while the sparse component is encoded by a CS technique. To improve the rate distortion performance, we leverage the strong correlation between dense and sparse components. Given the measurements and the prediction of the sparse component, we use projection onto convex set (POCS) to reconstruct the sparse component. Our method considerably reduces the number of random measurements needed and decoding computational complexity, compared to the existing CS methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712012","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image representation by compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image representation by compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712012/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423036","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image representation by compressed sensing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053508S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4712049,"authors":[{"name":"Shahryar Karimi-Ashtiani","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering and Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shahryar","lastName":"Karimi-Ashtiani","id":"38272686000"},{"name":"C.-C.

We first extend the local binary patterns from spatial domain to spatio-temporal domain, and present a new online dynamic texture extraction operator, named spatio-temporal local binary patterns (STLBP). Then we present a novel and effective method for dynamic background modeling and subtraction using STLBP. In the proposed method, each pixel is modeled as a group of STLBP dynamic texture histograms which combine spatial texture and temporal motion information together.

The proposed codec relies on a shape-adaptive wavelet transform and an explicit representation of the locations of major depth edges. Unlike classical wavelet transforms, the shape-adaptive transform generates small wavelet coefficients along depth edges, which greatly reduces the data entropy. The codec also shares the edge information between the depth map and the image to reduce their correlation. The wavelet transform is implemented by shape-adaptive lifting, which enables fast computations and perfect reconstruction. Experimental results on real data confirm the superiority of the proposed codec, with PSNR gains of up to 5.46 dB on the depth map and up to 0.19 dB on the image compared to standard wavelet codecs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712118.pdf","startPage":"1768","endPage":"1771","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint encoding of the depth image based representation using shape-adaptive wavelets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Codecs","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet transforms","Code standards","Discrete cosine transforms","Entropy","Three dimensional TV","Piecewise linear approximation","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","image coding","image representation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint encoding","depth image based representation","shape-adaptive wavelet transform","free-viewpoint 3D-TV","codec","shape-adaptive lifting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-TV","shape-adaptive wavelet transform","lifting","boundary wavelets","edge coding","joint coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint encoding of the depth image based representation using shape-adaptive wavelets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712118/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423140","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint encoding of the depth image based representation using shape-adaptive wavelets","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078567S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712140,"authors":[{"name":"Ghaith M.

A well-known anomaly detector, so called RX algorithm is extended to perform fusion and detection simultaneously at the pixel level by appropriately concatenating the information from the two sensors. This approach is then extended to its nonlinear version using the idea of kernel learning which explicitly exploits the higher order dependencies (nonlinear correlations) between the two sensor data through an appropriate kernel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nonlinear kernel-based joint fusion/detection of anomalies using Hyperspectral and SAR imagery","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712142","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712142.pdf","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A nonlinear kernel-based joint fusion/detection of anomalies using Hyperspectral and SAR imagery","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712142/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423164","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nonlinear kernel-based joint fusion/detection of anomalies using Hyperspectral and SAR imagery","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041622S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712143,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Huck","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel, Centrale Marseille,CNRS,Domaine universitaire de St J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Aix Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Huck","id":"37397184500"},{"name":"Mireille Guillaume","affiliation":["Institut Fresnel, Centrale Marseille,CNRS,Domaine universitaire de St J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Aix Marseille Universit\u00e9, Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Mireille","lastName":"Guillaume","id":"37285088600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712143","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Object detection","Detection algorithms","Independent component analysis","Computer vision","Vectors","Coherence","Image analysis","Layout","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CFAR algorithm","hyperspectral images","anomaly detection algorithm","constant false alarm rate","fastICA generated independent components","adaptive cosine/coherence estimator","reference supervised target detection algorithm","HYDICE dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral","constant false alarm rate (CFAR)","detection","anomaly"]}],"abstract":"paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm for hy- perspectral images.

Recently, TU-based approaches have been widely used in face recognition. This paper proposes a novel face representation and recognition approach based on TU. We make three major contributions: (1) we introduce a novel TU feature, Local Gabor Quarternary Pattern (LGQP), which incorporates both Gabor magnitude and phase information in a single TU code; (2) similarity measure of two TU images is treated as a tracking problem between two images, and we present a novel point-to-point matching (PPM) approach for TU similarity measure; (3) based on an integral histogram technique, the PPM similarity can be computed very rapidly. Experimental results on CMU-PIE and FERET data sets show that our method is able to reach very promising results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712156.pdf","startPage":"1920","endPage":"1923","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching texture units for face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Histograms","Pixel","Image recognition","Phase measurement","Pattern matching","Gabor filters","Artificial intelligence","Computer science","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["master-slave approach","object detection","object matching","fixed camera","mobile camera","vision-based system","feature extraction","image statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Texture Unit","Local Gabor Quarternary Pattern","Point-to-Point Matching","Face Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Matching texture units for face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712156/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423177","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching texture units for face recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064681S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712172,"authors":[{"name":"Hwal-Suk Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hwal-Suk Lee","id":"37292583700"},{"name":"Jik-Han Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jik-Han Jung","id":"37292227100"},{"name":"Dong-Jo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Jo","lastName":"Park","id":"37275454000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712172","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","IEC standards","ISO standards","Computational efficiency","Video coding","Sea measurements","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast optimal block-matching motion estimation","multilevel successive elimination algorithm","granularity successive elimination","H.263/H.264","video coding standards","ISO/IEC MPEG-1/2/4"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Successive elimination","block matching","motion estimation","fast full search","ESEA"]}],"abstract":"The successive elimination technique is used widely in the successive elimination algorithm (SEA), the multilevel successive elimination algorithm (MSEA), and the fine granularity successive elimination (FGSE) for fast optimal block-matching motion estimation.

The method using concentric sampling structures, boosting process, and coarse-to-fine framework, differs from the traditional pattern matching schemes of time-exhausting correlation. The time complexity at searching stage is invariant to the dimension of concerned patterns. The rotation-invariant collection of concentric sub-samples represents as a reliable relaxation process of weak beliefs to efficiently reject the impossible location candidates. The concentric sampling approximation of integral images and the hierarchical scheme enable sifting out the patterns to process with the reduced complexity.

Inspired by the water-filling power allocation strategy, results demonstrate that further improvements over conventional, single-description coding (SDC) are possible if, for low SNRs, stronger sub-channel is boosted at the expense of the weaker channel. For high SNR values, the converse is true. A simple yet effective power allocation strategy whereby the bulk of the transmit power - the highest value considered was nine tenths - was allocated to the stronger channel (weaker channel) for very low (very high) SNRs yielded improvements of up to 4 dB (1 dB) in average MDC PSNR over the nominal - equal power allocation - case. The PSNR gains for low SNR values even exceeded the gains arising from water-filling.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712182","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712182.pdf","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing video quality for multiple-description MIMO transmission through unequal power allocation between eigen-modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712182/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing video quality for multiple-description MIMO transmission through unequal power allocation between eigen-modes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423202","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712182/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing video quality for multiple-description MIMO transmission through unequal power allocation between eigen-modes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095726S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4712186,"authors":[{"name":"Grigorios Tsagkatakis","affiliation":["Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Grigorios","lastName":"Tsagkatakis","id":"37397659900"},{"name":"Michalis Zervakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Michalis","lastName":"Zervakis","id":"37297156400"},{"name":"Andreas Savakis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Savakis","id":"37269213600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712186","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image communication","Parity check codes","Decoding","Image coding","Error correction codes","Wavelet coefficients","Lattices","Vector quantization","Protection","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","correlation methods","decoding","error correction codes","image coding","parity check codes","vector quantisation","visual communication","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image transmission error","low-density parity-check code","multiple description coding framework","error correcting code","wavelet coefficient","lattice vector quantization","correlation method","encoding scheme","joint source-channel decoding scheme","error recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","channel coding","image coding","error correction coding","source coding"]}],"abstract":"The multiple description coding framework is well-suited for the transmission of images in the presence of transmission errors. However, it has been mainly explored for idealized channels, where packets are either received correctly or not at all. In more realistic scenarios, bitstreams are affected by bit-level noise and error correcting codes must be employed. In the proposed scheme, the input image is decomposed into wavelet coefficients that are encoded using lattice vector quantization for the generation of multiple descriptions. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are used for the protection of each stream, while joint decoding exploits the correlation between the multiple descriptions. The proposed joint source-channel decoding scheme can provide robust transmission of images by introducing a controlled amount of redundancy that can be used for error recovery. Results are presented for image transmission over binary symmetric and Gaussian channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description based image transmission with Low Density Parity Check codes","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712186","startPage":"2040","endPage":"2043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712186.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple description based image transmission with Low Density Parity Check codes","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712186/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423206","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple description based image transmission with Low Density Parity Check codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05577S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4712199,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the case of images, a hash can be used to detect whether the data has been modified in an illegitimate way. When the authentication check fails, it might be useful to localize the tampering in the spatial domain. This paper proposes an algorithm based on compressive sensing principles, which solves both the authentication and the localization problems. The encoder produces a hash using a small bit budget by quantizing a limited number of random projections of the authentic image. The decoder uses the hash to estimate the distortion between the original and the received image. In addition, if the attack is sparse, it can be also localized. In order to keep the size of the hash small, encoding/decoding takes advantage of distributed source codes. This paper also investigates experimentally the tradeoff between the rate allocated to the hash and the performance achieved in terms of tampering localization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712199/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423219","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Localization of sparse image tampering via random projections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of sparse image tampering via random projections","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045749S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712205,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Ye","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37065407600"},{"name":"Marta Karczewicz","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Karczewicz","id":"37295137100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712205","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":78,"totalDownloads":2141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bidirectional control","Video coding","IEC standards","ISO standards","Standards development","Entropy coding","Decoding","Electronics packaging","High definition video","Automatic voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","transforms","variable length codes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264 intra coding","directional intra prediction","directional transform","adaptive coefficient scanning","H.264 integer transform","residual coefficient coding","context adaptive variable length coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264","intra coding","intra prediction","block transform","Variable Length Coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel intra coding scheme is proposed.

Block sizes used for compensation can be chosen to achieve a good trade-off between signaling overhead and prediction accuracy. However, motion field boundaries correspond to objects having arbitrary shapes; this limits the accuracy of block-based compensation, even when small block sizes are chosen. In this paper we seek to enable compensation based on arbitrarily-shaped regions, while preserving an essentially block-based compensation architecture. To do so, we propose tools for implicit block-segmentation and predictor selection. Given two candidate block predictors, segmentation is applied to the difference of predictors. Then a weighted sum of predictors in each segment is selected for prediction. Simulation results show improvements in rate-distortion (R-D) performance, as compared to the standard quad tree approach in H.264/AVC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712289.pdf","startPage":"2452","endPage":"2455","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation based on implicit block segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Automatic voltage control","Accuracy","Shape","Video coding","Motion estimation","Image segmentation","Signal processing","Image processing","Video compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","correlation methods","image segmentation","motion compensation","object detection","prediction theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","implicit block segmentation","disparity compensation","correlation method","video frame encoding","arbitrary shape region","predictor selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video coding","motion search","hierarchical quad-tree","H.264/AVC","segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation based on implicit block segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712289/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423309","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation based on implicit block segmentation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06264S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712301,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Wittmann","affiliation":["Panasonic Research and Development Center Germany GmbH, Langen, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Wittmann","id":"37295024400"},{"name":"Thomas Wedi","affiliation":["Panasonic Research and Development Center Germany GmbH, Langen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wedi","id":"37294959400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712301","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":411},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Adaptive filters","Video coding","Filtering","Transform coding","Automatic voltage control","Quantization","Motion estimation","Cameras","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","image resolution","motion compensation","quantisation (signal)","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented tree partitioning","interactive image segmentation","semisupervised image segmentation method","graph structure","tree-based structure","abstract label nodes","minimum spanning tree","dynamic programming","competitive segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Coding","H.264/AVC","Adaptive Filtering","Motion-Compensated Prediction"]}],"abstract":"Motion-compensated prediction using fractional-pel motion vectors followed by transform coding of the resulting prediction error is used in hybrid video coding. In the case of fractional-pel motion, pixels at fractional-pel positions have to be determined by interpolation. For this purpose, fixed interpolation filters are applied in H.264/AVC. By using fixed interpolation filters, time varying effects such as aliasing, quantization errors, errors from inaccurate motion estimation, camera noise, etc cannot be considered accurately. Thus, the coding efficiency of the motion compensated prediction is limited. The concept of adaptive interpolation filtering addresses these effects resulting in an increased coding efficiency. Since a non-separable adaptive filter is used in prior art, it is associated with a significantly increased computational expense at encoder and decoder. In order to reduce the computational expense, a separable adaptive interpolation filtering is proposed in this paper that achieves the same coding efficiency than the non-separable adaptive filter. With this separable interpolation filter, the computational expense of the filtering is reduced by 24% in case of 4times4 motion-compensated blocks, 36% in case of 8times8 motion-compensated blocks, and 42% in case of 16times16 motion-compensated blocks compared to a non-separable filter, whereas the computational expense is measured by the number of calculation operations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separable adaptive interpolation filter for video coding","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712301","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712301.pdf","startPage":"2500","endPage":"2503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Separable adaptive interpolation filter for video coding","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712301/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423321","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separable adaptive interpolation filter for video coding","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051812S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712314,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Many fundamental image analysis problems, including segmentation and classification, are target applications for the 2D- HMMs. As opposed to the i.i.d. assumption of the image observations, the naturally existing spatial correlations can be readily modeled by solving the 2D-HMM decoding problem. However, computational complexity of the 2D-HMM decoding grows exponentially with the image size and is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present a conditional iterative decoding (CID) algorithm for the approximate decoding of 2D-HMMs. We compare the performance of the CID algorithm to the Turbo-HMM (T-HMM) decoding algorithm and show that CID gives promising results. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on modeling spatial deformations of human faces in recognizing people across their different facial expressions.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712314","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712314.pdf","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conditional iterative decoding of Two Dimensional Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712314/","displayDocTitle":"Conditional iterative decoding of Two Dimensional Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423334","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712314/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional iterative decoding of Two Dimensional Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046025S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712319,"authors":[{"name":"Eric C.

Redundancy among cameras is exploited to generate a discrete 3D colored representation of the scene. Two Monte Carlo based schemes adapted to the incoming 3D discrete data are introduced. First, a particle filtering technique is proposed relying on a volume likelihood function taking into account both occupancy and color information. Sparse sampling is presented as an alternative based on a sampling of the surface voxels in order to estimate the centroid of the tracked people. In this case, the likelihood function is based on local neighborhoods computations thus decreasing the computational load of the algorithm. A discrete 3D re-sampling procedure is introduced to drive these samples along time. Multiple targets are tracked by means of multiple filters and interaction among them is modeled through a 3D blocking scheme. Tests over annotated databases yield quantitative results showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in indoor scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Particle tracking","Cameras","Target tracking","Layout","Monte Carlo methods","Information filtering","Information filters","Drives","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image resolution","image sampling","image sequences","Monte Carlo methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering","sparse sampling","multiperson 3D tracking","low resolution sequences","multiple calibrated cameras","discrete 3D colored scene representation","Monte Carlo based schemes","volume likelihood function","discrete 3D resampling procedure","3D blocking scheme","annotated databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-target tracking","particle filtering","3D color processing","multi-camera analysis","human-computer interfaces"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712337","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712337.pdf","startPage":"2644","endPage":"2647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle filtering and sparse sampling for multi-person 3D tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Particle filtering and sparse sampling for multi-person 3D tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712337/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712337/","accessionNumber":"10423357","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle filtering and sparse sampling for multi-person 3D tracking","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069629S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712345,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed encoder offers high compression performances (gains in bitrate of 60% with respect to the previous MPEG-4 technique and of 20 to 40% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches) and is well suited for compressing both geometric and photometric attributes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FAMC: The MPEG-4 standard for Animated Mesh Compression","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712345","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712345.pdf","startPage":"2676","endPage":"2679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FAMC: The MPEG-4 standard for Animated Mesh Compression","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712345/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423365","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAMC: The MPEG-4 standard for Animated Mesh Compression","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060395S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712363,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Stormer","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine-Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Stormer","id":"37295120800"},{"name":"Gerhard Rigoll","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine-Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Rigoll","id":"37270642400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712363","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Facial features","Covariance matrix","Hidden Markov models","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Iterative algorithms","Iterative closest point algorithm","Face detection","Image databases","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","face recognition","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistep alignment scheme","face recognition","range images","facial feature hypotheses extraction","invariant curvature features","PCA-based classification","iterative closest point alignment","discrete pseudo 2dimensional hidden Markov model approach","vector quantized DCTmod2 features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Statistic modeling"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition in range images is a challenging task, especially if the pose of the shown face is unknown.

Haar-like wavelet features have become dominant in face detection because of their tremendous success since Viola and Jones [1] proposed their AdaBoost based detection system. While Haar features' simplicity makes rapid computation possible, its discriminative power is limited. As a consequence, a large training dataset is required to train a classifier. This may hamper its application in scenarios that a large labeled dataset is difficult to obtain. In this work, we address the problem of learning to detect faces from a small set of training examples. In particular, we propose to use co- variance features. Also for better classification performance, linear hyperplane classifier based on Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is proffered. Compared with the decision stump, FDA is more discriminative and therefore fewer weak learners are needed. We show that the detection rate can be significantly improved with covariance features on a small dataset (a few hundred positive examples), compared to Haar features used in current most face detection systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712367","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712367.pdf","startPage":"2764","endPage":"2767","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face detection from few training examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Face detection from few training examples","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423387","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face detection from few training examples","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051703S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4712373,"authors":[{"name":"Jurgen Seiler","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Seiler","id":"37569803900"},{"name":"Andre Kaup","affiliation":["Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Kaup","id":"37285096200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712373","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Motion compensation","Video compression","Signal generators","Prediction methods","Decoding","Video codecs","Signal processing","Automatic voltage control","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatio-temporal prediction","video coding","signal prediction","refinement step","H.264/AVC","video codecs","spatially refined motion compensation","spatial correlations","temporal correlation","side information","H.264/AVC video codec"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatio-Temporal Prediction","Video Coding","Video Communication"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of this contribution is to introduce a new method of signal prediction in video coding. Unlike most existent prediction methods that either use temporal or use spatial correlations to generate the prediction signal, the proposed method uses spatial and temporal correlations at the same time. The spatio-temporal prediction is obtained by first performing motion compensation for a macroblock, followed by a refinement step that pays attention to the correlations between the macroblock and its surroundings. At the decoder, the refinement step can be performed in the same manner, thus no additional side information has to be transmitted. Implementation of the spatial refinement step into the H.264/AVC video codec leads to reduction in data rate of up to nearly 15% and increase in PSNR of up to 0.75 dB, compared to pure motion compensated prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712373","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","startPage":"2788","endPage":"2791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal prediction in video coding by spatially refined motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-temporal prediction in video coding by spatially refined motion compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712373/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423393","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-temporal prediction in video coding by spatially refined motion compensation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053476S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4712389,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Pantoja","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Pantoja","id":"37410828100"},{"name":"Nam Ling","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Nam Ling","id":"37087166451"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712389","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"The need to move data among devices with different capabilities creates a need for transcoding.

Extensive experimental results illustrate the better performance compared to mixture model based on Markov random fields.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712431","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712431.pdf","startPage":"3020","endPage":"3023","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood neural network based on the correlation among neighboring pixels for noisy image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood neural network based on the correlation among neighboring pixels for noisy image segmentation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10423451","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712431/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood neural network based on the correlation among neighboring pixels for noisy image segmentation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079414S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4712454,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Stamm","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Stamm","id":"37605043400"},{"name":"K.J.

This proves to be problematic due to the widespread availability of digital image editing software. As a result, there is a need for the development of reliable techniques for verifying an image's authenticity. In this paper, a blind forensic algorithm is proposed for detecting the use of global contrast enhancement operations to modify digital images. Furthermore, a separate algorithm is proposed to identify the use of histogram equalization, a commonly implemented contrast enhancement operation. Both algorithms perform detection by seeking out unique artifacts introduced into an image's histogram as a result of the particular operation examined. Additionally, results are presented showing the effectiveness of both proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712454.pdf","startPage":"3112","endPage":"3115","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind forensics of contrast enhancement in digital images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forensics","Digital images","Histograms","Pixel","Layout","Colored noise","Application software","Testing","Filters","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image histogram","histogram equalization","image authenticity","digital image editing software","contrast enhancement","blind forensics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia forensics","blind forensics","contrast enhancement","histogram equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind forensics of contrast enhancement in digital images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423474","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind forensics of contrast enhancement in digital images","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074342S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712461,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Yu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Hang Yu","id":"37652604200"},{"name":"Tian-Tsong Ng","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tian-Tsong Ng","id":"37280168800"},{"name":"Qibin Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Qibin Sun","id":"37272159600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1764-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4712461","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"abstract":"Detection of planar surfaces in a generic scene is difficult when the illumination is complex and less intense, and the surfaces have non-uniform colors (e.g., a movie poster). As a result, the specularity, if appears, is superimposed with the surface color pattern, and hence the observation of uniform specularity is no longer sufficient for identifying planar surfaces in a generic scene as it does under a distant point light source. In this paper, we address the problem of planar surface recognition in a single generic-scene image. In particular, we study the problem of recaptured photo recognition as an application in image forensics. We discover that the specularity of a recaptured photo is modulated by the mesostructure of the photo surface, and its spatial distribution can be used for differentiating recaptured photos from the original photos. We validate our findings in real images of generic scenes. Experimental results show that there is a distinguishable feature of natural scene and recaptured images. Given the definition of specular ratio as the percentage of specularity in the overall measured intensity, the distribution of specular ratio image's gradient of natural images is Laplacian-like while that of recaptured images is Rayleigh-like.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4667700/4711669/04712461.pdf","startPage":"3140","endPage":"3143","publicationTitle":"2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4711669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recaptured photo detection using specularity distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Lighting","Forensics","Image recognition","Geometry","Motion pictures","Light sources","Image retrieval","Content based retrieval","Surface texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recaptured photo detection","specularity distribution","planar surface recognition","image forensics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image forensics","recaptured photo detection","dichromatic reflectance model","specularity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Recaptured photo detection using specularity distribution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10423481","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recaptured photo detection using specularity distribution","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11112008-00792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051556S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4667700","isNumber":"4711669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4667700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4711669","articleId":"4712461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712496,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Hyuk Woo","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Dong Hyuk Woo is a PhD student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The proposed sensorless technique is based on the detection of zero crossing points (ZCPs) of three voltage functions that are derived from the filtered terminal voltages nu\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ao</sub>\n and nu\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bo</sub>\n. Six commutation instants are provided that coincide to ZCPs of voltage functions. Hence, there is no need for any 30deg or 90deg phase delay that is prevalent in conventional sensorless methods. Two low-pass filters are used for elimination of high-frequency noises and calculation of average terminal voltages. Also, a direct phase current control method is used to control the phase currents in the four-switch inverter.

The APZP technique triggers the two-step nonlinear control mechanism to speed up the transient response at the beginning of load variations. Before the output voltage is regulated back to its voltage level, the APZP technique merely functions as a linear control method to regulate output voltage in order to ensure the stability of the system. Fast transient response time, low output ripples, and stable transient operation are achieved at the same time by the proposed APZP technique. Experimental results in the UMC 0.18- mum process show that the transient undershoot/overshoot voltage and the recovery time do not exceed 48 mV and 10 mus , respectively. Compared with conventional design without any fast transient technique, the performances of overshoot voltage and recovery time are enhanced by 37.2% and 77.8%. With the APZP technique, the performance of dc--dc converters is improved significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04712528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2003014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","startPage":"2949","endPage":"2963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Pole-Zero Position (APZP) Technique of Regulated Power Supply for Improving SNR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Pole-Zero Position (APZP) Technique of Regulated Power Supply for Improving SNR","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370099","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712528/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Pole-Zero Position (APZP) Technique of Regulated Power Supply for Improving SNR","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2003014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077573S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4712528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712529,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4712529/4712529-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Faa-Jeng Lin (M\u201993\u2013SM\u201999) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., and the Ph.D. degree from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1983, 1985, and 1993, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1993 to 2001, he was an Associate Professor, and then, a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan.

First, the dynamic model of the PMLSM drive system is derived. Next, a perfect control law designed in the sense of feedback linearization is derived. However, in the perfect control law, the exact values of the system parameters, external force disturbance, and friction force are unknown in practical applications. Therefore, an RWNN is proposed to mimic the perfect control law and a robust compensator is proposed to compensate the approximation error. Moreover, the online learning algorithms of the connective weights, translations, and dilations of the RWNN are derived using Lyapunov stability and back-propagation (BP) method. Furthermore, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is adopted in this study to adapt the learning rates of the RWNN to improve the learning capability. Finally, the control performance of the proposed robust RWNN controller with IPSO is verified by some simulated and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370095","htmlLink":"/document/4712529/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network Controller With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Linear Synchronous Motor Drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network Controller With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Linear Synchronous Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"23TPEL05-FLin-2002081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063747S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4712529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712530,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Yang","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4712525/4712530/4712530-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gang Yang was born in Shandong, China, in 1975.

Therefore, different solutions have been examined to compensate these sags to avoid production losses at sensitive loads. Dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) have been proposed to provide higher power quality. Currently, a system wide integration of DVRs is hampered because of their high cost, in particular, due to the expensive DC-link energy storage devices. The cost of these DC-link capacitors remains high because the DVR requires a minimum DC-link voltage to be able to operate and to compensate a sag. As a result, only a small fraction of the energy stored in the DC-link capacitor is used, which makes it impractical for DVRs to compensate relatively long voltage sags. Present control strategies are only able to minimize the distortions at the load or to allow a better utilization of the storage system by minimizing the needed voltage amplitude. To avoid this drawback, an optimized control strategy is presented in this paper, which is able to reduce the needed injection voltage of the DVR and concurrently to mitigate the transient distortions at the load side. In the following paper, a brief introduction of the basic DVR principle will be given. Next, three standard control strategies will be compared and an optimized control strategy is developed in this paper. Finally, experimental results using a medium-voltage 10-kV DVR setup will be shown to verify and prove the functionality of the presented control strategy in both symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage sag conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Control Strategy for a Medium-Voltage DVR\u2014Theoretical Investigations and Experimental Results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002299","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4712525/04712534.pdf","startPage":"2746","endPage":"2754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2002299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Control Strategy for a Medium-Voltage DVR\u2014Theoretical Investigations and Experimental Results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4712534/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10370103","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Control Strategy for a Medium-Voltage DVR\u2014Theoretical Investigations and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"tpel-meyer-2002299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071086S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4712525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"4712525","articleId":"4712534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712573,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Afgani","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Afgani","id":"37680048400"},{"name":"Sinan Sinanovic","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Sinan","lastName":"Sinanovic","id":"38187672900"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2647-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2648-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5315"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5331"}],"articleNumber":"4712573","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Economic forecasting","Neuroscience","Power generation economics","Histograms","RF signals","Radio frequency","Digital communication","Pervasive computing","Finance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","Kullback-Leibler divergence metric","wireless signals","neuroscience","mathematical finance"]}],"abstract":"A method of detecting changes or anomalies in periodic information-carrying signals or any other sets of data using Kullback-Leibler divergence is described.

We use the replica method of statistical physics to compare the large system performance (in terms of transmitted energy vs. uncoded transmission rate) of both the matched filter and the distributed detection schemes. Using a convex quaternary alphabet we find that distributed detection is most advantageous only when the ratio of antennas at the receiver to that at the transmitter is either smaller than 0.5 or between 1 and 1.22.

We define reliability as the probability that a given demand vector is achieved. Each element in the vector is the desired flow rate of an application. We give a detailed simulation study to support our theory, and analyze the effect of the number of channels, radios, and simultaneous flows on the reliability of a CR network.

The objective of this paper is to study the partial discharge (PD) mechanism in a silicone gel, using electrical measurements and fast visualization. Experiments are carried out in a pointplane geometry, using either impulse voltage or ac. Under impulse voltage, the visualization shows that the first discharges recorded in a new sample are due to the initiation and propagation of \"streamers\", with features close to those previously reported in viscous liquids. Under ac, a stable PD regime rapidly establishes: a streamer creates a cavity with a long lifetime, and PDs occur in this cavity during the subsequent ac waves. Since slow streamers develop during long times (some ms), classical PD measurements do not provide an adequate evaluation of the actual discharge magnitude: very small PDs (1 pC) are recorded, whereas large cavities with a total charge in excess of 10 pC are actually present in the gel. When PDs are repeated permanent degradations of the gel rapidly occur, showing the limited self-healing capabilities of silicone gels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4712645/04712654.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2008.4712654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2008.4712654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streamers and partial discharge mechanisms in silicone gel under impulse and AC voltages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Voltage","Visualization","Power electronics","Partial discharge measurement","Electric variables measurement","Geometry","Liquids","Current measurement","Charge measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate bipolar transistors","partial discharge measurement","power bipolar transistors","silicones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge mechanism","silicone gel","AC voltages","power electronics module","electrical measurement","streamer","discharge magnitude","IGBT","insulated gate bipolar transistor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partial discharges, streamers, silicone gel and power electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Streamers and partial discharge mechanisms in silicone gel under impulse and AC voltages","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4712654/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370130","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streamers and partial discharge mechanisms in silicone gel under impulse and AC voltages","sourcePdf":"p1526-do.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058035S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4712645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4712645","articleId":"4712654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712655,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

Two major tasks of PD measurements may be distinguished, (i) PD detection, hence providing evidence and the type of the PD and (ii) the location of the PD. The question \"Where is the PD source?\" is amongst others tremendously important for scheduling and starting maintenance/repair actions cost and time efficiently or to perform a risk analysis. Here the possibility to geometrically localize the flaw, by means of arrival times of acoustic PD signals, gets an extremely interesting option. Precise acoustic arrival times are consequently essential to accurately locate PD in a power transformer. The averaging of acoustic PD signals helps to enhance the acoustic sensitivity. The acoustic detection limit is lowered significantly and the determination of the arrival times is made possible for weaker PD. Supplementary steps, like automatic objective arrival time determination or additional wavelet-based de-noising further improve the overall location accuracy. A new location approach works with pseudo-times and allows for the use of robust direct solvers instead of the previously used iterative algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and location of partial discharges in power transformers using acoustic and electromagnetic signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2008.4712660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4712645/04712660.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2008.4712660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Detection and location of partial discharges in power transformers using acoustic and electromagnetic signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4712660/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and location of partial discharges in power transformers using acoustic and electromagnetic signals","sourcePdf":"p1576-markalous.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092814S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4712645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"4712645","articleId":"4712660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4712664,"authors":[{"name":"Cecilia Forssen","affiliation":["KTH Electrical Engineering, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/4712645/4712664/4712664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cecilia Forss\u00e9n (S'07) was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1977.

A charge consistent model is presented and used to dynamically simulate the sequence of PDs in the cavity. The simulation results show that the properties of the cavity surface, mainly the surface conductivity and the surface emission of electrons, change with the varying applied frequency.

In order to apply this method in existing transformers, it is considered advantageous to design a UHF sensor to be fitted inside the transformer tank. This paper describes the constraints affecting the development of such sensor and the process followed to optimize its design. During this process, different solutions for broadband UHF antennas were analysed. The selection was based on computer simulation and experimental results. Computer simulation was used to evaluate differences in radiation pattern, antenna impedance, gain and effective area. Measurements of the antenna response to different partial discharge sources in oil were performed using an oil dielectric breakdown test set in an electromagnetic shielded laboratory. A group of selected antennas were then tested in a power transformer simulating the broadband signals generated by partial discharges by injecting controlled voltage pulses in the transformer. Finally, a sensor based on a conical monopole antenna structure was built and attached to a specially designed housing to be fitted inside the transformer tank through the drain valve. This final prototype was benchmarked during a high voltage factory test of a power transformer which showed a significant partial discharge activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712667/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370141","publicationDate":"December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712667/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimisation of a sensor for onsite detection of partial discharges in power transformers by the UHF method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimisation of a sensor for onsite detection of partial discharges in power transformers by the UHF method","sourcePdf":"p1634-lopez-roldan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038668S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4712645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4712645","articleId":"4712667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4712670,"authors":[{"name":"T.

By taking into account the error effect on the decision reporting, a general performance analysis of cooperative spectrum sensing is given. The analytical detection results show that the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing is limited by the probability of reporting errors. To deal with this limitation, we propose a transmit diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing method. By regarding multiple CRs as a virtual antenna array, space-time coding and space-frequency coding are applied into CR networks over flat-fading and frequency-selective fading channels, respectively. Moreover, we propose a relay diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing approach to increase the diversity of detection when some CRs are in heavy shadowing. It is then shown that, when combined with algebraic coding, relay diversity can further improve the cooperative spectrum sensing performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing with transmit and relay diversity in cognitive radio networks - [transaction letters]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.060857","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712688.pdf","startPage":"4761","endPage":"4766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.060857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing with transmit and relay diversity in cognitive radio networks - [transaction letters]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712688/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416528","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing with transmit and relay diversity in cognitive radio networks - [transaction letters]","sourcePdf":"4761-tw0812-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052876S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"258","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712693,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00f8ren Skovgaard Christensen","affiliation":["Modem Algorithm Design, Nokia Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark"],"firstName":"S\u00f8ren Skovgaard","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37408014200"},{"name":"Rajiv Agarwal","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Canada","Stanford University"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37298641800"},{"name":"Elisabeth De Carvalho","affiliation":["Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, DK"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"De Carvalho"},{"name":"John M.

We present a first order analysis of the signal-to-noise-and-interference situation in a wireless cellular network, and analyze the impact of cognitive users starting to transmit. Two main conclusions emerge from our study. First, obtaining any substantial benefits from opportunistic spatial spectrum reuse in a frequency-planned network without causing substantial interference is going to be very challenging. Second, the cognitive users need to be more sensitive, by orders of magnitude, than the receivers in the primary system, especially if there is significant shadow fading. This latter problem can be alleviated by having cognitive users cooperate, but only if they are separated far apart so that they experience independent shadowing.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070928","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"4800","endPage":"4806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio in a frequency-planned environment: some basic limits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio in a frequency-planned environment: some basic limits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712694/","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712694/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416534","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio in a frequency-planned environment: some basic limits","sourcePdf":"4800-tw0812-larsson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041296S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4712696,"authors":[{"name":"Sefi Ronen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Sefi","lastName":"Ronen","id":"37658822100"},{"name":"Tolga M.

A goodbit is a bit that is received without error. A low-complexity, near-optimal algorithm to find constellation size and transmit power is presented. Although perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is assumed, fading can cause situations where the system cannot meet user constraints on acceptable performance. The implications of this type of system outage and the consequent trade-off between energy-efficiency and range are discussed. Assuming that the fading process is ergodic, the average energy-efficient spectral efficiency can be computed for various fading distributions of interest. As an application of the techniques developed, we evaluate, by simulation, the average minimum energy-per-goodbit for a Rayleigh fading channel and note that over a short range of distances (1 m to 10 m), it can cost at most 1 dB more than for the corresponding non-fading AWGN channel. We also show that the restriction of using only a square-QAM constellation does not incur a large penalty in cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712700.pdf","startPage":"4837","endPage":"4842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy minimization of a QAM system with fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Energy efficiency","Rayleigh channels","Costs","Frequency","Channel state information","Transmitters","Distributed computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","computational complexity","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM system","constellation size","energy-per-goodbit","Rayleigh fading channel","low-complexity algorithm","near-optimal algorithm","channel state information","energy-efficient spectral efficiency","AWGN channel","square-QAM constellation","energy minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy minimization, quadrature amplitude","modulation, fading channels, automatic repeat request, adaptive","modulation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Energy minimization of a QAM system with fading","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416540","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy minimization of a QAM system with fading","sourcePdf":"4837-tw0812-prabhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049046S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712702,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37291116200"},{"name":"Jing Zhu","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279944100"},{"name":"Qinghua Li","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Li","id":"37291119100"},{"name":"C.

The key challenge is that the cyclic prefix of the interference signal does not line up with that of the intended signal due to the asynchronous transmission in WLAN. Therefore, the orthogonality across the tones of the interference signal is destroyed and the conventional frequency domain minimum mean square error (MMSE) cancelation techniques that employ the interference channel response per tone can not work effectively. To suppress the asynchronous interference, we design an efficient estimator for the spatial covariance matrix of the interference using Cholesky decomposition and low-pass smoothing.

We further propose a design based on the pre-evaluation of the packet error rate performance of practical MIMO systems employing short-length LDPC codes and QAM modulations and with possibly unreliable feedback links. It is demonstrated that with only a few bits of feedback, the resulting quantized power control strategy achieves considerable gain over a system without power control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712704/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416544","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power control in MIMO systems with quantized feedback - [transactions papers]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power control in MIMO systems with quantized feedback - [transactions papers]","sourcePdf":"4859-tw0812-khojastepour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062269S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712706,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Steger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712706/4712706-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christopher Steger received his B.S, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 2001, 2004 and 2008, respectively, all from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX.

For half-duplex nodes with one antenna at the source node and M antennas at the destination node, we show that a novel training system can double the maximum diversity order of the system. The key departure from existing work is that (a) all resources used to obtain channel information at the source and destination are accounted for, and (b) channel estimates at the source and destination are mismatched and noisy. We further derive the full diversity-multiplexing tradeoff which demonstrates a diversity order gain at almost all multiplexing gains due to information at the source, even when that information is based on noisy estimates and subjected to full resource accounting.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","startPage":"4877","endPage":"4885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-input two-way SIMO channel: diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with two-way training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-input two-way SIMO channel: diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with two-way training","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416546","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-input two-way SIMO channel: diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with two-way training","sourcePdf":"4877-tw0812-steger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122631S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712708,"authors":[{"name":"Peifang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peifang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503800"},{"name":"Scott Jordan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Jordan","id":"37273457500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4712708","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","Resource management","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Access control","Telecommunication traffic","Bit rate","Numerical analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","multiuser channels","scheduling","telecommunication congestion control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer dynamic resource allocation","WCDMA data","elastic wireless applications","target connection average throughput","connection access control","rate scheduling layers","connection current channel","wireless channel time diversity","multiuser diversity","utility-based framework","wideband code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connection access control; rate scheduling."]}],"abstract":"We consider resource allocation for elastic wireless applications that measure utility by target connection average throughput and achieved throughput. We construct a framework for connection access control and rate scheduling that supports this class of applications by maximizing long term average utility. We present a decomposition of the problem into connection access control and rate scheduling layers. The connection access control layer considers current commitments and decides whether to admit new sessions. For admitted users, the layer sets a target throughput to be achieved of the lifetime of the session. The rate scheduling layer adjusts the instantaneous rates of each connection on the basis of how well it is achieving each performance goal and on the relative strength of each connectionpsilas current channel. We illustrate how commonly used connection access control and rate scheduling techniques can be applied to design these two layers using an exchange of information regarding future target throughputs and achieved throughputs. Through numerical analysis, we show how wireless channel time diversity and multi-user diversity can be exploited to construct a rate scheduling algorithm that is superior to proportional fairness. Finally, this utility-based framework is compared to a method that does not use utility.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712708.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","startPage":"4896","endPage":"4906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross layer dynamic resource allocation with targeted throughput for WCDMA data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross layer dynamic resource allocation with targeted throughput for WCDMA data","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416548","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712708/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross layer dynamic resource allocation with targeted throughput for WCDMA data","sourcePdf":"4896-tw0812-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066208S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712709,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Coded or precoded OFDM systems are generally employed to overcome the symbol recovery problem in uncoded OFDM systems. We show that PCOFDM systems are a special case of precoded OFDM systems that offer advantageous complexity-performance trade-offs. In particular, PC-OFDM systems introduce frequency diversity by manipulating the OFDM symbols in the time domain so that the computational complexity of the system can be significantly reduced. We discuss the design principles of PC-OFDM transmitter that uses upsampling operation and the spreading codes to introduce frequency diversity. We obtain the spreading code construction criterion for minimum error performance and give examples of spreading codes for PC-OFDM systems. We also describe the design of low-complexity receiver for PC-OFDM systems. In particular, our proposed partial spreading scheme results in a low complexity decoupled detector. The probability of error analysis of the receiver leads us to postulate different design criteria. We investigate different choices for detection algorithms suitable for PC-OFDM receiver and compare their performance through simulations over Rayleigh and IEEE UWB channels.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712709.pdf","startPage":"4907","endPage":"4918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of post-coded OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712709/","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of post-coded OFDM systems","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416549","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712709/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of post-coded OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"4907-tw0812-shah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085482S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712711,"authors":[{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA","NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712711/4712711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Narayan Prasad received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, in 1999.

It is presented in the context of the multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) fading channel with K transmit and N receive antennas. Three cases are considered to illustrate the technique where all the transmitters employ real-valued pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM), or phaseshift keying (PSK), or complex quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In each case, the corresponding per-symbol decision rules are obtained by imposing the modulation constraints on a likelihood function maximization problem. When all transmitters employ PAM, it is shown that the resulting DFD (the PAM-DFD) is equivalent to the decorrelating decision feedback detector (DDFD) when the latter is used on a modified received statistic. Two DFDs are then derived (the PSK-DFDs and the QAMDFDs) for the cases when all transmitters employ PSK and QAM, respectively. To illustrate the performance benefit, we consider the Rayleigh fading channel and derive the exact joint error probability (JEP) of the PAM-DFD and show that the (possibly fractional) diversity order of the JEP is equal to N - K-1/ 2 . This greatly improves on the diversity order of N - K + 1 of the JEP obtained by the D-DFD without exploiting the real modulation constraint. Through simulations, it is shown that the PSK-DFDs and the QAM-DFDs result in significant performance improvements over the D-DFD as well. It is conjectured that one of the PSK-DFD achieves the improved diversity order of N - K-1/ 2 as well and the QAM-DFDs result in an improvement in effective SNR gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712711.pdf","startPage":"4927","endPage":"4937","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimization approach to decision feedback detection under modulation constraints for MIMO fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Feedback","MIMO","Fading","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Design for disassembly","Transmitters","Detectors","Pulse modulation","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","automatic repeat request","decorrelation","error statistics","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","optimisation","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback detection","optimization approach","real-valued pulse-amplitude modulation","phaseshift keying","complex quadrature amplitude modulation","likelihood function maximization problem","decorrelating decision feedback detector","joint error probability","transmit-receive antenna","multiinput multioutput Rayleigh fading channel","MIMO","JEP","QAM","PAM","DDFD","per-symbol decision rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BLAST, constrained optimization, decision feedback,","diversity, fading channels, likelihood function, Space-Division Multiple-Access (SDMA), space-time processing."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"An optimization approach to decision feedback detection under modulation constraints for MIMO fading channels","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712711/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416527","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimization approach to decision feedback detection under modulation constraints for MIMO fading channels","sourcePdf":"4927-tw0812-prasad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119719S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712713,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Ghaderipoor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712713/4712713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Ghaderipoor received his B.Sc. degree in electronics and M.Sc. degree in communications from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

When complete channel state information (CSI) is not available at the transmitter, a common set of beamformers (codebook) is used by both the transmitter and the receiver. For each channel realization, the best beamformer is selected at the receiver and its index is sent back to the transmitter via a limited feedback channel. In this paper, a codebook design method using the genetic algorithm is proposed, which reduces the design complexity and achieves large minimum-distance codebooks. Exploiting the specific structure of these beamformers, an order and bound algorithm is proposed to reduce the beamformer selection complexity at the receiver side. The exact bit error rate (BER) of the optimal beamforming in finite-series expression is used to facilitate the BER analysis of limited feedback beamforming. By employing a geometrical approach, an approximate BER of limited feedback beamforming is derived when the codebook size is relatively large (high resolution analysis). The simulation results show that the approximate BER is comparatively tight even for small size codebooks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design, selection algorithm and performance analysis of limited feedback transmit beamforming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070582","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712713.pdf","startPage":"4948","endPage":"4957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"On the design, selection algorithm and performance analysis of limited feedback transmit beamforming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712713/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10444572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design, selection algorithm and performance analysis of limited feedback transmit beamforming","sourcePdf":"4948-tw0812-ghaderipoor.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096183S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4712714,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712714/4712714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuang Tian received the B.

It is well known that OFDM systems are sensitive to timing synchronization errors. Existing synchronization methods cannot be used directly or do not perform well in ACO-OFDM systems because ACO-OFDM signals are unipolar. Therefore, new synchronization methods using a novel training symbol designed for the characteristics of ACO-OFDM are presented. The sensitivity of the new methods to the phase of the receiver sampling clock is considered and it is shown that if only the lower frequency subcarriers in the training symbol are non zero, the sensitivity can be reduced. Analysis and simulation results show that the new timing synchronization methods are effective in ACO-OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712714.pdf","startPage":"4958","endPage":"4967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel timing synchronization method for ACO-OFDM-based optical wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Wireless communication","Frequency synchronization","Optical receivers","Optical sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","Sampling methods","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","radiocommunication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization method","ACO-OFDM-based optical wireless communication","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","receiver sampling clock","frequency subcarrier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless communications, orthogonal","frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), timing synchronization,","timing metric, ACO-OFDM."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel timing synchronization method for ACO-OFDM-based optical wireless communications","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712714/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416554","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel timing synchronization method for ACO-OFDM-based optical wireless communications","sourcePdf":"4958-tw0812-tian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068979S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712716,"authors":[{"name":"Qiubin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712716/4712716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiubin Gao received B.S.and Ph.D degrees in in control science and engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.

However, it requires perfect channel state information at the transmitter, which necessitates a great amount of feedback. In this paper, we propose a linear precoding scheme for the V-BLAST architecture with an MMSE-SIC receiver. The whole scheme includes the design of an unquantized precoder and its finite rate feedback. The unquantized precoder, consisting of a beamforming matrix and a power allocation matrix, is designed by maximizing the minimum post-detection SINR of the MMSE-SIC receiver. In addition to the optimal precoder, we give a suboptimal solution which is shown to be asymptotically optimal at low SNR. The advantage of this suboptimal solution is that its extension to finite rate feedback is straightforward. Specifically, beamforming vectors are selected sequentially from a predetermined codebook and the indices are fed back. Besides, elements of the power allocation matrix are scalar quantized and fed back. Theoretical analysis reveals that the unquantized beamforming vectors are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, leading to a very natural codebook design criterion - the Grassmannian criterion. Moreover, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to allow for a change in the number of data streams without redesigning the codebook. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712716.pdf","startPage":"4976","endPage":"4986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070803","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070803","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Channel state information","Bit error rate","State feedback","Diversity methods","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel coding","feedback","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","linear codes","precoding","quantisation (signal)","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoding","finite rate feedback design","V-BLAST architecture","transmitter channel state information","MMSE-SIC receiver","minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation","unquantized precoder design","finite rate feedback","beamforming matrix","power allocation matrix","scalar quantization","Grassmannian criterion","Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["V-BLAST, MMSE-SIC, beamforming, power","allocation, finite rate feedback."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linear precoding and finite rate feedback design for V-BLAST architecture","accessionNumber":"10401660","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712716/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear precoding and finite rate feedback design for V-BLAST architecture","sourcePdf":"4976-tw0812-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127425S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4712717,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Lin","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712717/4712717-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Lin (S'07) is currently working toward his Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where he is a Research Assistant in the Broadband Communications Research (BBCR) Group.

Compared with currently existing public key based packet authentication schemes for security and privacy, the communication and computation overhead of TSVC can be significantly reduced due to the short message authentication code (MAC) tag attached in each packet for the packet authentication, by which only a fast hash operation is required to verify each packet. Simulation results demonstrate that TSVC maintains acceptable packet latency with much less packet overhead, while significantly reducing the packet loss ratio compared with that of the existing public key infrastructure (PKI) based schemes, especially when the road traffic is heavy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712717.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070773","startPage":"4987","endPage":"4998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TSVC: timed efficient and secure vehicular communications with privacy preserving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712717/","displayDocTitle":"TSVC: timed efficient and secure vehicular communications with privacy preserving","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712717/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10416556","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TSVC: timed efficient and secure vehicular communications with privacy preserving","sourcePdf":"4987-tw0812-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076253S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712719,"authors":[{"name":"George A.

First, a chi-squared series expansion is adopted to represent the probability density function of a quadratic form in normal RVs and novel series truncation error bounds are derived, which are much tighter compared to already known ones. Secondly, it is theoretically shown that when an orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC) transmission scheme is used, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver under various fading conditions can be expressed as a quadratic form in normal RVs. Capitalizing on these results, a thorough error probability and capacity analysis is presented for the performance of OSTBC systems over Nakagami-q (Hoyt) fading channels. For all error probability and capacity performance criteria considered, simple, closed-form truncation error bounds expressions are derived, which avoid the use of infinite sums and complicated functions. The proposed theoretical analysis is validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712719.pdf","startPage":"5009","endPage":"5019","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratic forms in normal RVs: theory and applications to OSTBC over hoyt fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Quadratic forms in normal RVs: theory and applications to OSTBC over hoyt fading channels","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712719/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416536","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712719/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratic forms in normal RVs: theory and applications to OSTBC over hoyt fading channels","sourcePdf":"5009-tw0812-ropokis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064384S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4712720,"authors":[{"name":"Angel Lozano","affiliation":["Department of Information Theory & Communications, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712720/4712720-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angel Lozano was born in Manresa, Spain, in 1968.

No side information on the state of the channel is assumed at the receiver. Rather, periodic reference signals are postulated in accordance with the functioning of most wireless systems. The analysis relies on a well-established lower bound, generally tight and asymptotically exact at low SNR. In contrast with most previous studies, which relied on block-fading channel models, a continuous-fading model is adopted. This embeds the Doppler spectrum directly in the derived expressions, imbuing them with practical significance.

By adopting a Bayesian approach involving the statistics of the channel estimation errors, we formulate an improved maximum-likelihood (ML) detection metric taking into account the characteristics of the channel estimates. As a first step, we propose a modified iterative detector based on a maximum a posteriori receiver formulation which reduces the impact of channel uncertainty on the decoder performance, by an appropriate use of this metric. The results are compared to those obtained by using a detector based on a mismatched ML metric, which uses the channel estimate as if it was the perfect channel. In a second step, we calculate the information rates achieved by both the improved and mismatched ML detectors, in terms of achievable outage rates. These outage rates are compared to those provided by a theoretical (not practical) decoder defined as the best decoder in the presence of channel estimation errors. Numerical results over both uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels and realistic ultra wideband channels show that the improved detector outperforms the classically-used mismatched approach in terms of bit error rate and achievable outage rates, without any increase in the receiver complexity.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","startPage":"5039","endPage":"5050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved iterative detection and achieved throughputs of OFDM systems under imperfect channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved iterative detection and achieved throughputs of OFDM systems under imperfect channel estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416537","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved iterative detection and achieved throughputs of OFDM systems under imperfect channel estimation","sourcePdf":"5039-tw0812-sadough.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13816S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4712723,"authors":[{"name":"Kareem E.

Recently, it has been shown that estimation of the K-factor can be improved relative to envelope-based detectors through the use of complex (I/Q) channel observations. In this paper, an analysis of the maximum likelihood estimator of the K-factor from I/Q samples is presented, which illustrates the bias of previous estimators. An improved estimator is then proposed, which has superior bias and efficiency for short data records. For mobile applications, a reliable estimator of the Doppler shift of the specular component is incorporated. Simulation results for a range of channel conditions illustrate that the proposed estimator outperforms prior techniques, and provide insight into the record lengths required to achieve a desired estimation accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4712723/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416557","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved estimation of the ricean K-factor from I/Q fading channel samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved estimation of the ricean K-factor from I/Q fading channel samples","sourcePdf":"5051-tw0812-baddour.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055338S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4712724,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew M.

Our results show that frequency selectivity provides higher information rates than flat fading when the fading coefficients are known at the receiver, however, the improvement becomes marginal with increasing number of channel taps (when the overall signal to noise ratio is kept constant). Furthermore, we develop a distributed turbo-coding strategy and several decode-and-forward type detection/decoding schemes to ensure successful cooperative communication where the source and the relay may transmit simultaneously. We show that with suitable coding and iterative decoding, one can approach the approximate information-rate limits closely, and that detection schemes based on MMSE criterion provide a good performance/complexity trade-off.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Rayleigh channels","Frequency division multiaccess","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Protocols","Information rates","System performance","Digital relays","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","Rayleigh channels","trellis codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-selective fading relay channel","ergodic information-rate calculation","channel trellis code","multiaccess channel","broadcast channel","Rayleigh channel","turbo-coding strategy","iterative decoding","minimum mean square error method","MMSE criterion","cooperative communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable information rates, cooperative communication,","frequency-selective fading, relay channels, turbo","codes."]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712725.pdf","startPage":"5072","endPage":"5081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperation over frequency-selective fading relay channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation over frequency-selective fading relay channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712725/","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712725/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10416560","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation over frequency-selective fading relay channels","sourcePdf":"5072-tw0812-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105978S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4712726,"authors":[{"name":"Siyang Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310596000"},{"name":"Feifei Wang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37654469400"},{"name":"Ranran Zhang","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ranran","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652302300"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4712726","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel parametric channel estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

impulse radio based ultrawideband (UWB) communication is a challenge. High sampling rate high resolution digital receiver is usually difficult to implement. Some tradeoffs can be made on the digital receiver, such as limiting amplitude resolution to only one bit, which results in a previously considered monobit receiver. In this paper, we consider the design of finite-resolution digital UWB receivers. We derive the optimal post-quantization processing, and analyze the achievable bit-error rate performance using an approximation of the log-likelihood ratio. Optimal thresholds for 4- and 3-level quantization are obtained. Training-based receiver template estimation is presented. Our work discloses the incremental gain that additional quantization levels offer and the results provide useful guidelines for designing impulse radio UWB digital receivers.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712729.pdf","startPage":"5108","endPage":"5117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-resolution digital receiver design for impulse radio ultra-wideband communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712729/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-resolution digital receiver design for impulse radio ultra-wideband communication","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10428828","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4712729/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-resolution digital receiver design for impulse radio ultra-wideband communication","sourcePdf":"5108-tw0812-ke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087153S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4712731,"authors":[{"name":"Der-Jiunn Deng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4712686/4712731/4712731-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Der-Jiunn Deng received the B.S. degree in computer science from Tung-Hai University, the M.S. degree in information management from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University in 1997, 1999, and 2005, respectively.

This strategy has a high collision probability and channel utilization is degraded in bursty arrivals or congested scenarios. Besides, the standard backoff mechanism may treat noise corruption as packet collisions. In this paper, we identify the relationship between backoff parameters, contention level, and channel BER in order to propose a simple, but yet well-performing distributed algorithm that allows a station to dynamically adjust its contention window size based on turn-around-time measurement of channel status. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted to evaluate its performance. The proposed scheme works very well in providing a substantial performance improvement in heavy loaded and error-prone WLAN environments.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4712686/04712731.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4712686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"5129","endPage":"5135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contention window optimization for ieee 802.11 DCF access control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4712731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Contention window optimization for ieee 802.11 DCF access control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4712731/","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4712731/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416552","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contention window optimization for ieee 802.11 DCF access control","sourcePdf":"5129-tw0812-deng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091941S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4712686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4712686","articleId":"4712731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4712924,"authors":[{"name":"Roald Otnes","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Horten, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4749348/4712924/4712924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roald Otnes (S'00\u2013M'03) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunications from the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, Trondheim, Norway, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.

Thus, it is very important to identify these elephant flows in traffic engineering, network operation and management. One can easily keep counters for a few elephant flows using a small amount of fast memory (SRAM). Thus a reasonable goal is to devise an algorithm that identifies elephant flows using a limited SRAM memory. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this issue by using an identifying Elephant flows based on a Scalable Non-uniform Sampling algorithm (ESNS) to make the monitoring system self-adjustable to the varying monitored traffic. The paper use CERNET traces to compare the performance the ESNS algorithm with the sample and hold algorithm, and sampled algorithm.

So it is very important to design a distributed spectrum offering scheme that can coordinate the spectrum offering scheme adapt to dynamic topology with only local information. In this paper, we propose a game-based distributed spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio network with dynamic topology in which multiple primary users with spectrum opportunity compete with each other to offer spectrum access to the secondary users. We obtain the Nash equilibrium of the game and analyze the impacts of the dynamic topology on the Nash equilibrium. In addition, we present a iterative distributed spectrum offering algorithm for the case when the primary users can not observe the current action and utility adopted by others. We theoretically prove that the algorithm can converge to Nash equilibrium within a few iterative steps. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better performances.","doi":"10.1109/ICCT.2008.4716107","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700821/4716080/04716107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCT.2008.4716107","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology","startPage":"50","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient game-based competitive spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio networks with dynamic topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient game-based competitive spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio networks with dynamic topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4716107/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4716107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424971","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient game-based competitive spectrum offering scheme in cognitive radio networks with dynamic topology","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046712S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700821","isNumber":"4716080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700821","xplore-issue":"4716080","articleId":"4716107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4716112,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085417251"},{"name":"Zeng Qi Sun","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zeng Qi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37280347900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2250-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2251-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4716112","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Networked control systems","Time varying systems","Sampling methods","Delay","Control systems","Uncertain systems","State feedback","Stochastic processes","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control engineering computing","delays","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","Markov processes","random processes","sampling methods","stability","state feedback","stochastic systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked control system","stochastic stabilization","time-varying sampling period","random delay","stochastic control method","Markov chain","discrete-time Markovian jump system","parameter uncertainty","delay-compensating control term","augmented state feedback controller","linear matrix inequality","stochastic Lyapunov function"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a stochastic control method for networked control systems (NCSs) with time-varying sampling periods and random delay.

The test data prove that, the three-way Doherty power amplifier with uneven power drive has higher efficiency than the classical two-way Doherty power amplifier when the input signal has a high peak-to-average power ratio.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Peak to average power ratio","Linearity","Operational amplifiers","Costs","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory","Testing","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit testing","code division multiple access","MIS devices","power amplifiers","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-way Doherty power amplifier","uneven power drive","LDMOS devices","WCDMA signal","high peak-to-average power ratio","frequency 2.14 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["three-way Doherty","uneven power drive","drain efficiency","adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCT.2008.4716245","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE International Conference on Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700821/4716080/04716245.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCT.2008.4716245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-way Doherty power amplifier with uneven power drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-way Doherty power amplifier with uneven power drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4716245/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4716245/","accessionNumber":"10425102","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-way Doherty power amplifier with uneven power drive","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051946S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700821","isNumber":"4716080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700821","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4716080","articleId":"4716245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4716263,"authors":[{"name":"Faxun Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Faxun Jin","id":"37650084600"},{"name":"Jian Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Jian Tang","id":"37653832800"},{"name":"Zhong feng Wang","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"lastName":"Zhong feng Wang","id":"37662046800"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Li Guo","id":"37651437100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2250-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2251-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4716263","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Radix-8 Log-MAP recursion VLSI architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716263","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Decoding","CMOS technology","Approximation algorithms","Design optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Throughput","Hardware","AWGN channels","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","CMOS integrated circuits","decoding","turbo codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed Radix-8 Log-MAP recursion","VLSI architecture","turbo decoder recursion architecture","algorithmic approximation","architectural optimization","CMOS technology","AWGN channel","bit rate 693 Mbit/s","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radix-8","Turbo code","Log-MAP","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high speed Radix-8 Log-MAP turbo decoder recursion architecture: algorithmic approximation and architectural optimization are incorporated in the proposed designs to reduce the critical path.

It is found that the capture rate scales directly with c and that it depends linearly on Q. At low Q the capture rate is only partially due to gravitational sedimentation of beads. At higher Q an additional term proportional to Q becomes important, which is attributed to capture of beads by the magnetic fields near the sensor. It is shown that beads can be washed off the sensor surface.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716426","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716426","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/4703548/4716361/04716426.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"245","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic sensors","Microfluidics","Biosensors","Nanotechnology","Hall effect","Monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Fluid dynamics","Nanobioscience","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow sensors","Hall effect transducers","magnetic fields","magnetic sensors","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bead capture","bead release","microfluidic system","planar Hall effect magnetic sensors","biological agents detection","surface treated magnetic beads","fluid injection system"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bead capture and release on a magnetic sensor in a microfluidic system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4716426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bead capture and release on a magnetic sensor in a microfluidic system","htmlLink":"/document/4716426/","accessionNumber":"10425211","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bead capture and release on a magnetic sensor in a microfluidic system","confLoc":"Lecce, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12102008-00065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053218S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4703548","isNumber":"4716361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4703548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4716361","articleId":"4716426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4716434,"authors":[{"name":"Gian Nicola Angotzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian Nicola","lastName":"Angotzi","id":"37662006300"},{"name":"Massimo Barbaro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Barbaro","id":"37372540800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2580-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2581-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"4716434","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Real time systems","Image storage","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","System testing","Pixel","Digital filters","Filtering","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS image sensors","FIR filters","IIR filters","image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS imager","embedded systems","motion-detection capabilities","digital output","low-power imager","image acquisition","frame storage","reconfigurable analog row-processor","temporal filtering","tunable 2D spatial IIR filters","programmable temporal FIR filters","A-D converters"]}],"abstract":"A CMOS, smart, low-power imager with pre-processing capabilities suitable for embedded systems, was realized and successfully tested.

This work presents a novel optical comparator which incorporates a photosensitive area into a five transistor comparator to perform thresholding. The optically active area is formed by enlarging the drain substrate p-n junction of each of the cross coupled NMOS transistors, and exposing one of them to the light, while shielding the other with metal for symmetry and dark current suppression. The cross-coupled NMOS transistors provide positive feedback to enhance detection speed and latch the result, while the PMOS input transistors provide a biasing mechanism to set an optical threshold. The device was fabricated and tested in a commercially available 3-metal 2-poly CMOS process.

The associated calibration procedure is time consuming and therefore costly. This paper presents two voltage calibration techniques that are much faster than conventional temperature techniques. Both make use of the fact that a voltage proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) can be accurately generated on chip. By measuring this voltage, the sensorpsilas actual temperature can be determined, whereupon the sensor can be trimmed to correct for its dominant source of error: spread in the on-chip voltage reference. The first calibration technique consists of measuring the (small) PTAT voltage directly, while the second, more robust alternative does so indirectly, by using an external reference voltage and the on-chip ADC. Experimental results from a prototype fabricated in 0.7 mum CMOS technology show that after calibration and trimming, these two techniques result in 3sigma inaccuracies of plusmn0.15degC and plusmn0.25degC, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716551","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/4703548/4716361/04716551.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage calibration of smart temperature sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4716551/","displayDocTitle":"Voltage calibration of smart temperature sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10425336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4716551/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage calibration of smart temperature sensors","confLoc":"Lecce, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12102008-00190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048048S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4703548","isNumber":"4716361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4703548","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4716361","articleId":"4716551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4716598,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We demonstrate the ability to amplify fluorescent output using a photonic crystal (PC) surface, thereby boosting detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude, and apply the approach to several life science applications. We achieve fluorescence amplification by two distinct mechanisms: First, intense optical near fields that develop on a the surfaces of a PC slab can be designed to coincide with the absorption wavelength of a fluorophore, resulting in enhanced excitation compared to the same fluorophore excited on an optically inactive surface. Second, PC resonances can be designed to coincide with the fluorophore emission wavelength, enabling enhanced extraction of light. The all-dielectric PC structure offers several important advantages with respect to metal-enhanced fluorescence using surface plasmons.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluorescence","Photonic crystals","Slabs","Optical surface waves","Biomedical optical imaging","Stimulated emission","Optical sensors","Surface waves","Molecular biophysics","Gene expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","cellular biophysics","diseases","fluorescence","genetics","molecular biophysics","patient diagnosis","photonic crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluorescence amplification","photonic crystal slabs","biomolecules detection","cells detection","fluorescent tags","gene expression analysis","biomarker-based disease diagnosis","cell imaging","photonic crystal surface","detection sensitivity","life science applications","absorption wavelength","enhanced excitation","optically inactive surface","PC resonance","fluorophore emission wavelength"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716653","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/4703548/4716361/04716653.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4716361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fluorescence amplification using photonic crystal slabs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4716653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fluorescence amplification using photonic crystal slabs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4716653/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4716653/","accessionNumber":"10425438","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fluorescence amplification using photonic crystal slabs","confLoc":"Lecce, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12102008-00292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064154S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4703548","isNumber":"4716361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4703548","xplore-issue":"4716361","articleId":"4716653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4716658,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Jun Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yong-Jun Shin","id":"37405271600"},{"name":"Jeong-Bong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jeong-Bong Lee","id":"37280304400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2580-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2581-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"4716658","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systems biology","Biochemistry","Kinetic theory","Motion control","Dielectrics","Microfluidics","Drives","Computer vision","Sugar","Merging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","computer vision","enzymes","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidics","high throughput imaging","systems biology","EWOD chips","ElectroWetting-On Dielectric chips","microfluidics chips","machine vision","droplet control","colorimetric enzyme reaction-based glucose assay","Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics","MATLAB SimBiology"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports a novel integrative way of studying enzyme kinetics, one of key building blocks of systems biology, using digital microfluidics-based high-throughput imaging.

A colorimetric enzyme reaction-based glucose assay kit was utilized for the enzyme kinetics study. Enzymatic reactions were initiated by merging two droplets of interest on the chip, and real-time high-throughput imaging was done for the measurement of changing color.

However, for high ratios of wind energy, the necessity of a dump load and the diesel operating constraints need to be considered. Energy storage systems offer a means of optimizing energy use and further reducing consumption of diesel fuel. This paper proposes a methodology for storage sizing based on stochastic optimization. The problem is formulated and solved using representative data. The dependence of storage sizing and the cost of delivered energy on wind penetration levels, storage efficiency, and diesel operating strategies are considered. Results demonstrate that for high wind penetration, the availability of storage, together with an appropriate diesel operating approach, can result in significant cost savings in terms of fuel and operating costs.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2004840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4762160/04717221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2004840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762160","startPage":"418","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach to Rating of Energy Storage Systems in Wind-Diesel Isolated Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach to Rating of Energy Storage Systems in Wind-Diesel Isolated Grids","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10428873","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4717221/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Optimization Approach to Rating of Energy Storage Systems in Wind-Diesel Isolated Grids","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs04-cabbey-2004840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064964S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4717221","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4717222,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hongliang Li (M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in electronics and information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2006, he joined the visual signal processing and communication laboratory (VSPC) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a Research Associate. from 2006 to 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the same laboratory in CUHK.

To speed up the detection process, a face rejection cascade is constructed to remove most of negative samples while retaining all the face samples. Then, we develop a coarse-to-fine segmentation approach to extract the faces based on a min-cut optimization. Finally, a new matting algorithm is proposed to estimate the alpha-matte based on an adaptive trimap generation method.

Online estimation of line parameters is highly desirable and various methods have been proposed in the past. These methods perform well when the measurements utilized are accurate; they may yield erroneous results when the measurements contain considerable errors. Based on nonlinear optimal estimation theory, this paper puts forward an optimal estimator for deriving the positive sequence line parameters, capable of detecting and identifying the bad measurement data, minimizing the impacts of the measurement errors and thus significantly improving the estimation accuracy. The solution is based on the distributed parameter line model and thus fully considers the effects of shunt capacitances of the line.

It is shown that under a more general 3-D angle-of-arrival (AoA) model, namely, the Fisher-Bingham five-parameter (FB5) distribution, the spatial fading correlation (SFC) that is experienced between the adjacent antenna array elements decreases as the elevation increases. The FB5 distribution does not have a known series expansion, and therefore, the defining SFC integral can only numerically be evaluated. The proposed SFC function is further extended to capture the effect of multiple clusters of scatterers in the propagation channel. We, therefore, propose a mixture SFC function that is scaled according to the probability that each cluster contributes to the channel. The parameters of the individual components that constitute the mixture are estimated by using a soft expectation maximization (soft-EM) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed model fits well with the data obtained from a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) measurement campaign in the city of Ilmenau, Germany.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2011046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04717230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2011046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Fisher\u2013Bingham Spatial Correlation Model for Multielement Antenna Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Fading","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Scattering","MIMO","Antennas and propagation","Clustering algorithms","Antenna measurements","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","MIMO communication","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fisher-Bingham spatial correlation model","multielement antenna systems","multielement antenna receiver","three-dimensional angle-of-arrival model","Fisher-Bingham five-parameter distribution","spatial fading correlation","antenna array elements","series expansion","propagation channel","probability","soft expectation maximization","multiple-input-multiple-output measurement","Germany"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fisher\u2013Bingham distribution","mixture of distributions","spatial fading correlation (SFC) function","uniform circular array (UCA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Fisher\u2013Bingham Spatial Correlation Model for Multielement Antenna Systems","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10645587","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4717230/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717230/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Fisher\u2013Bingham Spatial Correlation Model for Multielement Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-mammasis-2011046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066531S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4717230","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4717232,"authors":[{"name":"Abu T.

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm. It is thus called cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (CCPSO). The proposed CCPSO method, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Cooperative behavior involves a collection of multiple swarms that interact by exchanging information to solve a problem. The belief space is the information repository in which the individuals can store their experiences such that other individuals can learn from them indirectly. The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This study uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural networks. The FLNFN model can generate the consequent part of a nonlinear combination of input variables. Finally, the proposed FLNFN with CCPSO (FLNFN-CCPSO) is adopted in several predictive applications. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed CCPSO method performs well in predicting the time series problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370686","htmlLink":"/document/4717248/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid of Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization and Cultural Algorithm for Neural Fuzzy Networks and Its Prediction Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid of Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization and Cultural Algorithm for Neural Fuzzy Networks and Its Prediction Applications","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-lin-2002333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127237S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4735634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4735634","articleId":"4717248","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4717254,"authors":[{"name":"Travis Dierks","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"Dierks","id":"37546896900"},{"name":"S.

It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the errors for the entire formation are AS and that the NN weights are bounded as opposed to uniformly ultimately bounded stability which is typical with most NN controllers. Additionally, the stability of the formation in the presence of obstacles is examined using Lyapunov methods, and by treating other robots in the formation as obstacles, collisions within the formation do not occur. The asymptotic stability of the follower robots as well as the entire formation during an obstacle avoidance maneuver is demonstrated using Lyapunov methods, and numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical conjectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10518707","pubMedId":"19095558","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Control of Mobile Robot Formations Using RISE Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Control of Mobile Robot Formations Using RISE Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-dierks-2005122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061687S","chronDate":"April  2009","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"82","articleId":"4717254","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4717255,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Chun Hua","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717255/4717255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Chun Hua received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao City, China, in 2005.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University.

This is achieved by using variable particles in swarms to enhance the searching ability and drive particles more efficiently. Moreover, sharing principals are constructed to stop particles from falling into the local minimum and make the global optimal solution easier found by particles. Experiments were conducted on unimodal and multimodal test functions such as quadric, griewanks, rastrigin, ackley, and weierstrass, with and without coordinate rotation. The results show good performance of the EPUS-PSO in solving most benchmark problems as compared to other recent variants of the PSO.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2006628","startPage":"444","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2006628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04717260.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Population Utilization Strategy for Particle Swarm Optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717260/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Population Utilization Strategy for Particle Swarm Optimizer","volume":"39","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4717260/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10518714","pubMedId":"19095550","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Population Utilization Strategy for Particle Swarm Optimizer","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-sun-2006628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106198S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4717260","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4717261,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717261/4717261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Chen received the B.Eng. degree in control engineering from Huadong Petroleum Institute, Dongying, China, in 1982, the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the City University, London, U.K., in 1986, and the D.Sc. degree from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2005.","He has been with the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, since September 1999.

Each stage of the construction process determines an RBF node, namely, its center vector and diagonal covariance matrix, by minimizing the LOO statistics. For regression application, the LOO criterion is chosen to be the LOO mean-square error, while the LOO misclassification rate is adopted in two-class classification application. This OFS-LOO algorithm is computationally efficient, and it is capable of constructing parsimonious RBF networks that generalize well. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is fully automatic, and the user does not need to specify a termination criterion for the construction process. The effectiveness of the proposed RBF network construction procedure is demonstrated using examples taken from both regression and classification applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10518715","htmlLink":"/document/4717261/","pubMedId":"19095548","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Tunable Radial Basis Function Networks Using Orthogonal Forward Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Tunable Radial Basis Function Networks Using Orthogonal Forward Selection","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-chen-2006688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125486S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4717261","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4717263,"authors":[{"name":"Rongni Yang","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717263/4717263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rongni Yang received the B.Sc. degree in information and computational science from Shandong University, Jinan, China in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree in control science and engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China in 2008, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Department of Control Science and Engineering."]},"firstName":"Rongni","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403648800"},{"name":"Huijun Gao","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717263/4717263-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Huijun Gao (M'06) was born in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 1976.

By employing the information of probability distribution of the time delay, the original system is transformed into a T-S fuzzy model with stochastic parameter matrices. Based on the new type of T-S fuzzy model, the delay-distribution-dependent criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of the considered systems are derived by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, parallel distributed compensation approach, and the convexity of some matrix equations. The solvability of the derived criteria depends not only on the size of the delay but also on the probability distribution of the delay taking values in some intervals. The revisions of the main criteria in this paper can also be used to deal with the case when only the information of variation range of the delay is considered. It is shown by practical examples that our method can lead to very less conservative results than those by other existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04717265.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Distribution-Dependent Stability and Stabilization of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Probabilistic Interval Delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Delay effects","Probability distribution","Delay systems","Automation","Stability analysis","Control design","Stochastic systems","Stability criteria","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","compensation","control system synthesis","delays","distributed control","fuzzy control","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","mean square error methods","probability","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-distribution-dependent stability","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system","probabilistic interval delay","stabilization control design","probability distribution","time delay","stochastic parameter matrix","mean-square exponential stability","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method","parallel distributed compensation approach","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay distribution dependent","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional","probability distribution","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy model"]},{"kwd":["Delay distribution dependent","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional","probability distribution","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Distribution-Dependent Stability and Stabilization of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Probabilistic Interval Delay","volume":"39","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4717265/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10518719","pubMedId":"19095544","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Distribution-Dependent Stability and Stabilization of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems With Probabilistic Interval Delay","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-yue-2007496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143241S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4717265","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4717266,"authors":[{"name":"Damien Ernst","affiliation":["Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research, Brussels, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Li\u00e8ge, Liege, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717266/4717266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Damien Ernst (M'98) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He spent the period 2003\u20132006 with the University of Li\u00e8ge as a Postdoctoral Researcher of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS), Brussels, Belgium, and held during this period positions as Visiting Researcher with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

The considered MPC approach exploits an analytical model of the system dynamics and cost function and computes open-loop policies by applying an interior-point solver to a minimization problem in which the system dynamics are represented by equality constraints. The considered RL approach infers in a model-free way closed-loop policies from a set of system trajectories and instantaneous cost values by solving a sequence of batch-mode supervised learning problems. The results obtained provide insight into the pros and cons of the two approaches and show that RL may certainly be competitive with MPC even in contexts where a good deterministic system model is available.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04717266.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Versus Model Predictive Control: A Comparison on a Power System Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Versus Model Predictive Control: A Comparison on a Power System Problem","volume":"39","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717266/","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10518721","pubMedId":"19095542","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717266/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning Versus Model Predictive Control: A Comparison on a Power System Problem","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ernst-2007630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177235S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4717266","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4717268,"authors":[{"name":"Xu-Ying Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717268/4717268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu-Ying Liu received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Nanjing University, Nanjing, in 2006.

BalanceCascade trains the learners sequentially, where in each step, the majority class examples that are correctly classified by the current trained learners are removed from further consideration. Experimental results show that both methods have higher Area Under the ROC Curve, F-measure, and G-mean values than many existing class-imbalance learning methods.

First, we present a polynomial fuzzy model and controller that are more general representations of the well-known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and controller, respectively. Second, we derive a guaranteed cost control design condition based on polynomial Lyapunov functions. Hence, the design approach discussed in this paper is more general than the existing LMI approaches (to T-S fuzzy control system designs) based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. The design condition realizes a guaranteed cost control by minimizing the upper bound of a given performance function. In addition, the design condition in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and is numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recent developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity of the design approach, two design examples are provided. The first example deals with a complicated nonlinear system. The second example presents micro helicopter control. Both the examples show that our approach provides more extensive design results for the existing LMI approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2006639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4802395/04717286.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2006639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guaranteed Cost Control of Polynomial Fuzzy Systems via a Sum of Squares Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717286/","displayDocTitle":"Guaranteed Cost Control of Polynomial Fuzzy Systems via a Sum of Squares Approach","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10518724","pubMedId":"19095549","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717286/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guaranteed Cost Control of Polynomial Fuzzy Systems via a Sum of Squares Approach","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-tanaka-2006639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056044S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4802395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"4802395","articleId":"4717286","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4717287,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Schlosser","affiliation":["Institute of Physics-Nano and Micro Systems, University of German Armed Forces, Neubiberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4723893/4717287/4717287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Schlosser was born in 1978 in Bobingen, Germany.

Its device characteristics have been subject to a variety of experimental and theoretical studies. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of using a high-kappa gate dielectric in the tunnel FET compared to a standard silicon oxide with same equivalent oxide thickness, which exhibits a quite different behavior compared to a conventional MOSFET due to its totally different working principle. It turns out that the fringing field effect, while deteriorating conventional MOSFET characteristics, leads to a much higher on-current comparable with actual conventional MOSFETs, a subthreshold slope of the tunnel FET lower than the theoretical limit for conventional MOSFETs, and a massive improved inverter delay, underlining its prospect for future applications. This leads to the conclusion that high-kappa materials with permittivities > 30 can advantageously be used in CMOS technology, giving rise to further technological development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4717287/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370174","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fringing-Induced Drain Current Improvement in the Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor With High- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa$</tex></formula> Gate Dielectrics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fringing-Induced Drain Current Improvement in the Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor With High- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\kappa$</tex></formula> Gate Dielectrics","sourcePdf":"ted-schlosser-2008375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171387S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4723893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4723893","articleId":"4717287","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4717289,"authors":[{"name":"Yesim Oniz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4802395/4717289/4717289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yesim Oniz (S'06) was born in Istanbul, Turkey, on July 10, 1981.

Unknown uncertainties are compensated for using the function approximation capability of neural networks. The unknown virtual control directions are dealt with by Nussbaum functions. By utilizing Lyapunov synthesis, the closed-loop control system is proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero.

The method is based on the assumptions that the linear mixing model is valid and that, due to the resolution of the image, most pixels are mixtures of common substances, of which pure pixels (not mixtures) are rare. In the first stage of the algorithm, the classes associated with the background, which are the dominant classes in the image, are found by clustering the image pixels. The resulting clusters may be considered as representatives of the background classes in the image. In order to determine the anomalous pixels, a threshold may be applied to the distance between the pixel spectrum and the cluster centers. However, pixels corresponding to anomalies and pure substances will both show high distances. If we consider that the background classes are themselves most likely mixtures of other materials, the pixels within the convex hull formed by the background classes will have positive fractions that are smaller than one. The pure substances, however, will be outside such a convex hull and will show negative or superunity fractions. Pixels with such mixing proportions are explained as linear combinations of the background classes and, therefore, as not true anomalies. Pixels corresponding to anomalies, however, when expressed as linear combinations of the background classes, show high residual error even with negative and superunity mixing proportions. We use the unmixing spectral linear model without the nonnegativity constraint to distinguish between false anomalies corresponding to pure substances and real man-made anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2009952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4747356/04717301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2009952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747356","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Unmixing With Negative and Superunity Abundances for Subpixel Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Unmixing With Negative and Superunity Abundances for Subpixel Anomaly Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10371122","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4717301/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Unmixing With Negative and Superunity Abundances for Subpixel Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"lgrs-petrou-2009952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073012S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4747356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4747356","articleId":"4717301","onlineDate":"16 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4717306,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando H.

In the first part, the main methods used in the analysis of interictal EEG/MEG epileptiform spikes are presented and discussed. Source and volume conductor models are passed in review, namely the equivalent dipole source concept, the requirements for adequate time and spatial sampling, the question of how to validate source solutions, particularly by comparing solutions obtained using scalp and intracranial EEG signals, EEG & MEG data, or EEG simultaneously recorded with fMRI (BOLD signals). In the second part, methods used for the characterization of seizures are considered, namely dipolar modeling of spikes at seizure onset, decomposition of seizure EEG signals into sets of orthogonal spatio-temporal components, and also methods (linear and nonlinear) of estimating seizure propagation. In the third part, the crucial issue of how the transition between interictal and seizure activity takes place is examined. In particular the vicissitudes of the efforts along the road to seizure prediction are shortly reviewed. It is argued that this question can be reduced to the problem of estimating the excitability state of neuronal populations in the course of time as a seizure approaches. The value of active probing methods in contrast with passive analytical methods is emphasized. In the fourth part modeling aspects are considered in the light of two special kinds of epilepsies, absences characterized by spike-and-wave discharges and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. These two types correspond to different scenarios regarding the transition to epileptic seizures, namely the former is a case of a jump transition and the latter is a typical case of gradual transition. In conclusion, the necessity of developing comprehensive computational models of epileptic seizures is emphasized.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2008.2008246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/4689462/04717306.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2008.2008246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of EEG/MEG Signal Processing and Modeling in the Diagnostic and Management of Epilepsy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717306/","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of EEG/MEG Signal Processing and Modeling in the Diagnostic and Management of Epilepsy","volume":"1","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10495715","pubMedId":"22274902","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717306/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of EEG/MEG Signal Processing and Modeling in the Diagnostic and Management of Epilepsy","sourcePdf":"rbme-lopesdasilva-2008246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175849S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"4689462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4689462","articleId":"4717306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4717355,"authors":[{"name":"Bojan Stumberger","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Bojan","lastName":"Stumberger","id":"37621770000"},{"name":"Gorazd Stumberger","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Gorazd","lastName":"Stumberger","id":"37374355400"},{"name":"Miralem Hadziselimovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Miralem","lastName":"Hadziselimovic","id":"38188795400"},{"name":"Tine Marcic","affiliation":["Research and Development Centre for Electric Machines, TECES, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Tine","lastName":"Marcic","id":"37658573900"},{"name":"Peter Virtic","affiliation":["Research and Development Centre for Electric Machines, TECES, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Virtic","id":"37657932100"},{"name":"Mladen Trlep","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Trlep","id":"37283753200"},{"name":"Viktor Gorican","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Gorican","id":"38148023700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717355","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnet motors","Rotors","Reluctance motors","Synchronous motors","Stators","Power generation","Magnetic flux","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-element analysis","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with flux barriers","IPMSMFB rotor structure","stator construction","magnetic field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant power speed range","flux weakening","interior permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a finite-element method-based design and analysis of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with flux barriers (IPMSMFB).

The method is based on the two-axis dynamic model of a three-phase machine with wye-connected three-phase stator winding. The d-axis is defined with the magnetic axis of permanent magnets (\u201cflux linkage vector\u201d due to the permanent magnets), while the q-axis is displaced by electrical <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\pi/2$</tex></formula>. The tested machine is supplied by a controlled voltage source inverter. Voltage in one axis is changed in the stepwise manner, while current in the orthogonal axis is closed loop controlled. The characteristic flux linkage versus current in the form of a hysteresis loop is determined numerically using the time behavior of measured applied voltage and responding current in the same axis. Unfortunately, the currents induced in the machine's damping windings or squirrel cage disturb the flux linkage characteristic determined in this way. Therefore, only the final points of each hysteresis loop, where the currents induced in the damping windings already died-out, can be used as correct points of the machine's magnetically nonlinear iron core characteristic. The proposed method is confirmed by the tests performed with a single three-phase stator and four different rotors: the reluctance rotor, the reluctance rotor with squirrel cage, the reluctance rotor with inserted permanent magnets, and the reluctance rotor with inserted permanent magnets and squirrel cage. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Electric machines","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Iron","Magnetic cores","Damping","Machine windings","Permanent magnets","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","machine windings","magnetic cores","permanent magnets","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","magnetically nonlinear iron core","anisotropic iron core","damping windings","permanent magnets","three-phase machine","three-phase stator winding","flux linkage characteristic","reluctance rotor","squirrel cage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric machines","magnetic cores","nondestructive testing","nonlinear magnetics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717424.pdf","startPage":"4341","endPage":"4344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Method for Determining Magnetically Nonlinear Characteristics of Electric Machines With Magnetically Nonlinear and Anisotropic Iron Core, Damping Windings, and Permanent Magnets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Method for Determining Magnetically Nonlinear Characteristics of Electric Machines With Magnetically Nonlinear and Anisotropic Iron Core, Damping Windings, and Permanent Magnets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717424/","volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717424/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10362099","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Method for Determining Magnetically Nonlinear Characteristics of Electric Machines With Magnetically Nonlinear and Anisotropic Iron Core, Damping Windings, and Permanent Magnets","sourcePdf":"tmag-gtumberger-2001319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041164S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4717441,"authors":[{"name":"Hwang-Bin Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hwang-Bin","lastName":"Lim","id":"37827676200"},{"name":"Jung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717441","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Couplings","Sensorless control","Iron","Machine vector control","Parameter estimation","Synchronous motors","Finite element methods","Stators","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","machine vector control","position control","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online observer system","synchronous reluctance motor","finite element method","dynamic characteristics analysis","moving mesh technique","coupled transient FEM","Preisach model","position sensorless control system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FEM","online observer system","Preisach model","sensorless vector control","synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM)"]}],"abstract":"This study deals with the dynamic characteristics analysis of synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) using finite element method in which the moving mesh technique is considered.

Write head field distributions, calculated by the finite-element method, are presented for various head pole structures with side- and trailing-shields to improve head field gradient. Optimization of the pole configuration increased the gradient to over 500 Oe/nm for a head-to-soft magnetic under layer (SUL) spacing of 14 nm. Using the head field distribution, a recording performance analysis by micromagnetic simulation indicated that the write margin was improved.

Each sector is encoded by either 4- or 0.5-kB-long codes. Both quasi-cyclic (QC) and nonquasi-cyclic (non-QC) nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are designed, and a set of simulations in a mixture of 10% additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and 90% position jitter noise power, with and without turbo equalization and with a rereading technique, is presented. The results show that sector-long codes perform better than 0.5-kB codes for all decoding schemes considered. In addition, the erasure correction capabilities of these nonbinary LDPC codes are calculated under both maximum-likelihood decoding and iterative decoding, and, as expected, longer codes can correct longer erasures. QC and non-QC nonbinary LDPC codes exhibit similar performance and have almost the same erasure correction capability under iterative decoding. Because of their efficient encoding, QC nonbinary LDPC codes are a good choice for perpendicular recording channels with 4-kB sectors, and offer a tradeoff between performance and code length.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717467.pdf","startPage":"3781","endPage":"3784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Codes for 4-kB Sectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC Codes for 4-kB Sectors","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4717467/","accessionNumber":"10362380","volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonbinary LDPC Codes for 4-kB Sectors","sourcePdf":"tmag-cruz-2002368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034174S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4717471,"authors":[{"name":"Bashir Mahdi Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Faculty of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Bashir Mahdi","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37407860300"},{"name":"Jawad Faiz","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Faculty of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Faiz","id":"37272819800"},{"name":"M.

Use of this index makes it also possible to precisely determine the eccentricity degree. The index is the amplitude of the harmonic components with a particular frequency pattern. Occurrence and increase of the fault degree cause the rise of amplitude of the harmonic components which can be used to diagnose the fault and determine its degree. To evaluate the ability of the proposed index for static eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, the correlation between index and eccentricity degree is calculated. Then a three-layer artificial neural network is employed to classify the current and torque profiles to one of the four possible classes of eccentricities. After all, a white Gaussian noise is added to the both measured current and torque and robustness of the proposed index is analyzed with respect to the noise variance. A PMSM under static eccentricity fault is modeled using time stepping finite element method. This modeling includes all geometrical and physical characteristics of the machine components, non-uniform permeance of the air gap and non-uniform characteristics of the PM material. Use of this precise modeling makes it possible to access the demanded signals for a very high precision processing.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717471","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Permanent magnet motors","Finite element methods","Gaussian noise","Noninvasive treatment","Frequency","Artificial neural networks","Current measurement","Torque measurement","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","finite element analysis","Gaussian noise","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static eccentricity fault diagnosis","permanent magnet synchronous motors","time stepping finite element method","noninvasive diagnosis","harmonic components","frequency pattern","three-layer artificial neural network","torque profiles","current profiles","white Gaussian noise","robustness","physical characteristics","geometrical characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","permanent magnet synchronous motor","static eccentricity","time stepping finite element"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717471.pdf","startPage":"4297","endPage":"4300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001534","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using Time Stepping Finite Element Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717471/","displayDocTitle":"Static Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using Time Stepping Finite Element Method","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362408","htmlLink":"/document/4717471/","volume":"44","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using Time Stepping Finite Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-faiz-2001534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04624S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4717474,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A semi-analytical magnetic field solution of regular square shaped magnets is presented and used to approximate the airgap field produced by the trapezoidal shaped PMs. The method is based on dividing the magnets into several radial layers and superposition of the fields to calculate the total magnetic field. The results are compared to finite element analysis (FEA) and show excellent agreement. Using this magnetic field solution, the effect of the shape of the magnets on the magnetic field waveform is analyzed by means of a parametric search.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","startPage":"4305","endPage":"4308","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717487.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Halbach Permanent Magnet Shape Selection for Slotless Tubular Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4717487/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Halbach Permanent Magnet Shape Selection for Slotless Tubular Actuators","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362016","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Halbach Permanent Magnet Shape Selection for Slotless Tubular Actuators","sourcePdf":"tmag-paulides-2001536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048393S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4717525,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These scratches, which may occur on the disk's surface during head/disk contact, cause demagnetization that results in read/write errors. The scratch-induced demagnetization is thus investigated by the scratch test, observation of atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy, and analysis of transmission electronic microscopy. It was found that the angle of the grain in the recording layer, which is vertically orientated on a PMR disk, was tilted under the scratch. These analyses revealed that scratch-induced demagnetization is caused mainly by plastic deformation which results in grain tilt in the recording layer, rather than by stress. Therefore, a dense and not-easily titled grain structure in the recording layer is needed to produce a reliable hard disk drive (HDD).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717566/","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4717566/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10362050","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scratch-Induced Demagnetization of Perpendicular Magnetic Disk","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scratch-Induced Demagnetization of Perpendicular Magnetic Disk","sourcePdf":"tmag-furukawa-2001593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042914S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4717600,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Trapanese","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Trapanese","id":"37266408500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717600","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Magnetic materials","Magnetic hysteresis","Saturation magnetization","Telecommunications","Mathematical model","Voice mail","Magnetic susceptibility","Differential equations","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","magnetic hysteresis","multilayer perceptrons","neural nets","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter identification","reduced vector Preisach model","neural networks","multilayer perceptron","Levenberg-Marquadt training algorithm","magnetization hysteresis curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric machines","identification procedures","magnetic materials","neural networks","Preisach model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717600","abstract":"This paper presents a methodology for identifying reduced vector Preisach model parameters by using neural networks.

Small signal measurements show a flat frequency response up to 20 MHz with a self resonant frequency of 130 MHz. The inductance at low frequency is approximately 440 nH with a dc resistance of 0.5 Omega , and a high quality factor of 11.7 at 5.5 MHz. The current handling capability test shows less than 10% decrease in inductance at 500-mA current. The performance of the microinductor has been compared to a conventional chip inductor in a commercially available 8-MHz buck converter. The converter maximum efficiency when using the microinductor is shown to be approximately 3% lower than the one using the conventional discrete chip inductor. However, the profile of the microinductor is much lower than that of the discrete chip inductor. The maximum efficiency of the microinductor in the converter is estimated to be approximately 92%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717618.pdf","endPage":"4099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-Film-Integrated Power Inductor on Si and Its Performance in an 8-MHz Buck Converter","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001584","startPage":"4096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Thin-Film-Integrated Power Inductor on Si and Its Performance in an 8-MHz Buck Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717618/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10362386","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4717618/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-Film-Integrated Power Inductor on Si and Its Performance in an 8-MHz Buck Converter","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2001584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065373S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4717620,"authors":[{"name":"Nan-Hsiung Yeh","affiliation":["Seagate Technology Limited Liability Company, Fremont, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nan-Hsiung","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37339071200"},{"name":"Philip L.

However, the performance usually suffers at higher code rate. A scheme to improve BER of TPC/SPC at higher code rate is proposed. By adding cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to TPC/SPC, a sub-block can be ensured error free after passing both the parity check and CRC. At the completion of each iteration, the messages from the error free sub-blocks are modified to greatly increase their confidence levels. The artificially high confidence level from those error free sub-block bits results in much more efficient iterations subsequently and greatly lowers the ultimate BER. It is found that enhanced message passing combined with noise prediction maximum likelihood (NPML) detection in the soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) gives the best performance. Spinstand head/media signals passed through software channel are used to validate the channel performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Message passing","Product codes","Parity check codes","Cyclic redundancy check","Bit error rate","Iterative decoding","Error correction codes","Maximum likelihood detection","Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","error correction codes","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood detection","message passing","parity check codes","turbo codes","Viterbi detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced message passing","turbo product code","single parity check","error correction capability","PRML channel","cyclic redundancy check","noise prediction maximum likelihood detection","soft output Viterbi algorithm","spinstand head/media signals","software channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative decoding","magnetic recording","partial response signaling","turbo codes","Viterbi detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717620","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002406","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002406","startPage":"3769","endPage":"3772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Message Passing in Turbo Product Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Message Passing in Turbo Product Code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717620/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4717620/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362388","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Message Passing in Turbo Product Code","sourcePdf":"tmag-yeh-2002406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03719S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4717640,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen N.

By comparing the performance of these two motors, it is shown that the proposed LSPM exhibits higher power factor and efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2001538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717651.pdf","startPage":"4417","endPage":"4420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Large Capacity Line-Start Permanent-Magnet Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Large Capacity Line-Start Permanent-Magnet Motor","volume":"44","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717651/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Large Capacity Line-Start Permanent-Magnet Motor","sourcePdf":"tmag-lu-2001538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039618S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4717673,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Fukami","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Device Platforms Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Fukami","id":"37294546600"},{"name":"Tetsuhiro Suzuki","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Device Platforms Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuhiro","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37290094600"},{"name":"Norikazu Ohshima","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Device Platforms Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Norikazu","lastName":"Ohshima","id":"37316448500"},{"name":"Kiyokazu Nagahara","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Device Platforms Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyokazu","lastName":"Nagahara","id":"37294555600"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Ishiwata","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Device Platforms Research Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Ishiwata","id":"37300114600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717673","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":355},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717673","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Threshold current","Magnetic domain walls","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Magnetic anisotropy","Strips","Motion estimation","Writing","Magnetic properties","Magnetic domains","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exchange interactions (electron)","magnetic domain walls","magnetisation","MRAM devices","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrinsic threshold current density","domain wall motion","nanostrips","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","low-write-current MRAMs","magnetic random access memories","writing properties","micromagnetic simulation","strip thickness","magnetization","magnetocrystalline anisotropy","exchange stiffness","1D analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current-induced domain wall (DW) motion","magnetic random access memory (MRAM)","micromagnetic simulation","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we have calculated the intrinsic threshold current density of domain wall (DW) motion in nanostrips with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and have estimated writing properties of magnetic random access memories (MRAMs) with DW motion.

The distribution of ferromagnetic material is represented by introducing a level set function into the definition of the magnetic reluctivity. The optimization problem is defined to obtain optimal configurations that maximize the magnetic energy of actuators under a minimum bound of total volume. The movement of the implicit moving boundaries of the structure is driven by a transformation of design sensitivities of the objective and the constraints into speed functions that govern the level set propagation. The proposed method is applied to the structural design of magnetic actuators, and is confirmed to be useful for achieving optimal configurations that deliver higher performance and lighter weight designs.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002784","startPage":"4037","endPage":"4040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717689.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Actuator Design Using Level Set Based Topology Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717689/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Actuator Design Using Level Set Based Topology Optimization","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4717689/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10362272","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Actuator Design Using Level Set Based Topology Optimization","sourcePdf":"tmag-min-2002784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04404S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4717691,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Ju Mun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Ju","lastName":"Mun","id":"37650177400"},{"name":"Yong Hyun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Hyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37654351100"},{"name":"Jung Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717691","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":703},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper deals with an automatic rotor optimum design strategy based on torque/volume for a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM).

In this paper, we introduce a shielding strategy for magneto-electronic devices and demonstrate a case study to achieve shielding factor above 1000 with cylindrical shell length to diameter ratio below 0.3 and with end-cap openings for signal and power bus connections.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"4175","endPage":"4178","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002798","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717757.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Shielding Design for Magneto-Electronic Devices Protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717757/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Shielding Design for Magneto-Electronic Devices Protection","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362274","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4717757/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Shielding Design for Magneto-Electronic Devices Protection","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2002798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046903S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4717760,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"},{"name":"Dimitar Dimitrov","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitar","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37317201500"},{"name":"Harry Liu","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279500700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717760","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":619},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Random access memory","Magnetic tunneling","CMOS technology","Space technology","Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS memory circuits","Circuit simulation","Magnetic analysis","Coupling circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","magnetic storage","magnetic tunnelling","micromagnetics","random-access storage","SPICE","spin polarised transport","thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spin torque random access memory design","CMOS technology node","dynamic magnetic tunneling junction-CMOS model","micromagnetic simulation","CMOS SPICE circuit simulation","thermal stability","CMOS driving strength","magnetic solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS 22 nm technology node","magnetic random access memory","MTJ","spin torque"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717760","abstract":"Spin torque random access memory (ST-MRAM) design spaces down to CMOS 22 nm technology node are explored using a dynamic magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ)-CMOS model.

The radial force which is the main source of vibration is computed from two-dimensional (2D) transient magnetic finite-element analysis (FEA) and compared in both time and frequency domains. At the same output power, the radial force of 6/4 SRM is found to be more than two times as that of 12/8 SRM. Three-dimensional structural finite-element analysis (3D FEA) is used to study the mechanical characteristics. It can be concluded from static structural analysis that the maximum total deformation could be reduced to 1/26 if the motor is designed with 12/8 structure instead of 6/4. The dominant vibration modes are verified by modal analysis and stationary test. It is also found that the vibration and noise are dramatically reduced for 12/8 SRM during experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4717307/04717766.pdf","startPage":"4131","endPage":"4134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2002533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of 12/8 and 6/4 Switched Reluctance Motor: Noise and Vibration Aspects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Vibrations","Reluctance machines","Magnetic noise","Transient analysis","Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Computational modeling","Magnetic domains","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","finite element analysis","reluctance motors","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","vibration","noise characteristics","radial force","2D transient magnetic finite-element analysis","3D structural finite-element analysis","maximum total deformation","modal analysis","stationary test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise","radial force","switched reluctance motor","vibration","2D transient magnetic FEA","3D structural FEA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of 12/8 and 6/4 Switched Reluctance Motor: Noise and Vibration Aspects","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4717766/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10362331","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of 12/8 and 6/4 Switched Reluctance Motor: Noise and Vibration Aspects","sourcePdf":"tmag-cho-2002533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035746S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4717307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4717307","articleId":"4717766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4717767,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Chul Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun Chul","lastName":"Choi","id":"37632161400"},{"name":"Hyeong-Seok Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292774700"},{"name":"Jung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4717767","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Response surface methodology","Reluctance motors","Shape","Iron","Stators","Finite element methods","Rotors","Algorithm design and analysis","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","reluctance motors","response surface methodology","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous reluctance motor","SynRM","optimum design criteria","maximum torque density","minimum torque ripple","rated wattage","response surface methodology","finite element method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element method (FEM)","response surface methodology (RSM)","synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM)","torque ripple"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with optimum design criteria for maximum torque density and minimum torque ripple of synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) according to the rated wattage using response surface methodology (RSM).

Then the application model with the imported magnetization provides the demagnetizing field along the magnetization vector at the given temperature and current. The recoil line model is used to recalculate the magnetization vector for the operating points fallen below the knee of demagnetization of the major or minor B-H curve.

In the context of asymmetric threats, the detection of an abnormal situation refers to the discovery of suspicious activities of a hostile nation or group out of noisy, scattered, and partial intelligence data. The problem becomes complex in a low signal-to-noise ratio environment, such as asymmetric threats, because the ldquosignalrdquo observations are far fewer than ldquonoiserdquo observations. Furthermore, the signal observations are ldquohiddenrdquo in the noise. In this paper, we illustrate the capabilities of hidden Markov models (HMMs), combined with feature-aided tracking, for the detection of asymmetric threats. A transaction-based probabilistic model is proposed to combine HMMs and feature-aided tracking. A procedure analogous to Page's test is used for the quickest detection of abnormal events. The simulation results show that our method is able to detect the modeled pattern of an asymmetric threat with a high performance as compared to a maximum likelihood-based data mining technique. Performance analysis shows that the detection of HMMs improves with increase in the complexity of HMMs (i.e., the number of states in an HMM).","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2007944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4717820/04717834.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2007944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection via Feature-Aided Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717834/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection via Feature-Aided Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10361257","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717834/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection via Feature-Aided Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"tsmca-singh-2007944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082489S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4717820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4717820","articleId":"4717834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4717835,"authors":[{"name":"Satnam Singh","affiliation":["General Motors India Science Laboratory, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4717820/4717835/4717835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Satnam Singh (S'00\u2013M'08) received the B.E. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Rookree, India, in 1996, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wyoming, Laramie, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2007.","He is currently a Senior Researcher with General Motors India Science Laboratory, Bangalore, India.

This paper develops near-optimal algorithms for dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD) problems in the presence of imperfect test outcomes. The DMFD problem is to determine the most likely evolution of component states, the one that best explains the observed test outcomes. Here, we discuss four formulations of the DMFD problem. These include the deterministic situation corresponding to perfectly observed coupled Markov decision processes to several partially observed factorial hidden Markov models ranging from the case where the imperfect test outcomes are functions of tests only to the case where the test outcomes are functions of faults and tests, as well as the case where the false alarms are associated with the nominal (fault free) case only. All these formulations are intractable NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Our solution scheme can be viewed as a two-level coordinated solution framework for the DMFD problem. At the top (coordination) level, we update the Lagrange multipliers (coordination variables, dual variables) using the subgradient method. At the bottom level, we use a dynamic programming technique (specifically, the Viterbi decoding or Max-sum algorithm) to solve each of the subproblems, one for each component state sequence. The key advantage of our approach is that it provides an approximate duality gap, which is a measure of the suboptimality of the DMFD solution. Computational results on real-world problems are presented. A detailed performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is also discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Testing","Electromagnetic interference","Heuristic algorithms","Hidden Markov models","Lagrangian functions","Dynamic programming","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive engineering","condition monitoring","decision theory","duality (mathematics)","dynamic programming","fault diagnosis","fault trees","gradient methods","hidden Markov models","maintenance engineering","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic multiple fault diagnosis","imperfect test","unreliable sensor","electromagnetic interference","environmental condition","near-optimal algorithm","perfectly observed coupled Markov decision process","partially observed factorial hidden Markov model","false alarm","fault free","NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem","Lagrange multiplier","subgradient method","dynamic programming","duality gap"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic faults","hidden Markov models","imperfect tests","intermittent faults","multiple fault diagnosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2007986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4717820/04717835.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2007986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis: Mathematical Formulations and Solution Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis: Mathematical Formulations and Solution Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717835/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717835/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10361258","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis: Mathematical Formulations and Solution Techniques","sourcePdf":"tsmca-singh-2007986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097423S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4717820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4717820","articleId":"4717835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4717878,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Demirel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37338249900"},{"name":"Gholamreza Anbarjafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Anbarjafari","id":"37596451000"},{"name":"Mohammad N.

The singular value matrix represents the intensity information of the given image and any change on the singular values change the intensity of the input image. The proposed technique converts the image into the SVD domain and after normalizing the singular value matrix it reconstructs the image in the spatial domain by using the updated singular value matrix. The technique is called the singular value equalization (SVE) and compared with the standard grayscale histogram equalization (GHE) method. The visual and quantitative results suggest that the proposed SVE method clearly outperforms the GHE method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image equalization based on singular value decomposition","publicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","doi":"10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717878","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696050/4717848/04717878.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image equalization based on singular value decomposition","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717878/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424789","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image equalization based on singular value decomposition","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041801S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696050","isNumber":"4717848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696050","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4717848","articleId":"4717878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4717907,"authors":[{"name":"Tayfun Aytac","affiliation":["T\u00dcB\u0130TAK UEKAE/I-\u00d6LTAREN, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tayfun","lastName":"Aytac","id":"37329998500"},{"name":"Billur Barshan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Billur","lastName":"Barshan","id":"37328631300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2880-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2881-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4717907","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4717907","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Infrared sensors","Artificial neural networks","Geometry","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Indoor environments","Solid modeling","Neural networks","Aluminum","Packaging","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","infrared imaging","neural nets","optical sensors","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target classification","artificial neural networks","low-cost infrared sensors","intensity measurements","localization process","angular intensity scans","styrofoam packaging material","surface materials","IR sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717907","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696050/4717848/04717907.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target classification with simple infrared sensors using artificial neural networks","abstract":"This study investigates the use of low-cost infrared (IR) sensors for the determination of geometry and surface properties of commonly encountered features or targets in indoor environments, such as planes, corners, edges, and cylinders using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The intensity measurements obtained from such sensors are highly dependent on the location, geometry, and surface properties of the reflecting target in a way which cannot be represented by a simple analytical relationship, therefore complicating the localization and classification process. We propose the use of angular intensity scans and feature vectors obtained by modeling of angular intensity scans and present two different neural network based approaches in order to classify the geometry and/or the surface type of the targets. In the first case, where planes, 90deg corners, and 90deg edges covered with aluminum, white cloth, and Styrofoam packaging material are differentiated, an average correct classification rate of 78% of both geometry and surface over all target types is achieved. In the second case, where planes, 90deg edges, and cylinders covered with different surface materials are differentiated, an average correct classification rate of 99.5% is achieved. The method demonstrated shows that ANNs can be used to extract substantially more information than IR sensors are commonly employed for.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717907/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10424818","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4717907/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Target classification with simple infrared sensors using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target classification with simple infrared sensors using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0715S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696050","isNumber":"4717848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696050","xplore-issue":"4717848","articleId":"4717907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4717937,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, this procedure is expensive and difficult since destructive laboratory tests (DLT) are needed to be done. Therefore, the results of non-destructive laboratory tests (NDLT) combined with different features that are extracted by using image processing techniques can be used instead of DLT to predict UCS of BRS. The goal of this study is to predict the results of DLT by using the results of NDLT, extracted features and artificial neural networks (ANN). Unfortunately, having enough number of specimens for training of ANN is often impossible since the preparation of the standard BRS is extraordinarily difficult. Hence, it is very important to use a learning methodology that prevents deficient evaluation practices. Therefore, different well-known learning methodologies are tested to train the ANN. Then, their effects on error estimation for our small size sample set of BRS are evaluated. The results of simulations show the importance of learning strategies for accurate evaluation of an ANN with a low error rate in prediction of UCS of BRS.","publicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 23rd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696050/4717848/04717937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717937","doi":"10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Uniaxial Compressive Strengths of Brecciated Rock Specimens using neural networks and different learning models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Uniaxial Compressive Strengths of Brecciated Rock Specimens using neural networks and different learning models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4717937/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4717937/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10424848","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Uniaxial Compressive Strengths of Brecciated Rock Specimens using neural networks and different learning models","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"SPI-12092008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059062S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696050","isNumber":"4717848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696050","xplore-issue":"4717848","articleId":"4717937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4717977,"authors":[{"name":"Eun Yong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eun Yong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37877504800"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joohwan","lastName":"Chun","id":"37272877200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4717977","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Downlink","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Base stations","Throughput","Broadcasting","Signal to noise ratio","Region 9"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated beamforming","reduced overhead","multiuser MIMO system downlink","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","pilot overhead","orthogonal property","space division multiplexing","broadcast channel","broadcast channel"]},{"kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser communication, coordinated beamforming","space division multiplexing, broadcast channel"]}],"abstract":"We consider the coordinated beamforming for the downlink of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

The network channels are modeled as independent, non-identical, Rayleigh distributed coefficients. The exact symbol error rate is derived using the moment generating function (MGF). We derive the probability density function and MGF of the total SNR. Then, the MGF is used to determine the symbol error rate (SER). The diversity order of the amplify-and-forward cooperation with partial statistical channel state information is also found via the asymptotic behavior of the average SER, and it is shown that the cooperative network achieves full diversity.

It is well known that the MLFMA cannot be used for LF interactions, since it suffers from numerical instability. Contrary to current techniques, the proposed technique is not based on the spectral representation of the Green function. Instead the addition theorem of the MLFMA is manipulated into a form that allows numerically stable translations along the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z</i>\n axis. The translation operator for these translations is derived in closed form. A QR-based method is devised to allow stable translations in all the other directions. Interpolations and anterpolations are also provided, allowing a full multilevel algorithm. Since the NSPWMLFMA is based on the same mathematical foundations as the MLFMA, it requires limited adaptations to existing MLFMA codes. The fact that a QR is needed limits this algorithm to LF interactions. However, a coupling with the MLFMA is straightforward, allowing the easy construction of a broadband algorithm. The DC limit of the algorithm is also presented and it is shown that the algorithm remains valid for static problems. Finally, it is shown that the error introduced in the different steps of the algorithm is controllable, and a single-level vectorial version of the algorithm is applied to a generic scattering application to demonstrate its validity.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2007356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4717995/04718003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2007356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717995","startPage":"3752","endPage":"3767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nondirective Plane Wave MLFMA Stable at Low Frequencies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4718003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Nondirective Plane Wave MLFMA Stable at Low Frequencies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4718003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444643","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4718003/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nondirective Plane Wave MLFMA Stable at Low Frequencies","sourcePdf":"56tap12-ibogaert-2007356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178503S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4717995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4717995","articleId":"4718003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4718004,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob C.

A stable low cross polarization level of -20 dB is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2007377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4717995/04718011.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2007377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717995","startPage":"3645","endPage":"3649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Dual-Polarized Microstrip Patch Excited by Hook Shaped Probes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4718011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Dual-Polarized Microstrip Patch Excited by Hook Shaped Probes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4718011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10417076","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4718011/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Dual-Polarized Microstrip Patch Excited by Hook Shaped Probes","sourcePdf":"56tap12-kryu-2007377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058314S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4717995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4717995","articleId":"4718011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4718012,"authors":[{"name":"Takaoki Ikeda","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4717995/4718012/4718012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takaoki Ikeda was born in Shiga, Japan, on February 14, 1983.

The antenna has a simple metal pattern comprising a folded loop strip and a tuning pad, and is especially suited for application in small-size mobile phones (groundplane length 60 mm only) for multiband operation. The metal pattern is attached on the surfaces of a foam base, and the first three resonant loop modes (0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-wavelength modes) of the antenna can be excited with good impedance matching by simply adjusting proper dimensions of the tuning pad and its location along the folded loop strip. The excited 0.5-wavelength mode forms as the antenna's lower band at about 900 MHz for GSM operation, while the 1.0- and 1.5-wavelength modes are formed into a wide operating band at about 1900 MHz for the antenna's upper band to cover DCS/PCS/UMTS operation.

This phased array system scans plusmn2.8\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deg</sup>\n in azimuth and plusmn20\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deg</sup>\n in elevation with less than 3 dB scanning loss. The main objective of this design is to develop a Ku-band phased array system with very low cost components and a minimum number of tracking sensors. A novel beamforming algorithm compensates for the fabrication inaccuracies of the microwave components and variations in their characteristics due to ambient changes.

In the network, we first connect two transmission lines (TLs) individually to the input ports of two strongly coupled antennas. The length of the TLs is designed so that the trans-admittance between ports changes from a complex one at the antenna inputs to a pure imaginary one. A shunt reactive component is then attached in between the TL ends to cancel the resultant imaginary trans-admittance. Finally, a simple lumped-element circuit is added to each port for input impedance matching. The even-odd mode analysis is adopted to investigate the currents excited on the antennas for predicting the radiation pattern of the two-element antenna array. Two examples of printed antennas at 2.45 GHz are tackled by using the proposed decoupling structure. The measurement results agree quite well with the simulation ones. High antenna isolation and good input return loss are simultaneously achieved in both cases, which demonstrates the feasibility of the structure. The decoupled antenna array in each example radiates, as prediction, toward different but complementary directions when the input power is fed in turn to the two input ports. The array efficiency is estimated better than 75% in each example. This pattern diversity effect is helpful for reducing the channel correlation in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4717995/04718024.pdf","startPage":"3650","endPage":"3658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2005469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2005469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4718024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decoupling Technique for Increasing the Port Isolation Between Two Strongly Coupled Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Antenna arrays","MIMO","Power transmission lines","Transmission line antennas","Circuits","Impedance matching","Pattern analysis","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoupling technique","port isolation","coupled antennas","transmission lines","spaced antennas","shunt reactive component","lumped-element circuit","impedance matching","even-odd mode analysis","antenna radiation pattern","two-element antenna array","antenna isolation","multiple-input multiple-output communication system","MIMO communication system","pattern diversity effect","printed antennas","frequency 2.45 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling network","high isolation antennas","multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)","pattern diversity","wireless local area network (WLAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4718024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Decoupling Technique for Increasing the Port Isolation Between Two Strongly Coupled Antennas","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4718024/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10429017","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decoupling Technique for Increasing the Port Isolation Between Two Strongly Coupled Antennas","sourcePdf":"56tap11-schung-2005469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057232S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4717995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"4717995","articleId":"4718024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4718025,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It has a planar multiple-trapezoidal monopole with adjustable dimensions. The proposed antenna is incorporated with the rectangular/rounded-corner ground plane to further improve the monopole performances such as impedance bandwidth. The geometric complexity of the antenna configuration is not easily devisable when the UWB performance criteria such as low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), minimal antenna size, omni-directional and uniform radiation pattern, and relatively constant gain over the ultrawide frequency band are to be simultaneously met. In this paper, all of these requirements can now be easily accomplished by making use of the recently developed jumping genes (JGs) multiobjective optimization scheme. A vivid demonstration of this approach of UWB design is to select an antenna configuration from the thoroughly investigated results and come up with the ultimate recommendation of hardware prototype fabrication. This way not only confirms both the simulated and measured results are all in good agreement but also indicates that the proposed methodology is sound for the design of UWB antenna.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Ultra wideband antennas","Impedance","Bandwidth","Low voltage","Antenna radiation patterns","Performance gain","Frequency","Hardware","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","monopole antennas","optimisation","planar antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jumping genes multiobjective optimization scheme","planar monopole ultrawideband antenna","rectangular-rounded-corner ground plane","impedance bandwidth","geometric complexity","hardware prototype fabrication","trapezoidal monopole antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Jumping genes (JGs)","multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)","planar monopole antenna","trapezoidal monopole antenna","ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4718034","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2007288","startPage":"3659","endPage":"3666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4717995/04718034.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2007288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4718034/","displayDocTitle":"Jumping Genes Multiobjective Optimization Scheme for Planar Monopole Ultrawideband Antenna","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","volume":"56","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10429021","htmlLink":"/document/4718034/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jumping Genes Multiobjective Optimization Scheme for Planar Monopole Ultrawideband Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-yang-2007288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121517S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4717995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4717995","articleId":"4718034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4718038,"authors":[{"name":"Tzung-I Lee","affiliation":["Rayspan Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4717995/4718038/4718038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tzung-I Lee (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2008.","In 2002, he worked as a Research Assistant in NTU developing GUI for EM simulators.

The radiation impedances of the two modes are closely related to the coupling behavior of the 2-element array as a function of the antenna spacing. Through a multiport impedance matching network, the common and difference modes of the coupled antenna system can be separated into different driving ports. Conjugate match can thus be independently performed for each port, resulting in a fully matched 2-element array. Such a 2-element array with closely spaced antennas can potentially offer a significant array gain or an ideal 2 times 2 multiple input multiple output channel capacity. Full-wave simulations of a pair of half-wave dipoles with 0.1 lambda spacing have demonstrated the feasibility of the approach for narrowband applications. By combining the common mode and difference mode, approximately 3 times of the gain of a single half-wave dipole can be achieved. Experimental validation with a test bed consisting of two lambda/4 monopoles and a rat-race coupler has been carried out. The concept may be extended onto closely coupled antenna systems with different numbers of elements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode-Based Information Channels in Closely Coupled Dipole Pairs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2007379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4717995/04718038.pdf","startPage":"3804","endPage":"3811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2007379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4717995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4718038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4718038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Mode-Based Information Channels in Closely Coupled Dipole Pairs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4718038/","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10417086","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode-Based Information Channels in Closely Coupled Dipole Pairs","sourcePdf":"56tap12-ywang-2007379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122778S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4717995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4717995","articleId":"4718038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
