In HC systems, however, there is a possibility of machine and network failures and this can have an adverse impact on applications running on the system. In order to decrease the impact of failures on an application, matching and scheduling algorithms must be devised which minimize not only the execution time but also the failure probability of the application. However, because of the conflicting requirements, it is not possible to minimize both at the same time. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop matching and scheduling algorithms which account for both the execution time and the failure probability and can trade off execution time against the failure probability of the application. In order to attain these goals, a biobjective scheduling problem is first formulated and then two different algorithms, the biobjective dynamic level scheduling algorithm and the biobjective genetic algorithm, are developed. Unique to both algorithms is the expression used for computing the failure probability of an application with precedence constraints. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms can be used for producing task assignments where the execution time is weighed against the failure probability.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxh086","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8130002/08130009.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxh086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8130002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biobjective Scheduling Algorithms for Execution Time\u2013Reliability Trade-off in Heterogeneous Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Biobjective Scheduling Algorithms for Execution Time\u2013Reliability Trade-off in Heterogeneous Computing Systems","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biobjective Scheduling Algorithms for Execution Time\u2013Reliability Trade-off in Heterogeneous Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"bxh086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030849S","chronDate":"Jan.  2005","isNumber":"8130002","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"32","articleId":"8130009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130030,"authors":[{"name":"Cdric Lhoussaine","firstName":"Cdric","lastName":"Lhoussaine"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130030","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8130030","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/47.3.396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8130017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/47.3.396","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8130017/08130030.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review: The Pi-Calculus\u2014A Theory of Mobile Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2004","displayDocTitle":"Review: The Pi-Calculus\u2014A Theory of Mobile Processes","volume":"47","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2004","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130030/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review: The Pi-Calculus\u2014A Theory of Mobile Processes","sourcePdf":"470396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040713S","chronDate":"Jan.  2004","isNumber":"8130017","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","articleId":"8130030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130043,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Cairns","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cairns"},{"name":"Harold Thimbleby","firstName":"Harold","lastName":"Thimbleby"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130043","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["affordance","consistency","mode","symmetry","HCI"]}],"abstract":"Affordance is a widely used term in human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) that, while familiar and attractive, does not have a clear operational definition.

The proposed definition restricts symmetry-affordance to particular contexts but in doing so makes it more useful, as it is clear how to exploit symmetry to aid design. The definition is in standard mathematics (in fact, group theory and model theory) and requires little additional structure.

In addition to that, cloud computing is very complex by itself, because it encompasses numerous technologies and concepts. Apparently, overcoming these challenges requires substantial efforts from information security researchers to develop powerful mitigation solutions for this emerging problem. This entails developing a taxonomy of insider threats in cloud environments encompassing all potential abnormal activities in the cloud and can be useful for conducting security assessment. This article describes the first phase of an ongoing research to develop a framework for mitigating insider threats in cloud computing environments. Primarily, it presents a multidimensional taxonomy of insider threats in cloud computing and demonstrates its viability. The taxonomy provides a fundamental understanding for this complicated problem by identifying five dimensions; it also supports security engineers in identifying hidden paths, thus determining proper countermeasures, and presents a guidance that covers all bounders of insiders\u2019 threats issue\ue251in clouds; hence, it facilitates researchers\u2019 endeavours in tackling this problem. For instance, according to the hierarchical taxonomy, clearly many significant issues exist in public cloud, while conventional insider mitigation solutions can be used in private clouds.

One of the key trust modelling activities is trust prediction. During this process, the accuracy and reliability of the predicted trust values play an important role in the making of informed business decisions. Key factors to be considered at this stage are the variability and the high levels of distortion in the input series that have to be captured when predicting the trust values at a point in time in the future. In this paper, we propose a Multi-layer Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network to predict the future trust values of entities (services, agents, products etc.) for a future point in time based on data series input. We use four different non-uniform\u2019 data input series and measure the accuracy of the predicted values under different experimental scenarios for benchmarking and comparison with existing approaches. Results indicate that the model is reliable in predicting trust values even in scenarios where there are only limited data available on training the neural network and a high level of distortion is present in the input series.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network-Based Approach for Predicting Trust Values Based on Non-uniform Input in Mobile Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network-Based Approach for Predicting Trust Values Based on Non-uniform Input in Mobile Applications","sourcePdf":"bxr104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023921S","chronDate":"March  2012","isNumber":"8130318","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"5","articleId":"8130328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130448,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Huang","firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Duncan S.

It is built to be more efficient and secure, for example, supporting insider security, when compared with the conventional sign-then-encrypt approach. In this paper, we propose a new notion called heterogeneous signcryption in which the sender has an identity-based secret key while the receiver is holding a certificate-based public key pair. Heterogeneous signcryption is suitable for practical scenarios where an identity-based user, who does not have a personal certificate or a public key, wants to communicate securely with a server which has a certificate with its public key. We propose two constructions and show their security under the model we define in the random oracle model. The model we define captures the insider security for both confidentiality and unforgeability. Both of the schemes also support public verifiability and key privacy, that is, an adversary cannot find out who the sender and receiver are from a ciphertext in the insider security model. The second scheme is the most efficient one computationally among all key-privacy-preserving signcryption schemes even when compared with schemes in an identity-based cryptographic setting or certificate-based public key setting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr.  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr.  2011","publicationDate":"Apr. 2011","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Signcryption with Key Privacy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Signcryption with Key Privacy","sourcePdf":"bxq095.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018481S","chronDate":"Apr.  2011","isNumber":"8130438","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"12","articleId":"8130448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8130459,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Xi","firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Xi"},{"name":"Yan Tang","firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Tang"},{"name":"Jiankun Hu","firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Hu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Keystroke Verification Scheme for User Access Control in Cloud Computing Environment","abstract":"Cloud security is a major concern that may delay its widespread adoption. User access control (UAC) is the core component of security in cloud computing environment, aiming to ensure that stored data are allowed to be accessed only by authenticated/authorized users. As a typical behavioural biometrics, keystroke dynamics provides a promising UAC solution. The most challenging issue that hinders the wide deployment of keystroke is the high verification error rate. Gunetti et al. proposed a classical n-graph-based keystroke verification method (GP method), which can achieve a low False Acceptance Rate (FAR). However, the GP method suffers from a high False Rejection Rate (FRR) and a severe scalability issue. Thus, GP is not a feasible solution for computing cloud application where scalability is a big issue. In this paper, two keystroke verification approaches (nGdv-V and nGdv-C) are proposed to overcome GP's shortcomings. To reduce high FRR, we designed a new correlation measure using n-graph equivalent feature (nGdv) that enables more accurate recognition for genuine users. Moreover, correlation-based hierarchical clustering is proposed to address the scalability issue. The experimental results show that the nGdv-C can produce much lower FRR while achieving almost the same level of FAR as that of the GP method. Furthermore, 1250 times (when using nGdv-V) and three times (when using nGdv-C(17,4)) authentication speed gains have been achieved.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["keystroke dynamics","access control","biometric authentication","security","cloud computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8130459","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxr064","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1644","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8130453/08130459.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8130453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxr064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130459/","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Keystroke Verification Scheme for User Access Control in Cloud Computing Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Keystroke Verification Scheme for User Access Control in Cloud Computing Environment","sourcePdf":"bxr064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035533S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"8130453","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"20","articleId":"8130459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130579,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumar"},{"name":"Naveen Chilamkurti","firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Chilamkurti"},{"name":"Sherali Zeadally","firstName":"Sherali","lastName":"Zeadally"},{"name":"Young-Sik Jeong","firstName":"Young-Sik","lastName":"Jeong"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130579","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","job scheduling","quality of service","grid","performance"]}],"abstract":"In the past few years, cloud computing has emerged as a new reliable, scalable and flexible virtual computing environment (VCE). In this new VCE, users can use the available resources as a service by paying for that service according to the time for which these resources are used. It remains a significant challenge to achieve quality of service (QoS) in a VCE with the available resources. The main goal is to schedule the available resources so that the overall QoS delivered by the VCE can be improved. Resources are assumed to be located both at local and global sites. We propose a three-step scheme: resource selection, scheduling of users requests with shared resources and a new Resource Allocation and Adaptive Job Scheduling algorithm, which improves the QoS delivered by the cloud. For job scheduling, we define a new weight metric that is used to efficiently schedule jobs competing for available resources. Our proposed strategy increases the reliability of resource availability for a job and reduces the job completion time, which in turn increases the QoS delivered to end-users. We evaluate our proposed scheme using well-known heuristics. The results obtained show that our proposed scheme considerably reduces the job execution time, and increases the reliability of resource availability for job execution and throughput.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxt024","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8130572/08130579.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxt024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8130572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Quality of Service (QoS) Using Resource Allocation and Adaptive Scheduling in Cloud Computing with Grid Support","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8130579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130579/","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Quality of Service (QoS) Using Resource Allocation and Adaptive Scheduling in Cloud Computing with Grid Support","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Quality of Service (QoS) Using Resource Allocation and Adaptive Scheduling in Cloud Computing with Grid Support","sourcePdf":"bxt024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047718S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","isNumber":"8130572","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8130579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130697,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Liu","firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"ChuanKun Wu","firstName":"ChuanKun","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"XiJun Lin","firstName":"XiJun","lastName":"Lin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130697","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8130697","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information security","visual cryptography","threshold","concolorous"]}],"abstract":"Droste [CRYPTO\u201996] proposed a construction of threshold visual cryptography scheme (TVCS) under the visual cryptography model of Naor and Shamir, i.e. the visual cryptography model with the underlying operation OR.

In the RNN model, each neuron accumulates arriving signals and can fire if its potential at a given instant of time is strictly positive. Firing occurs at random, the intervals between successive firing instants following an exponential distribution of constant rate. When a neuron fires, it routes the generated pulses to the output lines in accordance with the connection probabilities. The number of neurons in the network is programmable and could be connected to each other with any desired neuron interconnection and this connection could be changed on the fly. The RNN chip architecture is cascadable to generate any network topology. All the parts of the RNN circuit are implemented using a standard digital Complimentary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxp036","startPage":"289","endPage":"303","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8130787/08130790.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxp036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8130787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cascadable Random Neural Network Chip with Reconfigurable Topology","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","random neural network (RNN)","hardware","architecture; digital integrated circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8130790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Cascadable Random Neural Network Chip with Reconfigurable Topology","volume":"53","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cascadable Random Neural Network Chip with Reconfigurable Topology","sourcePdf":"bxp036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029713S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"8130787","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8130790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8130901,"authors":[{"name":"Billur Barshan","firstName":"Billur","lastName":"Barshan"},{"name":"Murat Cihan Y\u00fcksek","firstName":"Murat Cihan","lastName":"Y\u00fcksek"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8130901","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inertial sensors","accelerometer","gyroscope","magnetometer","wearable sensors","body sensor networks","human activity classification","classifiers","cross validation","machine learning environments","WEKA","PRTools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8130901","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxt075","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","abstract":"This study provides a comparative assessment on the different techniques of classifying human activities performed while wearing inertial and magnetic sensor units on the chest, arms and legs.

A feature set extracted from the raw sensor data using principal component analysis is used for classification. Three different cross-validation techniques are employed to validate the classifiers. A performance comparison of the classifiers is provided in terms of their correct differentiation rates, confusion matrices and computational cost. The highest correct differentiation rates are achieved with ANNs (99.2%), SVMs (99.2%) and a GMM (99.1%). GMMs may be preferable because of their lower computational requirements. Regarding the position of sensor units on the body, those worn on the legs are the most informative. Comparing the different sensor modalities indicates that if only a single sensor type is used, the highest classification rates are achieved with magnetometers, followed by accelerometers and gyroscopes.

While palaeoclimatic variations, i.e. glacial/interglacial alternation periods, are known to be governed by insolation variations via orbital frequencies, the link between such frequencies and the geomagnetic field maintenance processes (convection and rotation in the fluid metallic core) remains unclear. The study of frequency behaviour of long time-series proxy records requires a robust and linear time-frequency method with local and scale analysis properties. For these reasons, we use algorithms based on complex continuous wavelet theory and the stationary phase method, first developed in acoustics in the years 1988\u20131991, for extracting frequency and amplitude modulation laws of arbitrary signals from the phase of their wavelet transform. This method is robust in the presence of noise and does not require restrictive conditions on the energy of signals.After introducing the basis of the method with some illustrations on periodic signals, we show the efficiency of our algorithms on a synthetic insolation signal (Milankovitch cycles), by extracting the main three orbital frequencies (precession, obliquity and eccentricity); then we show its robustness in the presence of a high level of noise. Finally, we apply this method to various proxy records of (i) past climate variations (\u03b4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">18</sup>\nO), (ii) the past geomagnetic field intensity variations recorded by ocean sediments and (iii) along the deep-seafloor basalts and (iv) variations of the production of cosmogenic nuclide (\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sup>\nBe/\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup>\nBe). Our results confirm the presence of orbital frequencies in all these palaeoproxy records and suggest an orbital forcing of geomagnetic field variations via geodynamo processes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.04057.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8131628/08131636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.04057.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8131628","startPage":"767","endPage":"781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of non-continuous orbital frequencies from noisy insolation data and from palaeoproxy records of geomagnetic intensity using the phase of continuous wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8131636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of non-continuous orbital frequencies from noisy insolation data and from palaeoproxy records of geomagnetic intensity using the phase of continuous wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8131636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"176","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of non-continuous orbital frequencies from noisy insolation data and from palaeoproxy records of geomagnetic intensity using the phase of continuous wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"1763767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031037S","chronDate":"March  2009","isNumber":"8131628","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8131636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8132183,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ajdari Rad","firstName":"Ali Ajdari","lastName":"Rad"},{"name":"Martin Hasler","firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hasler"},{"name":"Mahdi Jalili","firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Jalili"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1367-0751"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1368-9894"}],"articleNumber":"8132183","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8132183","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent Neural Networks","Reservoir Computing","Echo State Networks","Optimization","Kronecker Product"]}],"abstract":"Recurrent neural networks based on reservoir computing are increasingly being used in many applications. Optimization of the topological structure of the reservoir and the internal connection weights for a given task is one of the most important problems in reservoir computing. In this paper, considering the fact that one can construct a large matrix using Kronecker products of several small-size matrices, we propose a method to optimize the reservoir. Having a small number of parameters to optimize, a gradient based algorithm is applied to optimize parameters, and consequently the reservoir. In addition to reducing the number of parameters for optimization, potentially, the method is able to control several other properties of the reservoir such as spectral radius, sparsity, weight distribution and underlying connections, i.e. connection topology. To reveal the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, the application to the following tasks are considered: Nonlinear autoregressive moving average and multiple superimposed oscillators. Simulation results show satisfactory performance of the method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8132099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jigpal/jzp044","publicationTitle":"Logic Journal of the IGPL","displayPublicationTitle":"Logic Journal of the IGPL","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016810/8132099/08132183.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"685","doi":"10.1093/jigpal/jzp044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reservoir optimization in recurrent neural networks using properties of Kronecker product","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Reservoir optimization in recurrent neural networks using properties of Kronecker product","volume":"18","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8132183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reservoir optimization in recurrent neural networks using properties of Kronecker product","sourcePdf":"jzp044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045472S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"8132099","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016810","articleId":"8132183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8132644,"authors":[{"name":"Eric L.

Local newsworthy events, sports team victories or defeats, abnormal weather patterns and globally trending topics all influence the content of online discussion. The automated discovery of these underlying themes from corpora of text is of interest to numerous academic fields as well as to law enforcement organizations and commercial users. One useful class of tools to deal with such problems are topic models, which attempt to recover latent groups of word associations from the text. However, it is clear that these topics may also exhibit patterns in both time and space. The recovery of such patterns complements the analysis of the text itself and in many cases provides additional context. In this work we describe two methods for mining interesting spatio-temporal dynamics and relations among topics, one that compares the topic distributions as histograms in space and time and another that models topics over time as temporal or spatio-temporal Hawkes process with exponential trigger functions. Both methods may be used to discover topics with abnormal distributions in space and time. The second method also allows for self-exciting topics and can recover intertopic relationships (excitation or inhibition) in both time and space. We apply these methods to a geo-tagged Twitter dataset and provide analysis and discussion of the results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8132644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun.  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun.  2016","volume":"81","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jun. 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topic time series analysis of microblogs","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Topic time series analysis of microblogs","sourcePdf":"hxw025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040932S","chronDate":"Jun.  2016","isNumber":"8132642","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016796","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8132644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8132738,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Andrysiak","firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Andrysiak"},{"name":"\u0141ukasz Saganowski","firstName":"\u0141ukasz","lastName":"Saganowski"},{"name":"Micha\u0142 Chora\u015b","firstName":"Micha\u0142","lastName":"Chora\u015b"},{"name":"Rafa\u0142 Kozik","firstName":"Rafa\u0142","lastName":"Kozik"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1367-0751"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1368-9894"}],"articleNumber":"8132738","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network anomaly detection","cybersecurity","ARFIMA","A-FIGARH","MIDAS"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we present network anomaly detection system based on long memory statistical models.

SOMs provide a discretized representation of the input space to allow for more efficient processing and analysis. While neural networks have historically focused on the emulation of information processing by animal brains, analyzing the existing self-organizing paradigms has suggested that it could be possible to achieve quality results not only by emulating the human brain, but also by mimicking one of the fundamental forces of the universe\u2014gravity. This paper features an algorithm, GORMANN, which utilizes Newton's law of universal gravitation to attract neurons to input data. The gravitational attraction of the data on the neurons produces results that are analogous to a cross between a SOM and an image processed by morphological thinning: the key features of the input are extracted and discretized. This has the effect of maintaining a topology similar to the input pattern while ignoring superfluous information. Current research has utilized morphological thinning for a variety of fields such as micro-blood vessel detection and real-world map analysis. In this paper, GORMANN is compared with the Kohonen SOM and morphological thinning on a number of 2D input patterns. We will show that GORMANN produces excellent results in very few iterations.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxv069","startPage":"875","endPage":"888","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8139340/08139343.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxv069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8139340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GORMANN: Gravitationally Organized Related Mapping Artificial Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["self-organizing maps","neural network architectures","gravity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8139343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"GORMANN: Gravitationally Organized Related Mapping Artificial Neural Network","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GORMANN: Gravitationally Organized Related Mapping Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"bxv069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022696S","chronDate":"June  2016","isNumber":"8139340","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8139343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8139451,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory A.

Finite difference methods are used to compute predicted data efficiently and objective functional gradients. Only six forward modelling applications per frequency are typically required to produce the model update at each iteration. This efficiency is achieved by incorporating a simple line search procedure that calls for a sufficient reduction in the objective functional, instead of an exact determination of its minimum along a given descent direction. Additional efficiencies in the scheme are sought by incorporating preconditioning to accelerate solution convergence. Even with these efficiencies, the solution\u2019s realism and complexity are still limited by the speed and memory of serial processors. To overcome this barrier, the scheme has been implemented on a parallel computing platform where tens to thousands of processors operate on the problem simultaneously. The inversion scheme is tested by inverting data produced with a forward modelling code algorithmically different from that employed in the inversion algorithm. This check provides independent verification of the scheme since the two forward modelling algorithms are prone to different types of numerical error.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00007.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","startPage":"410","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00007.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8139439","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8139439/08139451.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D magnetotelluric modelling","inversion","non-linear conjugate gradients","preconditioning."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional magnetotelluric inversion using non-linear conjugate gradients","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8139451/","volume":"140","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional magnetotelluric inversion using non-linear conjugate gradients","sourcePdf":"1402410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044744S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"8139439","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8139451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":8139539,"authors":[{"name":"Vjacheslav Spichak","firstName":"Vjacheslav","lastName":"Spichak"},{"name":"Irina Popova","firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Popova"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8139539","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8139539","abstract":"The possibility of solving the three-dimensional (3-D) inverse problem of geoelectrics using the artificial neural network (ANN) approach is investigated. The properties of a supervised ANN based on the back-propagation scheme with three layers of neurons are studied, and the ANN architecture is adjusted.A model class consisting of a dipping dyke in the basement of a two-layer earth with the dyke in contact with the overburden is used for numerical experiments. Six macroparameters of the 3-D model, namely the thickness of the top layer, which coincides with the depth of the dyke (D), the conductivity ratio between the first and second layers (C\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n\u200a/C\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n\u200a), the conductivity contrast of the dyke (C/C\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n\u200a), and the width (W ), length (L ) and dip angle of the dyke (A), are used.Various groups of magnetotelluric field components and their transformations are studied in order to estimate the effect of the data type used on the ANN recognition ability. It is found that use of only the xy- and yx-components of impedance phases results in reasonable recognition errors for all unknown parameters (D: 0.02 per cent, C1/C2: 8.4 per cent, C/C2: 26.8 per cent, W : 0.02 per cent, L : 0.02 per cent, A: 0.24 per cent).The influence of the size and shape of the training data pool (including the \u2018gaps in education\u2019 and \u2018no target\u2019 effects) on the recognition properties is studied. Results from numerous ANN tests demonstrate that the ANN possesses good enough interpolation and extrapolation abilities if the training data pool contains a sufficient number of representative data sets.The effect of noise is estimated by means of mixing the synthetic data with 30, 50 and 100 per cent Gaussian noise. The unusual behaviour of the recognition errors for some of the model parameters when the data become more noisy (in particular, the fact that an increase in error is followed by a decrease) indicates that the use of standard techniques of noise reduction may give an opposite result, so the development of a special noise treatment methodology is required.Thus, it is shown that ANN-based recognition can be successfully used for inversion if the data correspond to the model class familiar to the ANN. No initial guess regarding the parameters of the 3-D target or 1-D layering is required. The ability of the ANN to teach itself using real geophysical (not only electromagnetic) data measured at a given location over a sufficiently long period means that there is the potential to use this approach for interpreting monitoring data.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00065.x","startPage":"15","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8139536/08139539.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00065.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8139536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network inversion of magnetotelluric data in terms of three-dimensional earth macroparameters","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D inversion","dyke","magnetotellurics","neural network."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8139539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2000","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network inversion of magnetotelluric data in terms of three-dimensional earth macroparameters","volume":"142","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2000","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network inversion of magnetotelluric data in terms of three-dimensional earth macroparameters","sourcePdf":"142115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024536S","chronDate":"July  2000","isNumber":"8139536","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8139539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":8139864,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2\u20133 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.1999.00746.x","startPage":"477","endPage":"491","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246X.1999.00746.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8139849","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8139849/08139864.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inferring the lithology of borehole rocks by applying neural network classifiers to downhole logs: an example from the Ocean Drilling Program","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8139864/","displayDocTitle":"Inferring the lithology of borehole rocks by applying neural network classifiers to downhole logs: an example from the Ocean Drilling Program","volume":"136","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inferring the lithology of borehole rocks by applying neural network classifiers to downhole logs: an example from the Ocean Drilling Program","sourcePdf":"1362477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028007S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"8139849","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"6","articleId":"8139864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8139895,"authors":[{"name":"Theo Ungerer","firstName":"Theo","lastName":"Ungerer"},{"name":"Borut Robi\u010d","firstName":"Borut","lastName":"Robi\u010d"},{"name":"Jurij \u0160ilc","firstName":"Jurij","lastName":"\u0160ilc"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8139895","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8139895","abstract":"The instruction-level parallelism found in a conventional instruction stream is limited.

The chip multiprocessor integrates two or more complete processors on a single chip. Every unit of a processor is duplicated and used independently of its copies on the chip. In contrast, the multithreaded processor is able to pursue two or more threads of control in parallel within the processor pipeline. Unused instruction slots, which arise from pipelined execution of single-threaded programs by a contemporary microprocessor, are filled by instructions of other threads within a multithreaded processor. The execution units are multiplexed between the threads in the register sets. Underutilization of a superscalar processor due to missing instruction-level parallelism can be overcome by simultaneous multithreading, where a processor can issue multiple instructions from multiple threads each cycle. Simultaneous multithreaded processors combine the multithreading technique with a wide-issue superscalar processor such that the full issue bandwidth is utilized by potentially issuing instructions from different threads simultaneously. This survey paper explains and classifies the various multithreading techniques in research and in commercial microprocessors and compares multithreaded processors with chip multiprocessors.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/45.3.320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/45.3.320","startPage":"320","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8139888/08139895.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8139888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multithreaded Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8139895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Multithreaded Processors","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multithreaded Processors","sourcePdf":"450320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031198S","chronDate":"Jan.  2002","isNumber":"8139888","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"15","articleId":"8139895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"}]
