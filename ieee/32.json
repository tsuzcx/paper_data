Three neural-net methods to identify the nearest codevector have been proposed in this paper. Method I is based on the property that a perceptron separates the Euclidean space linearly into two half-spaces. Thus, for a codebook with N codevectors, N(N-1)/2 perceptrons combined with N logical AND gates can completely identify the nearest codevector. An efficient algorithm to detect redundant perceptrons has also been developed. Method II uses this efficient algorithm to identify all redundant perceptrons that can be removed from the neural network in Method I. Method III uses a backpropagation neural network combined with a limited exhaustive full search process within a small size neighboring codevector set to finally identify the nearest codevector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1993.320130","pdfPath":"/iel2/1063/7690/00320130.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"786 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON '93.

One higher level neural network which makes use of some outputs from lower level as its inputs is used to diagnose the faults in transmission lines. A combined gradient learning algorithm with advantages of both gradient and conjugate gradient algorithms is employed for training the neural networks. This learning algorithm converges faster than the error back propagation algorithm.

Specifically, the effect of the backpropagation parameters on the convergence and stability of the network have been investigated. The neural network is configured as a feedforward inverse controller. Results indicated that increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer will improve the convergence speed. However, beyond a certain limit additional neurons will cause system oscillations and finally instability. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a relationship between the rms error and the number of iterations used in the training of the neural network. Guidelines for selecting the neural network parameters are also given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robot control","Convergence","Neurons","Application software","Computer simulation","Performance analysis","Control system synthesis","Backpropagation","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","convergence","neurocontrollers","backpropagation","feedforward"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network controller","learning behaviour","robotic control system","backpropagation parameters","convergence","stability","feedforward inverse controller","oscillations","instability","rms error"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00320480.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1993.320480","startPage":"252","endPage":"256 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON '93.

The box-counting method was used initially with two variations: fixed grid method and dynamic grid method. With the inherent difficulties in box-counting such as integral values of box sizes, we later investigated the variation method and the correlation method. However, the above methods depended on the segmentation result which separated a mole from its surrounding skin. In order to overcome the problem, we had experimented with two different methods which manipulated the intensities around the border of a mole. The first one calculated the size of the intensity surface area at different scales and the second method used the average absolute intensity difference of pixel pairs to obtain normalized fractional feature vectors. The paper reports the different ways of calculating the fractal dimensions and compares their differentiation power in the use of diagnosis of melanoma images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1993.320544","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON '93.

The frequency domain and time domain calculation methods for stability assessment are time consuming, therefore, neither one is suitable for the purpose. ANNs have recently been proposed as an alternative method for solving certain traditional problems in power systems where conventional techniques have not achieved the desired speed, accuracy or efficiency. The application areas of ANNs are mainly regression, classification and combinatorial optimization. Using ANNs to assess power system transient stability is a classification problem. An ANN needs quite a long time for offline training, however, having been trained, it needs only a very short time to make a classification for a problem. Here, the authors describe how a multilayer feedforward ANN is suitable for the online transient stability assessment of power systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1993.320592","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00320592.png","startPage":"91","endPage":"94 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON '93.

A multi-level approach seems to be best suited for implementing a high voltage conversion system because it leads to harmonic reduction and safely deals with a high power conversion system independent of the dynamic switching characteristics of each power semiconductor device. However, a conventional multi-level inverter has some problems; voltage unbalance between DC-link capacitors, and overvoltages across the inner switching devices. Therefore, the authors propose a novel structure of a multi-level inverter for improving these problems.

In addition, results obtained using a fuzzy controller for the learning rate suggest a significant potential for speeding up the training process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320735/","accessionNumber":"4759567","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-5 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decision surface modeling of textile spinning operations using neural network technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision surface modeling of textile spinning operations using neural network technology","confLoc":"Greenville, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"00320735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031285S","chronDate":"4-5 May 1994","isNumber":"7694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1108","citationCount":"3","articleId":"320735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":320744,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT's) were found to have very low intermodulation distortion in power operation. Two-tone tests were carried out on both common-emitter (CE) and common-base (CB) power HBT's. At 7 GHz, the CE HBT showed -20 dBc IM/sub 3/ (third-order intermodulation ratio) and 12% power added efficiency (PAE) per tone at the 1 dB gain compression point; IM/sub 3/ dropped to -30 dBc at 1.5 dB output power backoff. The CE HBT has lower intermodulation distortion than CB HBT. Load pull data were collected to aid the understanding of the intermodulation. Parameters of the Gummel-Poon model (as used in SPICE) were derived for HBT's based on dc data and small-signal S parameters at various bias points. The accuracy and validity of the model were confirmed by comparison to experimental two-tone results. SPICE predicts that the emitter and base resistances linearize the HBT and reduce the third-order intermodulation distortion. The excellent third-order intermodulation performance of the CE HBT makes it a very attractive choice for linear power amplifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7696/00320763.pdf","startPage":"1845","endPage":"1850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.320763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.320763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=320763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AlGaAs/GaAs HBT linearity characteristics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Linearity","Intermodulation distortion","SPICE","High power amplifiers","Testing","Gain","Power generation","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","heterojunction bipolar transistors","power transistors","solid-state microwave devices","microwave amplifiers","power amplifiers","intermodulation","semiconductor device models","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AlGaAs/GaAs","HBT","linearity characteristics","linear power amplifiers","intermodulation distortion","two-tone tests","common-emitter configuration","common-base configuration","power added efficiency","Gummel-Poon model","small-signal S parameters","third-order intermodulation performance","7 GHz","12 percent","AlGaAs-GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"AlGaAs/GaAs HBT linearity characteristics","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797442","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AlGaAs/GaAs HBT linearity characteristics","sourcePdf":"00320763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058562S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"320763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":320766,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

The receiver is integrated on a single chip, and is based on a 23 GHz local oscillator driving four separate phase-coherent 94 GHz subharmonic mixers. The resulting IF signals are takeoff-chip to a IF monopulse processor, which produces sum and difference monopulse patterns for the elevation and azimuth coordinates. Voltage-controlled phase-shifters in each of the IF channels allow the monopulse patterns to be electronically steered. All of the receiver circuits are realized using uniplanar coplanar-waveguide (CPW), slot lines and coplanar striplines (CPS). These features result in a compact, low-cost system suitable for tracking systems operating in poor visibility conditions, as well as in collision avoidance receivers for automotive applications. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a fully integrated millimeter-wave subsystem to date.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.320766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7696/00320766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.320766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7696","startPage":"1863","endPage":"1871","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00320766.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 94 GHz planar monopulse tracking receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=320766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 94 GHz planar monopulse tracking receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 94 GHz planar monopulse tracking receiver","sourcePdf":"00320766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050405S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"320766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":320783,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The reason for this is because the algorithm is based on the leap-frog formula. In this paper, both linear and nonlinear predictors, which are widely used in signal processing, are introduced to reduce the computation time of the FD-TD algorithm. A short segment of an FD-TD record is used to train the predictor. As long as the predictor is set up properly, an accurate future realization can be obtained. We demonstrate, by means of numerical results, that the efficiency of the FD-TD method can be improved by up to 90%. With this result, the FD-TD algorithm becomes a much more attractive technique for solving electromagnetic problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

By using the tendon as a force transmission mechanism, compact design of the robot hand is achieved with the developed controller. Problems specific to the tendon characteristics are considered, such as the slacking problem of tendons when the joint is disturbed, and the tendon elongation problem when the collocated position sensing method is used for compact design. To cope with these problems, two fundamental algorithms are developed and implemented on a laboratory apparatus, the POSTECH Hand II. First, a position estimation algorithm is developed to evaluate the accurate position of the hand, leading to an antagonistic tendon controller. Secondly, an active stiffness control algorithm is developed to control the fingertip force. It is shown that the finger produces excellent linear stiffness characteristics which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The object stiffness control is also implemented to exert desired force to the environment when the hand grasps an object, and is evaluated via experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.320882","startPage":"10","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.320882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7698","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/7698/00320882.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stiffness control of a coupled tendon-driven robot hand","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320882/","displayDocTitle":"Stiffness control of a coupled tendon-driven robot hand","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4796434","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stiffness control of a coupled tendon-driven robot hand","sourcePdf":"00320882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05526S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"57","articleId":"320882","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":320883,"authors":[{"name":"B.

To use acceleration signals there are at least two approaches: direct use in a feedback loop to improve the tracking error, and indirect use by an observer to improve the estimates of position and speed. Several proposals for the use of the acceleration in a feedback loop, resulting in slightly different controllers, are discussed. The design of the controllers for the experimental system, a flexible multiple degrees-of-freedom XY-table, uses a simplified two degrees-of-freedom model. The observer is of the predictive type to compensate for the time delay in the implementation, and its design is based in part on Kalman filter theory. Simulations and experiments show that both acceleration feedback and an acceleration assisted observer can improve the performance of the control system, but the robustness does not change significantly. A combination of both approaches did not give any improvement in the experiments, but some in the simulations. Disturbances in the acceleration signal (especially motor torque ripple), phase lag introduced by the signal processing equipment, time delay caused by the sampled data implementation of the controller and observer, and the non-colocated position and acceleration sensors are believed to be limitations for the usefulness of the acceleration signal. A performance improvement up to a factor of 1.5 was possible in the author's application, so to consider the use of acceleration measurements in tracking control is recommended.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4796435","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration assisted tracking control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration assisted tracking control","sourcePdf":"00320883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052956S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"40","articleId":"320883","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":320940,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

A theoretical model, based on the steady-state equations of the lasing condition in a Fabry-Perot type laser cavity, is described, and through it a satisfactory analysis of self-mixing interference for optical sensing applications is given. In this work, the self-mixing interference produced by an external optical feedback is found to be due to the variations in the threshold gain and in the spectral distribution of the laser output. The gain variation results in an optical intensity modulation, and the spectral variation determines both the modulation waveform and the coherence properties of the interference. The theoretical analysis of the self-mixing interference is seen to yield a simulation of the laser power modulation which is in good agreement with the experiment results reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.320940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.320940","endPage":"1587","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00320940.png","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7699/00320940.pdf","startPage":"1577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-mixing interference inside a single-mode diode laser for optical sensing applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320940/","displayDocTitle":"Self-mixing interference inside a single-mode diode laser for optical sensing applications","volume":"12","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4802300","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-mixing interference inside a single-mode diode laser for optical sensing applications","sourcePdf":"00320940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054442S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"214","articleId":"320940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":320941,"authors":[{"name":"L.

These devices include an electro-optic polarization modulator, an integrated amplitude modulator consisting of a polarization modulator and an on-chip polarizer, and an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4802301","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Rapid direct fabrication of active electro-optic modulators in GaAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid direct fabrication of active electro-optic modulators in GaAs","sourcePdf":"00320941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069114S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","articleId":"320941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":320945,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The NSIS realizes all-optical signal regeneration, including timing and amplitude regularizing, by switching clock pulses with amplified input signals using a walk-off-induced, wide, square switching window and intensity-dependent transmittance of the device. First, characteristics (in both the temporal and spectral domains) of the all-optical signal regeneration achieved with the NSIS are investigated theoretically and experimentally. They certify that if clock pulses are within the square switching window obtained with signal-clock walk-off, the clock pulses can be modulated according to the data that the input signals carry and retain their temporal and spectral profiles. This means that if clock pulses can be prepared that meet the system requirements, the NSIS can convert input signals that may not satisfy system requirements into high-quality output signals. Limitations on the switching contrast due to the cross-phase modulation of counterpropagating reference pulses is also discussed. Second, two possible applications of NSIS-based all-optical signal regularizing/regeneration, 1) an all-optical multiplexer with an optical clock and 2) an all-optical regenerative repeater, are discussed. Preliminary experiments with /spl sim/10-ps pulses at bit rates of /spl sim/5 Gb/s that use locally prepared optical clock pulses, show that the NSIS provides an error-free regeneration function with a certain tolerance for pulse-period irregularity if a proper optical clock is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.320949","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7699/00320949.pdf","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.320949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7699","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=320949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All optical signal regularizing/regeneration using a nonlinear fiber Sagnac interferometer switch with signal-clock walk-off","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"All optical signal regularizing/regeneration using a nonlinear fiber Sagnac interferometer switch with signal-clock walk-off","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/320949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","volume":"12","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4802308","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All optical signal regularizing/regeneration using a nonlinear fiber Sagnac interferometer switch with signal-clock walk-off","sourcePdf":"00320949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066597S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"50","articleId":"320949","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":320980,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the proposed scheme, the pole placements of the state observer and the disturbance observer are chosen separately. When the two observers employed the same pole placements, the experimental setup had a tendency to become unstable due to the detection error. By selection of the different pole placements, the disturbance observer quickly estimates the disturbance and feedforward disturbance cancellation is achieved. Then the state observer estimates the state variables at the next sampling instant, and the deadbeat controller is applied to the nominal system. This scheme has advantages in robustness in the practical application. From the view point of UPS applications, the advantages and disadvantages are discussed through simulations and experiments.

When the azimuth FM rate parameter is range invariant, the deramp function is linear frequency modulated. In practice, this parameter is a function of range.

The purpose of the proposed approach is to exploit neural networks advantages while solving, in the context of the considered application, the problems of \"architecture definition\" and of \"opacity\". The architecture of the proposed neural networks reflects the provenance of data from different sensors. This allows one to easily define a network architecture by exploiting the characteristics of a given multisensor classification problem. In addition, the \"structuring\" of the architecture notably helps to understand the classification criteria implemented by the neural network classifier. To make possible such an interpretation, a transformation of the representation of original networks into a \"simplified representation\" has also been defined. The advantages provided by such networks are pointed out from the viewpoint of the remote-sensing application. Experimental results on multisensor data and comparisons with the Bayesian classifier are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322191","pdfPath":"/iel2/1064/7705/00322191.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"909 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '93 - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '93 - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured neural networks for the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Structured neural networks for the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4740884","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured neural networks for the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00322191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038996S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","isNumber":"7705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1064","citationCount":"3","articleId":"322191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":322194,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The test site, located near Taoyuan county of the northern Taiwan, is an agriculture area containing small ponds, bare and barren soils, vegetation, built-up land, near shore sea, and man-made buildings. The classifier is a dynamic learning neural network (DL) using the Kalman filter technique as an adaptation rule. The network architecture involves multi-layer perceptrons, i.e., feed-forward nets with one or more layers of nodes between the input and output nodes. The methodology of selection of training data sets is addressed. Then, accordingly, selected data sets from a 512/spl times/512 pixels three-band image are used to train the neural nets to categorize different types of the land-cover. Both simulated and real images are used to test the classification performance. Results indicate that the DL substantially reduces the training time as compared to the commonly used back-propagation (BP) trained neural network whose slow training process is shown to impede it in certain practical applications. As for classification accuracy, the presented results are shown to be excellent. It is concluded that the use of a dynamic learning network gives very promising classification results in terms of training time and classification accuracy. In particular, the proposed network significantly improves the practicality of the land-cover classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322194/","accessionNumber":"4740881","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification of multispectral imagery using dynamic learning neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of multispectral imagery using dynamic learning neural network","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00322194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038283S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","isNumber":"7705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1064","citationCount":"2","articleId":"322194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":322233,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

In this paper, they apply the NN approach to the classification of multi-temporal LANDSAT TM images in order to investigate the robustness of a normalization method. From their experiments, they confirmed that the NN approach with the preprocessing is more effective for the classification than the original NN approach even if the test data, is taken at the different time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322235","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00322235.png","startPage":"716","endPage":"718 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '93 - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1064/7705/00322235.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IGARSS '93 - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural network approach to classify multi-temporal Landsat images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Satellites","Remote sensing","Application software","Pixel","Signal processing","Statistical analysis","Robustness","Testing","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","geophysical techniques","neural nets","image recognition","geophysics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image recognition","computing method","land surface remote sensing","measurement technique","neural network","classify multi-temporal Landsat image","optical visible","multispectral","model","image classification","normalization method","preprocessing","processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural network approach to classify multi-temporal Landsat images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4740840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural network approach to classify multi-temporal Landsat images","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00322235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026447S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug 1993","isNumber":"7705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1064","citationCount":"1","articleId":"322235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":322236,"authors":[{"name":"Houqiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Radio and Electronics, University of Science and Technology, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Houqiang Li","id":"37087429224"},{"name":"Zhengkai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Radio and Electronics, University of Science and Technology, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Zhengkai Liu","id":"37087276170"},{"name":"Weidong Sun","affiliation":["Department of Radio and Electronics, University of Science and Technology, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Weidong Sun","id":"37087581518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1240-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"322236","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=322236","abstract":"The performance is analyzed of Multilayered Neural Networks (MLNs) and its training rule-back propagation (BP) algorithm.

Correlations were calculated between the different plant- and soil-parameters and the averaged backscatter from the fields under investigation. A high correlation coefficient of 0.8 was achieved between soil moisture and the grey-values of the test fields in the radar image.

A second neural network is then trained using only pixels for which the two classifiers did not initially agree. This second network is thus trained specifically to discriminate ambiguous pixels.

For comparison, we also studied the light yield of a Gd/sub 2/SiO/sub 5/:Ce/sup 3+/ crystal and a CsI:Tl crystal as a function of excitation energy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.322780","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7706/00322780.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.322780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"735","endPage":"737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear response in the scintillation yield of Lu/sub 2/SiO/sub 5/:Ce/sup 3+/","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=322780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear response in the scintillation yield of Lu/sub 2/SiO/sub 5/:Ce/sup 3+/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322780/","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4780887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear response in the scintillation yield of Lu/sub 2/SiO/sub 5/:Ce/sup 3+/","sourcePdf":"00322780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053088S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"77","articleId":"322780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":322789,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In addition, a tail is observed extending beyond 700 nm. Optical irradiation into this tail (PSL) or heating of the crystal (TL) results in Ce/sup 3+/ emission. It is shown that both PSL and TL are due to the same traps: In addition, an anti-correlation is found between the light output under gamma-ray irradiation and the trap concentration in the crystal. The nature of the recombination centers responsible for the low light output in some crystals is not clear.

This is the first iteration of the production analog IC for the SDC silicon tracker. The IC is laid out to directly match the 50 /spl mu/m pitch double-sided silicon strip detector. The chip measures 6.8 mm/spl times/3.1 mm and contains 3,600 transistors. Three stages of amplification provide 180 mV/fC of gain with a 35 nsec peaking time at the comparator input. For a 14 pF detector capacitance, the equivalent noise charge is 1300 el. RMS at a power consumption of 1 mW/channel from a single 3.5 V supply. With the discriminator threshold set to 4 times the noise level, a 16 nsec time-walk for 1.25 to 10 fC signals is achieved using a time-walk compensation network.

This study estimates the maximum number of BGO crystals which can be coupled to a photomultiplier and be decoded with this design, based on the number of photoelectrons generated and the optical efficiency of the crystal-phototube combination. From photoelectron statistics, a 10/spl times/10 BGO array can be coupled to a single square phototube (Hamamatsu R-2497) and have each crystal clearly decoded. Simulation of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional statistical photoelectron distribution verifies the estimations. The simulation also yields the optimal distribution of light to the decoding phototubes. This theoretically optimal light distribution is used to guide the development of an 8/spl times/8 array of 3.2/spl times/3.2 mm BGO crystals (10 mm deep) using Hamamatsu R-2497 phototubes. All 64 crystals in the array can be clearly identified. The reconstructed image resolution is further estimated for the 8/spl times/8 and 10/spl times/10 arrays. These resolution results are also compared to discrete detectors which do not use analog decoding. The comparison shows that the analog decoding process degrades the image resolution by 7 to 9%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.322918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"1453","endPage":"1457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7706/00322918.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00322918.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.322918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-dimensional detector decoding study on BGO arrays with quadrant sharing photomultipliers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Sensor arrays","Photoelectricity","Crystals","Solid scintillation detectors","Optical design","Image resolution","Estimation theory","Positrons","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","radioisotope scanning and imaging","computerised tomography","cameras","photomultipliers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D detector decoding study","BGO arrays","quadrant sharing photomultipliers","positron camera detector design","phototubes quadrant sharing","photoelectrons generation","optimal light distribution","crystal-phototube combination optical efficiency","reconstructed image resolution","analog decoding","analog decoding process","nuclear medicine","medical instrumentation","10 mm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A 2-dimensional detector decoding study on BGO arrays with quadrant sharing photomultipliers","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4780946","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322918/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-dimensional detector decoding study on BGO arrays with quadrant sharing photomultipliers","sourcePdf":"00322918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046653S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"96","articleId":"322918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":322926,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Each photodiode is coupled to one end of a 3/spl times/3/spl times/30 mm BGO crystal, with the opposite ends of 64 such crystals attached to a single 1\" square photomultiplier tube that provides a timing signal and energy discrimination. Each BGO crystal is coated with a lossy reflector, so the ratio of light detected in the photodiode and photomultiplier tube depends on the interaction depth in the crystal, and is used to determine this depth of interaction on an event by event basis, A test module with one 3/spl times/3/spl times/30 mm BGO crystal, one 3 mm square PIN photodiode, and one photomultiplier tube is operated at -20/spl deg/C with an amplifier peaking time of 4 /spl mu/s, and a depth of interaction resolution of 5 to 8 mm fwhm measured. Simulations predict that this virtually eliminates radial elongation in a 60 cm diameter BGO tomograph. The photodiode signal corresponding to 511 keV energy deposit varies linearly with excitation position, ranging from 1250 electrons (e/sup -/) at the end closest to the photodiode to 520 e/sup -/ at the opposite end. The electronic noise is a position independent 330 e/sup -/ fwhm, so the signal to noise ratio is sufficient to reliably identify the crystal of interaction in a 64 element module.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7706/00322929.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.322929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.322929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=322929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design studies for a PET detector module using a PIN photodiode to measure depth of interaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Detectors","PIN photodiodes","Photomultipliers","Signal to noise ratio","Sensor arrays","Crystals","Timing","Event detection","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radioisotope scanning and imaging","p-i-n photodiodes","scintillation counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PET detector module","PIN photodiode","interaction depth","multi-layer PET detector module","interaction crystal indentification","square photomultiplier tube","timing signal","energy discrimination","BGO crystal","lossy reflector","amplifier peaking time","depth of interaction resolution","fwhm","radial elongation","tomograph","photodiode signal","electronic noise","signal to noise ratio","64 element module","Bi/sub 4/Ge/sub 3/O/sub 12/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Design studies for a PET detector module using a PIN photodiode to measure depth of interaction","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4780944","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design studies for a PET detector module using a PIN photodiode to measure depth of interaction","sourcePdf":"00322929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061062S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"151","articleId":"322929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":322930,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The system implements the \"clam-shell\" sampling scheme and a rotating rod transmission source. All acquisition parameters can be adjusted under computer control. Temperature stability at the detector site is ensured by the use of thermoelectric modules. The initial system consists of one layer of 256 modules (two rings of detectors) defining 3 image slices in a 118 mm diameter by 10.5 mm thick field. The axial field can be extended to 50 mm using 4 layers of modules (8 rings of detectors).

Optimization of acquisition parameters is essential, to minimize any additional noise contamination. It has previously been shown that by using a continuous or redundant axial sampling scheme, a reduction in statistical noise and improvement in image quality are possible. In this work, the continuous axial sampling technique is further characterized and compared to the conventional step-and-shoot technique. The main source of additional noise contamination with conventional sampling is the detector sensitivity normalization procedure which is applied to the emission data. With continuous axial sampling and a single normalization matrix for all planes, the statistical noise in the normalization factors is reduced by factor close to the number of planes in the scanner. The continuous sampling technique is shown to be less sensitive to small patient movements (<5 mm) compared to conventional sampling.

Various methods have been proposed for compensating for the spatially varying geometric response of the camera. Here the authors examine restoration of SPECT projection images using an artificial neural network. A three layer feedforward neural network is trained to compute the spatially-variant standard deviations of a symmetric Gaussian blur. A Hopfield network is then used to restore the projection images in which the restoration problem is formulated as a minimization of an error function of the network. Results from applying this restoration procedure on SPECT projection images are presented and the resulting SPECT reconstructions are analysed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4786778","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pre-reconstruction restoration of SPECT projection images by a neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-reconstruction restoration of SPECT projection images by a neural network","sourcePdf":"00322958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038929S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"3","articleId":"322958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":322998,"authors":[{"name":"M.-J.

The performance of 1DFS is superior to that of other fast search algorithms. And it has more regular data flow, data reuse and less control overhead. It is an alternative for 2D full search block matching and achieves a good compromise between computational complexity and performance. With competent performance and reasonable computation complexity, the proposed method is more suitable for real-time hardware realization of a VLSI motion estimator for video applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798787","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"One-dimensional full search motion estimation algorithm for video coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-dimensional full search motion estimation algorithm for video coding","sourcePdf":"00322998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051961S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"108","articleId":"322998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":322999,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Bit rate regulation is accomplished by appropriately quantizing the DCT coefficients where the quantization stepsize is obtained by multiplying a fixed weighting matrix by a scaling factor. For each frame, a single quantization scaling factor is determined by iteratively comparing the output bit rate with a target bit rate which is based upon the desirable bit rate, same code mode, frame complexity and scene changes. The iterative comparison guarantees a quantization scaling factor which results in a minimum accumulated bit rate difference from the target bit rate for each frame. The simulation results demonstrate that the fluctuation of the output bit rate can be kept within a narrow margin while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed frames at a relatively stable level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.322999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.322999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/7707/00322999.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/322999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Bit rate control for hybrid DPCM/DCT video codec","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4798788","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit rate control for hybrid DPCM/DCT video codec","sourcePdf":"00322999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084236S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","articleId":"322999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":323006,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An array of eight synapse chips, each containing 2500 synapses, is connected to a neuron chip on an MCM to implement a (150, 100, 50) network containing more than one million transistors. MCM technology enables a higher synapse density to be achieved and benefits which include smaller area and reduced parasitics can be enjoyed. The MCM is under construction, and its completion will provide a large analogue neural network in a single package which can be used for many applications which require such networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANNES.1993.323066","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323066.png","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 The First New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/924/7708/00323066.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 The First New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANNES.1993.323066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analogue neural network using MCM technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Very large scale integration","Artificial neural networks","Voltage","Multichip modules","Integrated circuit interconnections","Wire","Multilayer perceptrons","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","linear integrated circuits","multichip modules","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue neural network","multichip module technology","interchip connections","synapse chips","neuron chip","synapse density","area","parasitics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"An analogue neural network using MCM technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4677786","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analogue neural network using MCM technology","confLoc":"Dunedin, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"00323066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033759S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"924","articleId":"323066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":323070,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

The equivalent of a data-driven search strategy is commonly employed with ANNs, both in chemical engineering and in other industrial applications. The only version of a goal-driven strategy now used with artificial neural networks takes the form of inverse plant dynamic models. In industrial applications, these models have proven inadequate. Using matrix pseudoinversion, a mathematically rigorous method of inverting a feedforward neural network has been developed. This inverted network offers a new approach to goal-driven searches with neural networks. Limitations to this approach are posed by network topology, by matrix colinearity, and by differences among neural network output functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANNES.1993.323084","startPage":"52","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 The First New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANNES.1993.323084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7708","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1993 The First New Zealand International Two-Stream Conference on Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/924/7708/00323084.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restrictions on goal-driven searches using rigorously inverted artificial neural network models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323084/","displayDocTitle":"Restrictions on goal-driven searches using rigorously inverted artificial neural network models","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4677768","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restrictions on goal-driven searches using rigorously inverted artificial neural network models","confLoc":"Dunedin, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"00323084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037622S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov 1993","isNumber":"7708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"924","articleId":"323084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":323091,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Although caching provides adequate performance for many problems, caching alone is an insufficient solution for vector applications with poor temporal and spatial locality. Moreover, the nature of memories themselves has changed. Current DRAM components should not be treated as uniform access-time RAM: achieving greater bandwidth requires exploiting the characteristics of components at every level of the memory hierarchy. The authors describe hardware-assisted access ordering and a hardware development effort to build a Stream Memory Controller (SMC) that implements the technique for a commercially available high-performance microprocessor, the Intel i860. The strategy augments caching by combining compile-time detection of memory access patterns with a memory subsystem that decouples the order of requests generated by the processor from that issued to the memory system. This decoupling permits requests to be issued in an order that optimizes use of the memory system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental implementation of dynamic access ordering","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1994.323142","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/935/7709/00323142.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1994.323142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","displayDocTitle":"Experimental implementation of dynamic access ordering","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4687618","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental implementation of dynamic access ordering","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00323142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064081S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isNumber":"7709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"935","citationCount":"9","articleId":"323142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":323148,"authors":[{"name":"A.

S3.mp uses distributed directories and point-to-point messages that are sent over a packet switched interconnect fabric to achieve scalability over a wide range of configurations. S3.mp uses a new CMOS serial link technology that achieves transmission rates >1 Gbit/sec and that is directly integrated into a packet router chip. Unlike other DSM systems, S3.mp can be spatially distributed over a local area via fiber optic links. This capability allows S3.mp to interconnect clusters of workstations to form multiprocessor workgroups that efficiently share memory, processors and I/O devices. Multichip module technology, the integrated arbitrary topology router, fast serial links, and a DSM system that is integrated into the memory controller allow compact, massively parallel S3.mp systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1994.323149","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/935/7709/00323149.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1994.323149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The S3.mp scalable shared memory multiprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323149/","displayDocTitle":"The S3.mp scalable shared memory multiprocessor","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4687611","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The S3.mp scalable shared memory multiprocessor","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00323149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035854S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isNumber":"7709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"935","citationCount":"28","articleId":"323149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":323153,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Ideally, a trace should contain all the necessary events generated by a program. However, this is usually impractical for all but the most trivial of programs because of trace storage and simulation time costs. As computer systems increase in performance and complexity there is a growing need to use larger and more realistic programs for trace driven simulation. This has lead to a growing interest in applying sampling techniques to reduce trace driven simulation costs. This paper reports on same experiments in trace sampling and discusses a prediction method for resolving cold-start or fill references when simulating with a sampled trace. The paper shows how a small sampled trace can capture the characteristics of a much larger trace and cache simulations results are presented using these sampled traces and the prediction method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682106","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trace driven simulation using sampled traces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trace driven simulation using sampled traces","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00323170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038075S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isNumber":"7709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"935","citationCount":"17","articleId":"323170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":323180,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The use of regular hardware patterns such as cellular automata or pipelines allows high level definitions of the coprocessors. The results are fast prototyping possibilities for specific applications such as image processing or industrial control. Basic realizations are described. Changing from an FPGA technology to a VLSI one provider benefits with respect to cost and performance, without any effort at the specification level.

Associative broadcast exploits the broadcasting capabilities of distributed systems, and enables straightforward specification of state-based communication.

There appears to be as many methods as there are studies. This research investigates whether prior statistical deseasonalising of data is necessary for producing accurate forecasts with neural networks, or whether the networks can adequately model seasonality. Neural networks trained with deseasonalised data from (T. Hill et al., 1992) were compared with neural networks developed without prior deseasonalisation. Both sets of neural networks produced forecasts for the 68 monthly time series from the M-competition (S. Makridakis et al., 1982). Results indicate that neural network forecasts from deseasonalised data were significantly more accurate than the forecasts produced by neural networks which modeled seasonality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323316/","accessionNumber":"4687937","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Can neural networks applied to time series forecasting learn seasonal patterns: an empirical investigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can neural networks applied to time series forecasting learn seasonal patterns: an empirical investigation","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00323316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031871S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isNumber":"7711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"935","citationCount":"14","articleId":"323316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":323317,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Hao","affiliation":["Department of Applied Statistics & OR, City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Gang Hao","id":"37087441569"},{"name":"Shang","affiliation":["Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Shang","id":"37087601774"},{"name":"Vargas","affiliation":["Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Vargas","id":"37087600996"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5090-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"323317","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural network applications","Flexible manufacturing systems","Real-time systems","Self-organizing feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","flexible manufacturing systems","real-time systems","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network approach","real time control","flexible manufacturing system control","three phased model","Sigma-Pi type","neural net model","feasibility recognition","Hopfield-Tank model","NP-complete","quick response","linear energy function","routing decisions","heuristic algorithm","self-organizing feature maps"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323317","abstract":"We propose a three phased model of flexible manufacturing system control.

This problem is considered to be very difficult not only because of its NP-complete feature, but also because of the need for quick response under a real-time environment.

The authors have developed a powerful description scheme for protein conformation, MLD (Multi-Level Description) in order to model the protein structure formation. In this scheme, the description is reconstructable into the three-dimensional conformation with a tolerable error. The MLD scheme facilitates the modeling of 1) the relation between the local conformation and the primary structure at that region at various scales (i.e., primary constraints), and 2) the geometric constraints between the neighboring local conformations. Hence, in these prediction schemes, the problem of protein 3D structure prediction is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem; the 3D conformation of a protein is predicted as the optimal MLD that satisfies most of the constraints. The authors implemented several schemes to solve this problem. They prove that the degree of prediction accuracy is much improved by introducing the geometric constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1994.323561","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel2/935/7713/00323561.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1994.323561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protein structure prediction based on multi-level description","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323561/","displayDocTitle":"Protein structure prediction based on multi-level description","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4687977","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protein structure prediction based on multi-level description","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00323561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078971S","chronDate":"4-7 Jan. 1994","isNumber":"7713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"935","citationCount":"1","articleId":"323561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":323579,"authors":[{"name":"Akahoshi","affiliation":["Inst. for New Generation Comput.

We show that when using genetic algorithms to solve these kinds of applications, best results are achieved with higher than \"normal\" mutation rates. Schemata theory is used to analyze this data and show that even though schema length increases, the Hamming distance between binary representations of best-fit chromosomes is quite small.

Given a set of objects, the goal is to determine the illumination for which the objects are most distinguishable in appearance from each other. For each object, a large number of images is automatically obtained by varying pose and illumination. Images of all objects, together, constitute the planning image set. The planning set is compressed using the Karhunen-Loeve transform to obtain a low-dimensional subspace. For any given illumination, objects are represented as parametrized manifolds in the subspace. The minimum distance between the manifolds of too objects represents the similarity between the objects in the correlation sense. The optimal illumination is therefore one that maximizes the shortest distance between object manifolds. Results produced by the illumination planner heave been used to enhance the performance of an object recognition system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323807","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323807.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323807.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination planning for object recognition in structured environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323807/","displayDocTitle":"Illumination planning for object recognition in structured environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4777908","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination planning for object recognition in structured environments","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029616S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"37","articleId":"323807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":323813,"authors":[{"name":"Essa","affiliation":["Perceptual Computing Section, The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Essa","id":"37282740400"},{"name":"Pentland","affiliation":["Perceptual Computing Section, The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Pentland","id":"38186014500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323813","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Muscles","Image analysis","Psychology","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","muscle","psychology","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision system","facial action parameter extraction","action units","video sequences","visual observation","optimal estimation optical flow method","geometric model","physical model","facial structure","time-varying spatial pattern","parametric representation","independent muscle action groups","image analysis","image interpretation","image synthesis","facial motions","physics-based optimal estimation framework","geometry-based","FACS parameters","temporal information","nonlocal spatial patterning"]}],"abstract":"We describe a computer vision system for observing the \"action units\" of a face using video sequences as input. The visual observation (sensing) is achieved by using an optimal estimation optical flow method coupled with a geometric and a physical (muscle) model describing the facial structure. This modeling results in a time-varying spatial patterning of facial shape and a parametric representation of the independent muscle action groups, responsible for the observed facial motions. These muscle action patterns may then be used for analysis, interpretation, and synthesis. Thus, by interpreting facial motions within a physics-based optimal estimation framework, a new control model of facial movement is developed. The newly extracted action units (which we name \"FACS+\") are both physics and geometry-based, and extend the well-known FACS parameters for facial expressions by adding temporal information and non-local spatial patterning of facial motion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system for observing and extracting facial action parameters","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323813","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323813.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323813.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A vision system for observing and extracting facial action parameters","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4777914","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system for observing and extracting facial action parameters","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043831S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"68","articleId":"323813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":323814,"authors":[{"name":"Pentland","affiliation":["Perceptual Computing Group, The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Pentland","id":"38186014500"},{"name":"Moghaddam","affiliation":["Perceptual Computing Group, The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Moghaddam","id":"37269463800"},{"name":"Starner","affiliation":["Perceptual Computing Group, The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Starner","id":"37269366200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323814","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1067,"citationCountPatent":52,"totalDownloads":3389},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image shape analysis","Image databases","Interactive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","visual databases","interactive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular eigenspaces","face recognition","interactive search","large-scale face database","visual recognition","general viewing orientation","view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique","variable pose","eyes","nose","mouth","recognition rates","automatic feature extraction","feature eigentemplates"]}],"abstract":"We describe experiments with eigenfaces for recognition and interactive search in a large-scale face database.

In particular, we show how to compute local flow, global (parametric) flow, rigid flow resulting from camera egomotion, and multiframe versions of the above problems. Using a spline-based description of the flow removes the need for overlapping correlation windows, and produces an explicit measure of the correlation between adjacent flow estimates.

Recently, for example, a technique called color indexing due to M. Swain and D.

The effectiveness of this and other approaches that match color distributions, however, depends on the approximate constancy of the scene illumination. In this paper, we develop color histogram descriptors that are invariant to changes in the intensity and spectral distribution of the illumination. We present a set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of these descriptors for object recognition in the presence of changes in illuminant spectral power distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323851.png","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323851.pdf","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using illumination invariant descriptors for recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination invariant descriptors","color pixel distributions","object recognition","color indexing","color histograms","scene geometry","occlusion","illuminant spectral power distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Using illumination invariant descriptors for recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323851/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4777953","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using illumination invariant descriptors for recognition","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027813S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"7","articleId":"323851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":323860,"authors":[{"name":"Young","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Amherst, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Young","id":"37087528926"},{"name":"Scott","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Amherst, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Scott","id":"37089044483"},{"name":"Nasrabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Amherst, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Nasrabadi","id":"37087210343"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323860","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Feedforward neural networks","Neural network applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","multilayer Hopfield neural network","encoding","bidirectional interconnections","translation","rotation","model-object match"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323860","abstract":"An object recognition approach based on concurrent coarse-and-fine matching using a multi-layer Hopfield neural network is presented.

The computed image motion of this image region is used to register the images so that the detected image region appears stationary. The resulting displacement field for the entire scene between the registered frames is affected only by the 3D translation of the camera. After canceling the effects of the camera rotation by using such 2D image registration, the 3D camera translation is computed by finding the focus-of-expansion in the translation-only set of registered frames. This step is followed by computing the camera rotation to complete the computation of the ego-motion. The presented method avoids the inherent problems in the computation of optical flow and of feature matching, and does not assume any prior feature detection or feature correspondence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323866","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","startPage":"454","endPage":"460","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323866.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery of ego-motion using image stabilization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of ego-motion using image stabilization","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323866/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4777968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of ego-motion using image stabilization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037636S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"91","articleId":"323866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":323868,"authors":[{"name":"Niyogi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, MIT Media Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Niyogi","id":"37354223400"},{"name":"Adelson","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT Media Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Adelson","id":"37349732300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323868","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":347,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":1011},"abstract":"We describe a novel algorithm for gait analysis.

Individual gaits can be recognized by applying standard pattern recognition techniques to the contour signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323868.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323868.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing and recognizing walking figures in XYT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomechanics","Pattern recognition","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","image recognition","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["walking figures","gait analysis","braided pattern","spatiotemporal volume","XYT","spatiotemporal snakes","pattern recognition","contour signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing and recognizing walking figures in XYT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4777970","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing and recognizing walking figures in XYT","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018725S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"347","articleId":"323868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":323869,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsung Kim","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Dongsung Kim","id":"37655649600"},{"name":"Ramakant Nevatia","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ramakant Nevatia","id":"37067947300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323869","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots, motion planning","Machine vision","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","computer vision","spatial data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial environment","indoor navigation","spatial representation","s-map","indoor navigation robot","viewing triangle constraint","stability constraint","verification of vertical surfaces","map fusion","path planning","complexity","reliability"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a spatial representation, s-map, for an indoor navigation robot. The s-map represents the locations of obstacles in a planar domain, where obstacles are defined as any objects that can block movement of the robot. In building the s-map, the viewing triangle constraint and the stability constraint are introduced for efficient verification of vertical surfaces. These verified vertical surfaces and 3-D segments of obstacles smaller than a robot, are mapped to the s-map by simply dropping height information. Thus, the s-map is made directly from 3-D segments with simple verification, and represents obstacles in a planar domain so that it becomes a navigable map for the robot without further processing. In addition to efficient map building, the s-map represents the environment more realistically and completely. Furthermore, the s-map converts many navigation problems in 3-D, such as map fusion and path planning, into 2-D ones. We present the analysis of the s-map in terms of complexity and reliability, and discuss its pros and cons. Moreover, we show the results of the s-maps for indoor environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation and computation of the spatial environment for indoor navigation","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323869","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323869.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Representation and computation of the spatial environment for indoor navigation","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4777971","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation and computation of the spatial environment for indoor navigation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03833S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"4","articleId":"323869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":323870,"authors":[{"name":"Shashua","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Center for Biol. and Comp.

While some systems, especially template-based ones, have been quite successful on expressionless, frontal views of faces with controlled lighting, not much work has taken face recognizers beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal is to build a face recognizer that works under varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle face relations in depth. Building on successful template-based systems, our basic approach is to represent faces with templates from multiple model views that cover different poses from the viewing sphere. To recognize a novel view, the recognizer locates the eyes and nose features, uses these locations to geometrically register the input with model views, and then uses correlation on model templates to find the best match in the data base of people. Our system has achieved a recognition rate of 98% on a data base of 62 people containing 10 testing and 15 modeling views per person.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323893","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","startPage":"756","endPage":"761","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00323893.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition under varying pose","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition under varying pose","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323893/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4771241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition under varying pose","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037783S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"141","articleId":"323893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":323907,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Nelson","id":"37087491234"},{"name":"Khosla","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Khosla","id":"37087490661"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323907","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots, vision systems","Stereo vision","Servosystems","Manipulators, motion planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","stereo image processing","distance measurement","servomechanisms","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual servoing","resolvability ellipsoid","sensor placement measure","monocular systems","stereo pairs","multi-baseline stereo systems","3D rangefinders","visually manipulated objects","camera motion","Jacobian mapping","camera-lens motion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323907","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323907.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The resolvability ellipsoid for visual servoing","abstract":"This paper introduces a sensor placement measure called resolvability. The measure provides a technique for estimating the relative ability of various visual sensors, including monocular systems, stereo pairs, multi-baseline stereo systems, and 3D rangefinders, to accurately control visually manipulated objects. The resolvability ellipsoid illustrates the directional nature of resolvability, and can be used to direct camera motion and adjust camera intrinsic parameters in real-time so that the servoing accuracy of the visual servoing system improves with camera-lens motion. The Jacobian mapping from task space to sensor space is derived for a monocular system, a stereo pair with parallel optical axes, and a stereo pair with perpendicular optical axes. Resolvability ellipsoids based on these mappings for various sensor configurations are presented. Visual servoing experiments demonstrate that resolvability can be used to direct camera-lens motion in order to increase the ability of a visually servoed manipulator to precisely servo objects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4771255","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The resolvability ellipsoid for visual servoing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The resolvability ellipsoid for visual servoing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043348S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"25","articleId":"323907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":323927,"authors":[{"name":"Sawhney","affiliation":["Machine Vision Group, IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sawhney","id":"37269465000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323927","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":578},"abstract":"Deriving 3D structure in a fixed object-centered coordinate system is an increasingly popular trend in shape from multiple views. For linear approximations to perspective projection (weak/para perspective), and for the case of image velocities, elegant linear methods have been devised for robust estimation. For reconstruction under arbitrary view transformations, linear projective methods using point correspondences have been suggested. In this paper, we formulate the problem of intrinsic 3D structure estimation through perspective projection using motion parallax, defined with respect to an arbitrary plane in the environment. It is shown that if an image coordinate system is warped using plane projective transformation with respect to a reference view, the residual image motion is dependent only on the epipoles and has a simple relation to the 3D structure. Our computational scheme avoids point/line correspondence and is based on hierarchical estimation and image warping working directly with spatio-temporal image intensities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/977/7716/00323927.pdf","startPage":"929","endPage":"934","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1994.323927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1994.323927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=323927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D geometry from planar parallax","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image motion analysis","Estimation","Geometric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","motion estimation","estimation theory","computational geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D geometry","planar parallax","3D structure","fixed object-centered coordinate system","shape from multiple views","linear approximations","perspective projection","image velocities","linear method","robust estimation","motion parallax","image motion","image warping","spatio-temporal image intensities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/323927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"3D geometry from planar parallax","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4771275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D geometry from planar parallax","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00323927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032387S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1994","isNumber":"7716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"977","citationCount":"67","articleId":"323927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":323941,"authors":[{"name":"Hallinan","affiliation":["Division of Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Hallinan","id":"37354921200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5825-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6919"}],"articleNumber":"323941","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":194,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Lighting","Image representations","Image analysis","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","lighting","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human faces","lighting conditions","fixed object","fixed viewpoint","image intensity","lighting changes","face image","self-shadowing surfaces"]}],"abstract":"When recognizing a fixed object from a fixed viewpoint, the dominant source of variation in image intensity is lighting changes.

The FDTD algorithm, a discretisation of Maxwell's curl equations used to solve electromagnetic boundary value problems is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940093","publicationTitle":"1994 Second International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Second International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/1170/7719/00324029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7719","startPage":"367","endPage":"370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel implementations of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Parallel implementations of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324029/","conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682561","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel implementations of the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00324029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035677S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7719","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1170","citationCount":"11","articleId":"324029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":324034,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The results show that wavelet transform can be used to provide more relevant information for improving the detection of epileptogenic spikes for automated EEG monitoring of seizure patients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1994.324252","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1106/7722/00324252.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1994.324252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of wavelet transform as a preprocessor for the neural network detection of EEG spikes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Neural networks","Electroencephalography","Epilepsy","Biological neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Biomedical engineering","Patient monitoring","Computerized monitoring","Scalp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","medical signal processing","electroencephalography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform preprocessor","neural network detection","EEG spikes","EEG data processing","epileptogenic transient waveforms detection","contextual information","nonspikes","automated EEG monitoring","seizure patients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"The use of wavelet transform as a preprocessor for the neural network detection of EEG spikes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","accessionNumber":"4783979","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of wavelet transform as a preprocessor for the neural network detection of EEG spikes","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00324252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063528S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1106","citationCount":"6","articleId":"324252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":324284,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

The two infinitesimally thin strips with arbitrary size are clad on the coupled dielectric circular cylinders. The coupling between the two conducting strips of the coupled microstrip line is investigated. The first and higher order elements are used in the finite-element method to calculate for the quasi-static potential and the corresponding field distribution in the microstrip line. The capacitance per unit length of the line is obtained from a variational expression and the effective dielectric constant, characteristic impedance, and phase velocity are also computed.

This, of course eliminates the need for complete point-to-point interconnection of all the devices attached to the bus. The major hurdle to this system is in resolving the conflicts that arise when more than one device wants to use the bus to communicate at a time. The job of resolving such conflicts is left to bus arbitration circuitry. A system designer using the MC68000 family is in some luck. This series of microprocessors has a limited set of lines built in to allow for external circuitry to request and receive the bus from the processor. However, having given up the bus the processor does nothing to decide who receives the bus next. This is left to external arbitration circuitry. This paper describes a VLSI chip designed to perform bus arbitration for the Motorola MC68000 series of microprocessors. With such a module, several devices (such as DMA, I/O controllers, and multiple microprocessors) can share a single bus while our device handles all bus conflicts using a priority scheme. The device is flexible, programmable, and compatible with the MC68000 family's bus architecture and their support chips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECON.1994.324344","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1106/7722/00324344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.1994.324344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7722","startPage":"398","endPage":"402","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00324344.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI design of a bus arbitration module for the 68000 series of microprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI design of a bus arbitration module for the 68000 series of microprocessors","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324344/","conferenceDate":"10-13 April 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4784033","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI design of a bus arbitration module for the 68000 series of microprocessors","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00324344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052193S","chronDate":"10-13 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1106","citationCount":"1","articleId":"324344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":324361,"authors":[{"name":"Duanpei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Duanpei Wu","id":"37087349730"},{"name":"J.N.

In order to reduce the wiring capacitance, applying low dielectric materials to ULSI is most effective and developments of low dielectric materials have been reported recently. However, there have been no studies of applying those to sub-half micron CMOS. In this study, it is reported for the first time that the new low dielectric material \"SiOF\" which has been proposed previously has been applied to sub-half micron CMOS and the improvement of circuit performance has been confirmed. Moreover, it is clearly demonstrated that the SiOF film is inevitable to improve the circuit speed of 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS with the scaling trend. Also, it is emphasized that the reduction of wiring capacitance with SiOF film is important from the viewpoint of power reduction in sub-half micron CMOS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 VLSI Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1128/7723/00324378.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 VLSI Technology Symposium","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.1994.324378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.1994.324378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of wiring capacitance with new low dielectric SiOF interlayer film for high speed/low power sub-half micron CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wiring","Capacitance","Dielectric films","Dielectric materials","Dielectric constant","Ultra large scale integration","Delay","Polymers","Filling","MOSFET circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wiring","metallisation","capacitance","silicon compounds","dielectric thin films","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wiring capacitance","SiOF interlayer film","high speed/low power circuits","wiring delay","low dielectric material","circuit speed","scaling trend","power reduction","sub-half micron CMOS","0.35 micron","SiOF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of wiring capacitance with new low dielectric SiOF interlayer film for high speed/low power sub-half micron CMOS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4759288","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of wiring capacitance with new low dielectric SiOF interlayer film for high speed/low power sub-half micron CMOS","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00324378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039185S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1994","isNumber":"7723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1128","citationCount":"18","articleId":"324378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":324380,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Some new structures and operating methods for future flash memories have been proposed. However, the most suitable structure to realize large memory capacity for magnetic disk replacement will be different from that for fast random access speed for EPROM replacement, flash-memory-embedded logic devices, and other high speed applications. To realize high speed random access operation, conventional NOR-type flash memory technology with CHE program and source erase scheme will be the most suitable because of its simple fabrication process, relatively small cell size, sufficiently high read current, and relatively low operation voltages for program and erase procedures. The low voltage program/erase operation results in high performance peripheral transistors. On the other hand, NAND flash EEPROM will be the most suitable for low-cost large memory capacity applications.

A 20X reduction in power/circuit is achieved at the same performance level as 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4759263","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An ultra-low power 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultra-low power 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00324403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067331S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1994","isNumber":"7723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1128","citationCount":"17","articleId":"324403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":324404,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Usually complex design requires higher abstraction in order to cope with the design scale, on the other hand, because of the critical device characteristics and interconnect phenomena, technology dependent design is also necessary. In addition to performance and crosstalk requirement, power limitation including electromigration should be appropriately simulated. Packaging is another important differentiater and large cost factor. Testing is now often a critical path, and also suffering from cost burden. It should be noted that testing is a part of the design effort, but limits manufacturability considerably. Semiconductor vendors will become more and more solution providers rather than component suppliers, thus should cover system level design to all way down to manufacturing in various different segments. However, a single company can never achieve such a goal alone, that is why vertical and horizontal alliances have started to make sense. The answer to the challenges are global standardizations and alliance/partnership models in various different manners.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiconductor technology crisis and challenges towards the year 2000","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 VLSI Technology Symposium","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.1994.324404","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 VLSI Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/1128/7723/00324404.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.1994.324404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Semiconductor technology crisis and challenges towards the year 2000","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4759262","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiconductor technology crisis and challenges towards the year 2000","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00324404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021315S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1994","isNumber":"7723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1128","citationCount":"4","articleId":"324404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":324411,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The V/spl Phi/T is a vertical MOSFET whose gate surrounds its channel region like a Greek alphabet /spl Phi/. It is built by penetration of the gate electrode (=word line) which has been formed beforehand. Application of the V/spl Phi/T for DRAM cell brings about cell size reduction to 50% and process simplification of about 10% at least. This is mainly because its bit line contact and the V/spl Phi/T are vertically aligned and storage node contact is eliminated.

Results showed that the injection of drugs drastically improved the diagnostic performance of the turbulent sounds in detecting stenoses by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the sounds. Results also suggested that the sound above 250 Hz was drastically increased in response to the injection of the vasodilator drug for the partially occluded cases. The turbulence sounds caused by partially occluded femoral arteries are directly related to the slope of baseline of blood flow and to the velocity of the flow. For the 0% occlusion case, initially, sounds were produced with the injection of drugs. However, the sounds totally disappeared when the slope of average blood how was zero. These results show that the diagnostic performance of diastolic heart sounds associated with occluded arteries can be improved by using vasodilator drugs, which increase the acoustic energy in the first and second wavelet bandwidths due to the turbulence. The short-term Fourier transform (STFT) method was also applied to the same data base. Results using the STFT showed somewhat similar power distributions in that the acoustical power above 250 Hz was increased after the injection of drugs for the occluded cases. However, the WT method provided better time-frequency resolution than the STFT method, showing details of the change in the frequency characteristics with respect to time after the injection of drug.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating the effects of vasodilator drugs on the turbulent sound caused by femoral artery stenosis using short-term Fourier and wavelet transform methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.324523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7725/00324523.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.324523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the effects of vasodilator drugs on the turbulent sound caused by femoral artery stenosis using short-term Fourier and wavelet transform methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4792159","pubMedId":"7959798","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the effects of vasodilator drugs on the turbulent sound caused by femoral artery stenosis using short-term Fourier and wavelet transform methods","sourcePdf":"00324523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052175S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"18","articleId":"324523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":324525,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

An enzyme electrode sensor measures the oxidation current of hydrogen peroxide formed by the stoichiometric conversion of glucose substrate and oxygen cofactor in an immobilized glucose oxidase layer. The sensor current is converted to a frequency and transmitted at programmable intervals (4, 32, 256 s) to a remote receiver. Low power CMOS circuitry is employed and device operation for up to 1.5 years is predicted using two series connected 250 mAh lithium cells. Crystal controlled RF frequencies uniquely identify each sensor allowing over 10 sensors within the same 10 m radius. A custom interface card allows a PC to program the receiver and handle the transmitted sensor data using software written in Microsoft C and QuickBasic. Software control allows on-the-fly sensor addition or subtraction to the sensor group being monitored. Over 10 sensors can be tracked long-term using the longest transmit interval, or four sensors can be tracked during short-term infusion studies when the transmit interval is reduced to 4 s. The design, construction, operation, and performance of the system hardware and software are described and evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00324525.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.324525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7725/00324525.pdf","endPage":"942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A telemetry-instrumentation system for monitoring multiple subcutaneously implanted glucose sensors","doi":"10.1109/10.324525","startPage":"937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A telemetry-instrumentation system for monitoring multiple subcutaneously implanted glucose sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324525/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4792161","pubMedId":"7959800","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A telemetry-instrumentation system for monitoring multiple subcutaneously implanted glucose sensors","sourcePdf":"00324525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"83","articleId":"324525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":324532,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Analyses of both simulated and real data were carried out. Automated REM tabulations are compared with visual scoring by a trained observer. Both preterm and fullterm neonates were used to test these methods. Both the advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are discussed as compared with conventional methods which use only amplitude and synchrony threshold criteria. The major advantage of the extended conventional over the conventional method, as well as the matched filtering over the extended conventional technique, is the increased REM detection rate for ten minute intervals of artifact-free sleep. More accurate methods of automated REM detection that can be applied over extended monitoring periods are still needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324532/","volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4792168","pubMedId":"7959807","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of conventional and matched filtering techniques for rapid eye movement detection of the newborn [electro-oculography]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of conventional and matched filtering techniques for rapid eye movement detection of the newborn [electro-oculography]","sourcePdf":"00324532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059879S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"15","articleId":"324532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":324545,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Basic tasks of Boolean manipulation such as equivalence test, satisfiability test, tautology test and single Boolean synthesis steps can be performed efficiently in terms of fixed ordered OBDD's. The bottleneck of most OBDD-applications is the size of the represented Boolean functions since the total computation merely remains tractable as long as the OBDD-representations remain of reasonable size. Since it is well known that OBDD's are restricted FBDD's (free BDD's, i.e., BDD's that test, on each path, each input variable at most once), and that FBDD-representations are often much more (sometimes even exponentially more) concise than OBDD-representations. We propose to work with a more general FBDD-based data structure. We show that FBDD's of a fixed type provide, similar as OBDD's of a fixed variable ordering, canonical representations of Boolean functions, and that basic tasks of Boolean manipulation can be performed in terms of fixed typed FBDD's similarly efficient as in terms of fixed ordered OBDD's. In order to demonstrate the power of the FBDD-concept we show that the verification of the circuit design for the hidden weighted bit function proposed Bryant can be carried out efficiently in terms of FBDD's while this is, for principal reasons, impossible in terms of OBDD's.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.324545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.324545","endPage":"1209","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00324545.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7726/00324545.pdf","startPage":"1197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Boolean manipulation with OBDD's can be extended to FBDD's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324545/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Boolean manipulation with OBDD's can be extended to FBDD's","volume":"43","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4786804","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Boolean manipulation with OBDD's can be extended to FBDD's","sourcePdf":"00324545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043089S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"71","articleId":"324545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":324547,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

Two different approaches can be employed to overcome this constraint: first, an argument reduction method and, second, an expansion of the CORDIC convergence domain. While the first approach requires significant processing overhead due to the need for divisions especially for tanh/sup -1/, the second technique achieves an increased but still limited convergence domain only. In this brief contribution, we present a unified division-free argument reduction method and a regular pipeline/array architecture for floating point or fixed point implementations which results in savings of computation time. In contrast to previous methods we avoid extra CORDIC arithmetic for realization of argument reduction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.324568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7727/00324568.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.324568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified and division-free CORDIC argument reduction method with unlimited convergence domain including inverse hyperbolic functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A unified and division-free CORDIC argument reduction method with unlimited convergence domain including inverse hyperbolic functions","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4792179","volume":"43","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified and division-free CORDIC argument reduction method with unlimited convergence domain including inverse hyperbolic functions","sourcePdf":"00324568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031613S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","articleId":"324568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":324584,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

Included in this unified model are the effects of lateral diffusion of charge carriers within a two-layer substrate and less than full pixel sampling apertures. The results of this model are compared to those of a numerical, three-dimensional Monte Carlo algorithm and to the analytical results reported by Blouke and Robinson. We find good agreement between the quantum efficiency and MTF calculated by the present model and by the three-dimensional Monte Carlo method. However, we find higher quantum efficiency and lower MTF than the previously reported analytical two-layer model.

Conventional and modern beamforming approaches are motivated and defined, and the advantages and drawbacks of each are discussed. The potential power of modern beamforming techniques is illustrated through a computer simulation evaluating the ability of several beamforming techniques to resolve between two closely spaced sources.

This idea is used to derive the impulse response in terms of parameters such as the zero-dispersion wavelength, the second derivative of the refractive index, and the linewidth of the source. The result indicates an asymmetrical impulse response, and the corresponding transfer function has a low-pass characteristic with a first-order pole which may be readily determined from the fiber parameters. The derived impulse response is applied to the case of a simple fiber-optic communication system configured as a phase diversity receiver, to illustrate how a linear systems approach, under certain approximations, may be used to predict and analyze the behavior of such a system. The analysis includes calculations involving the field amplitudes in (n*n) hybrid couplers, and how such couplers must be connected in order to obtain the desired optical components in the phase diversity scheme is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivation of impulse response and transfer function of an optical fiber under chromatic dispersion and application to a linear fiber-optic communication system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Technical Conference on Southern Tier","doi":"10.1109/STIER.1990.324647","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Technical Conference on Southern Tier","pdfPath":"/iel2/178/7729/00324647.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STIER.1990.324647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Derivation of impulse response and transfer function of an optical fiber under chromatic dispersion and application to a linear fiber-optic communication system","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4038943","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivation of impulse response and transfer function of an optical fiber under chromatic dispersion and application to a linear fiber-optic communication system","confLoc":"Binghamton, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00324647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048482S","chronDate":"25 Apr 1990","isNumber":"7729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"178","citationCount":"1","articleId":"324647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":324669,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

Extension of this theory to include the wavelength dependences of other components in an amplifier chain is also discussed and demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.324680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7730/00324680.pdf","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1100","doi":"10.1109/68.324680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of gain peak wavelength for Er-doped fiber amplifiers and amplifier chains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of gain peak wavelength for Er-doped fiber amplifiers and amplifier chains","volume":"6","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4793197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of gain peak wavelength for Er-doped fiber amplifiers and amplifier chains","sourcePdf":"00324680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037336S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"18","articleId":"324680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":324686,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

Optical disk storage has been touted as a replacement for magnetic disks, but suffers from longer access times and lower data rates. The lower data rate of optical disks is partially due to lower disk rotation rates, but mainly a result of reading optical disks individually, rather than in parallel like magnetic disks. Reading several optical disks in parallel is possible but may complicate the removability of the disks.

In reality, most CDMA approaches have a bandwidth penalty due to the code length and a loss penalty due to the broadcasting required by CDMA. Both of these penalties can be reduced or ameliorated by means of multi-attribute coding. Matrices constructed from relatively inefficient (0,1) pulse sequences are suitable multi-attribute non-coherent CDMA codes which are both bandwidth and broadcast efficient. We exhibit a novel approach to synthesizing matrix CDMA codes, develop a 4/spl times/4 physical model, and demonstrate concurrent communication experimentally at concurrent data rates of 100-, 150-, and 250 Mb/s per port.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis and demonstration of high speed, bandwidth efficient optical code division multiple access (CDMA) tested at 1 Gb/s throughput","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.324694","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7730/00324694.pdf","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.324694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis and demonstration of high speed, bandwidth efficient optical code division multiple access (CDMA) tested at 1 Gb/s throughput","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4793211","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis and demonstration of high speed, bandwidth efficient optical code division multiple access (CDMA) tested at 1 Gb/s throughput","sourcePdf":"00324694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065994S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"7730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"29","articleId":"324694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":324697,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We show how the output of an array can be written as the product of a wavefield independent sampling matrix and an array independent coefficient vector. Using this decomposition, we derive the conditions under which the array output may be linearly interpolated to give the array output of a different array, within a desired accuracy. We proceed to show under what conditions the array output may be linearly interpolated to give the value of the wavefield over a continuous manifold. As a result, we also derive conditions under which the array manifold may be linearly transformed between frequencies. Finally, we treat the case where the sources are known to be limited to specific, possibly disjoint angular sectors of arbitrary shape, and show how the sampling matrix can in this case be replaced by a modified sampling matrix of lower rank. This result yields a straightforward extension of the formalism presented in this paper to the Ease of limited angular sectors.

This method is extended to three dimensions and to sector processing. We then develop computationally efficient implementations of MUSIC and Root-MUSIC for the narrowband and the coherent and incoherent wideband cases, as well as a natural extension of Root-MUSIC to any 2-D array. In addition, wavefield modeling allows us for the first time to extend Root-MUSIC to 3-D arrays and wavefields. We also present a low complexity variant of Root-MUSIC for direction finding within a limited angular sector.

We use here the wavefield modeling formalism in order to derive some fundamental limitations on the performance of passive arrays. We first derive upper bounds on both the ideal and effective resolution capacities, and show that the effective resolution capacity is bounded by the effective rank of the relevant sampling matrix, i.e., is determined by the array structure. We then study how the resolution capacity is affected when the sources are constrained to lie within an angular sector. We also look at the case where the source spectra are known a priori to be flat, and show that, contrary to the common opinion, if the array satisfies the spectral sampling condition, the effective wideband resolution capacity is bounded by the same bound as the narrowband one. We conclude by examining the interesting phenomenon of resonance in arrays. We show that these resonances, far from being mathematical artifacts, can manifest quite dramatically in the performance of arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"42","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4798793","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wavefield modeling and array processing.

No assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the missing samples, in contrast with the often studied extrapolation problem, in which the known samples are grouped together. Indeed, it is possible to regard the observed signal as a sampled version of the original one, and to interpret the reconstruction result studied as a sampling result. The authors show that the iterative algorithm converges if the density of the sampling set exceeds a certain minimum value which naturally increases with the bandwidth of the data. They give upper and lower bounds for the error as a function of the number of iterations, together with the signals for which the bounds are attained. Also, they analyze the effect of a relaxation constant present in the algorithm on the spectral radius of the iteration matrix. From this analysis they infer the optimum value of the relaxation constant. They also point out, among all sampling sets with the same density, those for which the convergence rate of the recovery algorithm is maximum or minimum. For low-pass signals it turns out that the best convergence rates result when the distances among the missing samples are a multiple of a certain integer. The worst convergence rates generally occur when the missing samples are contiguous.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.324726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation and the discrete Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation and the discrete Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798795","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation and the discrete Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm","sourcePdf":"00324726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083746S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"85","articleId":"324726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":324727,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, when the input data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, the algorithm converges slowly. To overcome the slow convergence, an adaptive structure is studied, which incorporates an LMS adaptive predictor (prewhitener) prior to the LMS algorithm for system identification (canceler). Since the prewhitener is also adaptive, the input to the LMS canceler is nonstationary, even when the input is stationary. Because of the coupling and the nonstationarity of LMS canceler input, analysis of the performance of the two adaptations is extremely difficult. A simple theoretical model of the coupled adaptations is presented and analyzed. First and second moment analysis indicates that the adaptive predictor significantly speeds up the LMS canceler as compared to a system without prewhitening and enlarges the stability domain of the canceler (larger allowable /spl mu/). Monte-Carlo simulations are presented which are in good agreement with the predictions of the mathematical model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LMS coupled adaptive prediction and system identification: a statistical model and transient mean analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.324727","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324727.pdf","startPage":"2607","endPage":"2615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"LMS coupled adaptive prediction and system identification: a statistical model and transient mean analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798796","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LMS coupled adaptive prediction and system identification: a statistical model and transient mean analysis","sourcePdf":"00324727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05319S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","articleId":"324727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":324730,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

By examining the time domain description of the two-channel orthogonal filter bank the authors find it possible to construct a set of orthogonal boundary filters, which allows to apply the filter bank to one-sided or finite-length signals, without redundancy or distortion. The method is constructive and complete. There is a whole space of orthogonal boundary solutions, and there is considerable freedom for optimization. This may be used to generate subband tree structures where the tree varies over time, and to change between different filter sets. The authors also show that the iteration of discrete-time time-varying filter banks gives continuous-time bases, just as in the stationary case.

In the classical EM paradigm, one iteratively maximizes the conditional log-likelihood of a single unobservable complete data space, rather than maximizing the intractable likelihood function for the measured or incomplete data. EM algorithms update all parameters simultaneously, which has two drawbacks: 1) slow convergence, and 2) difficult maximization steps due to coupling when smoothness penalties are used. The paper describes the space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) method, which updates the parameters sequentially by alternating between several small hidden-data spaces defined by the algorithm designer. The authors prove that the sequence of estimates monotonically increases the penalized-likelihood objective, derive asymptotic convergence rates, and provide sufficient conditions for monotone convergence in norm. Two signal processing applications illustrate the method: estimation of superimposed signals in Gaussian noise, and image reconstruction from Poisson measurements. In both applications, the SAGE algorithms easily accommodate smoothness penalties and converge faster than the EM algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.324732","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00324732.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324732","startPage":"2664","endPage":"2677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324732.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4798801","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm","sourcePdf":"00324732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069496S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"697","articleId":"324732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":324736,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The effect of jitter in sampling on the spectrum and bispectrum of the sampled data has been considered previously. Methods of detecting the presence of jitter in a uniform sampling process and of estimating its variance based on a test statistic calculated from the bispectrum estimates have been proposed. The present authors demonstrate, by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, how these results can be applied in an actual case. For this purpose, samples taken from a stationary band-limited process in sampling times given by a random jitter process are generated by computer. The authors then apply the jitter detection and estimation methods that have been developed in previous work and study how their performance depends on signal duration and on jitter variance. They examine the actual simulation results concerning detection probability, estimation bias, and estimation variance in comparison with the theoretical results. This comparison indicates that the bispectrum is a domain where jitter detection and estimation with high performance can be achieved, provided that a signal with sufficiently long duration and high skewness is available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798805","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The bispectrum of sampled data.

This is motivated by the fact that higher order cumulants of Gaussian processes vanish. We study the opposite problem, namely, detection and estimation in nonGaussian noise. We estimate cumulants of nonGaussian processes in the presence of unknown deterministic and/or Gaussian signals, which allows either parametric or nonparametric estimation of the covariance of the nonGaussian noise. Our approach is to augment existing second-order detection methods using cumulants. We propose solutions for detection of deterministic signals based on matched filters and the generalized likelihood ratio test which incorporate cumulants, where the resulting solutions are valid under either detection hypotheses. This allows for single record detection and obviates the need for noise-only training records. The problem of estimating signal strength in the presence of nonGaussian noise of unknown covariance is also considered, and a cumulant-based solution is proposed which uses a single data record.

The algorithms are based on a first-order perturbation analysis of the rank-one update for covariance matrix estimates with exponential windows. Different assumptions on the eigenvalue structure lead to three distinct algorithms with varying degrees of complexity. A stabilization technique is presented and both issues of initialization and computational complexity are discussed. Computer simulations indicate that the new algorithms can achieve the same performance as a direct approach in which the exact eigendecomposition of the updated sample covariance matrix is obtained at each iteration. Previous algorithms with similar performance require O(LM/sup 2/) complex operations per iteration, where L and M respectively denote the data vector and signal-subspace dimensions, and involve either some form of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization or a nonlinear eigenvalue search. The new algorithms have parallel structures, sequential operation counts of order O(LM) or less, and do not involve any of the above steps. One particular algorithm can be used to update the complete signal-subspace eigenstructure in 5LM complex operations. This represents an order of magnitude improvement in computational complexity over existing algorithms with similar performance. Finally, a simplified local convergence analysis of one of the algorithms shows that it is stable and converges in the mean to the true eigendecomposition. The convergence is geometrical and is characterized by a single time constant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.324741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324741.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","startPage":"2758","endPage":"2770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive eigendecomposition of data covariance matrices based on first-order perturbations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive eigendecomposition of data covariance matrices based on first-order perturbations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798810","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive eigendecomposition of data covariance matrices based on first-order perturbations","sourcePdf":"00324741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057404S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"95","articleId":"324741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":324743,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Zoltowski","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Zoltowski","id":"37278519000"},{"name":"C.P.

The algorithm provides unambiguous frequency estimation despite severe temporal undersampling necessitated by cost/complexity of hardware considerations. The 2-18 GHz spectrum is decomposed into 1-GHz bands. The baseband output of each antenna is sent through two 250-MHz sampled channels where one is delayed relative to the other (prior to sampling) by 0.5 ns, which is the Nyquist interval for a 1-GHz bandwidth. Due to the high variance of the Direct ESPRIT frequency estimator, aliased frequencies are estimated via a simple formula and translated to the proper aliasing zone, utilizing eigenvector information generated by PRO-ESPRIT. The algorithm also provides unambigous 2-D angle estimate over the entire 2-18 GHz bandwidth, despite severe spatial undersampling at the higher end of this band necessitated by mutual coupling considerations and resolving power requirements at the lower end of the band. Eigenvector information generated by PRO-ESPRTT is used to facilitate computationally simple estimation of azimuth and elevation angles that are automatically paired with corresponding frequency estimates despite aliasing. Simulations are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324743","doi":"10.1109/78.324743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324743.pdf","startPage":"2781","endPage":"2794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time frequency and 2-D angle estimation with sub-Nyquist spatio-temporal sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time frequency and 2-D angle estimation with sub-Nyquist spatio-temporal sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time frequency and 2-D angle estimation with sub-Nyquist spatio-temporal sampling","sourcePdf":"00324743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044781S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"93","articleId":"324743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":324744,"authors":[{"name":"Jenq-Neng Hwang","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Jenq-Neng Hwang","id":"37087151017"},{"name":"Shyh-Rong Lay","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Shyh-Rong Lay","id":"37087173216"},{"name":"A.

Performance evaluations using training data from mixture Gaussian and mixture Cauchy densities are presented. The results show that the curse of dimensionality and the sensitivity of control parameters have a much more adverse impact on the kernel density estimators than on the projection pursuit density estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.324744","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7732/00324744.pdf","startPage":"2795","endPage":"2810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.324744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric multivariate density estimation: a comparative study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric multivariate density estimation: a comparative study","volume":"42","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4798813","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric multivariate density estimation: a comparative study","sourcePdf":"00324744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037063S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"174","articleId":"324744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":324753,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The control input switches from one control law to another when the state crosses the boundary manifolds. In general, the control input may not be smooth when switching at these boundary manifolds and may excite high frequency dynamics. This paper proposes two fuzzy rule based algorithms for smoothing the control input. The merits of these fuzzy smoothing control algorithms are illustrated by two examples: a semiactive suspension system based on optimal control and a direct drive robot arm under discrete time sliding mode control. The controller design for these two examples is a blend of traditional control theoretic approaches and fuzzy rule based approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Smoothing methods","Variable structure systems","Sliding mode control","Control systems","Fuzzy control","Optimal control","State-space methods","Switches","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure systems","fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure systems","VSS","boundary manifolds","high frequency dynamics","fuzzy smoothing control algorithms","semiactive suspension system","optimal control","direct drive robot arm","discrete time sliding mode control","fuzzy rule based approaches"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.324807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/7733/00324807.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.324807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy smoothing algorithms for variable structure systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy smoothing algorithms for variable structure systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324807/","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4799442","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy smoothing algorithms for variable structure systems","sourcePdf":"00324807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056716S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"65","articleId":"324807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":324808,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Chun-Yi Su","id":"37281254400"},{"name":"Y.

Global asymptotic stability of the algorithm is established in the Lyapunov sense, with tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of zero.

This cost is not constant, but depends on data transfers needed as a result of the move. Therefore, determining a minimum-cost assignment of machines to program segments is not straightforward. A previously presented block-based mode selection (BBMS) approach is used as a basis to develop a heuristic method for assigning machines to program segments of data-parallel algorithms.

By partitioning such tasks onto different machines that communicate via high-speed links, each level or stage of processing can be executed simultaneously on the machine to which it is best suited. A fundamental problem with heterogeneous computing, however, is the difficulty of optimally partitioning an application program across the machines. In this paper, we address the problem of partitioning a chain or a tree-structured parallel or pipelined program over a two-processor heterogeneous system and show that it is possible to approximately solve this problem. The algorithm presented in this paper is based on a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Heterogeneous Computing Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/957/7736/00324963.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Heterogeneous Computing Workshop","doi":"10.1109/HCW.1994.324963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HCW.1994.324963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=324963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioning of image processing tasks on heterogeneous computer systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Application software","Concurrent computing","Partitioning algorithms","Computer vision","Pipeline processing","Classification tree analysis","Parallel processing","Image recognition","Parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","distributed algorithms","resource allocation","tree data structures","parallel programming","pipeline processing","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing task partitioning","heterogeneous computer systems","computer vision task decomposition","high speed links","simultaneous execution","optimal program partitioning","tree-structured program","parallel program","pipelined program","polynomial time approximation scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning of image processing tasks on heterogeneous computer systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4687772","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-26 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning of image processing tasks on heterogeneous computer systems","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00324963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035595S","chronDate":"26 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"957","citationCount":"2","articleId":"324963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":324966,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed model is based on the Cluster-M heterogeneous programming paradigm. Using Cluster-M, an application task is represented in form of a Cluster-M specification which indicates all the concurrent and communicating subtasks at every step of computation. These specifications are then to be mapped onto the underlying heterogeneous suite of computers represented in a Cluster-M representation format. To map every step of Cluster-M specification onto the Cluster-M representation of the heterogeneous suite, we propose to use an optimal synthesis technique called SOS (synthesis of systems). We formulate and solve each of the mapping steps in the form of a mixed integer linear programming model. This leads to a very fast sub-optimal selection and mapping solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/324968/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4687767","conferenceDate":"26-26 April 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sub-optimal assignment of application tasks onto heterogeneous systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-optimal assignment of application tasks onto heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"00324968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045934S","chronDate":"26 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"957","citationCount":"4","articleId":"324968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":324969,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The GOST model allows nonoptimal choices of machines, as in augmented OST (AOST), and heterogeneous code blocks, as in heterogeneous OST (HOST), and incorporates communication time, system reconfiguration time, and data reformatting time (needed when data is exchanged between heterogeneous processors). Under the GOST model, we address the problem of matching/scheduling dependency graphs on a heterogeneous suite of computers. For arbitrary dependency graphs, matching/scheduling is NP-complete.

Simulation results comparing the performance of IPDA-FR with the IPDA algorithm are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325012","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325012.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"917 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated probabilistic data association in clutter with finite resolution sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Integrated probabilistic data association in clutter with finite resolution sensor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated probabilistic data association in clutter with finite resolution sensor","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031835S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"2","articleId":"325012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":325034,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is the first such application of the formula in time-varying systems. This problem was disowned by many investigators due to its complexity in formulations. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it requires neither the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial or eigenvalues of the original system, nor the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the transformed system.

The MMAE uses a bank of Kalman filters that predict the aircraft response to a given input, with each model based on a different failure hypothesis, and then forms the residual difference between the predicted and actual sensor measurements for each filter. The MMAE uses these residuals to determine the probabilities of the failures that are modeled by each of the Kalman filters. Initially the MMAE identified most failures within one second and all within four seconds of onset, but with various performance improvement techniques, the identification time was reduced to less than two seconds. The techniques that will be described are removal of \"/spl beta/ dominance\" effects, bounding the hypothesis conditional probabilities, retuning the Kalman filters, increasing the scalar penalty for measurement residuals, decreased probability smoothing, and increased residual propagation. The noted performance improvement was mostly due to removing the \"/spl beta/ dominance\" effects, lower bounding the hypothesis conditional probabilities, increasing the scalar penalty for measurement residuals, and retuning of the Kalman filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325104","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325104.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","startPage":"462","endPage":"468 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance enhancement of a multiple model adaptive estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=325104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancement of a multiple model adaptive estimator","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325104/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758778","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancement of a multiple model adaptive estimator","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031284S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"11","articleId":"325104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":325137,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

Assuming that the controller will be implemented digitally, processor requirements such as computational capability memory, and I/O speed must be determined. To assess these requirements, it is useful to understand how processor capabilities affect the stability and achievable performance of the closed-loop system, including intersample behavior. Although it seems reasonable to conjecture that closed-loop performance improves as processor speed increases, there exist relatively few results that rigorously document this fact. The purpose of this paper is to make significant progress in this direction by means of a control-design procedure that precisely quantifies the dependence of achievable closed-loop performance on sample rate. The goal of this paper is to develop a sampled-data design methodology that accounts precisely for all sampling effects including intersample behavior. A unique feature of the authors' approach is its unified treatment of both continuous-time and discrete-time controllers. Thus, by appropriate choice of analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) devices, the authors expect to recover continuous-time controller performance as the sample interval h approaches zero and open-loop performance as h approaches infinity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325137","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325137.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"330 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exact treatment of the achievable closed-loop H/sub 2/ performance of sampled-data controllers: from continuous-time to open-loop","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"An exact treatment of the achievable closed-loop H/sub 2/ performance of sampled-data controllers: from continuous-time to open-loop","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4758745","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact treatment of the achievable closed-loop H/sub 2/ performance of sampled-data controllers: from continuous-time to open-loop","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028575S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"2","articleId":"325137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":325140,"authors":[{"name":"Tongwen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Elect. & Comp.

The Quaternion-Fourier transformation, defined in this work, associates two dimensional linear time-invariant (2D-LTI) systems of partial differential equations with the geometry of a sphere. This transform provides a generalized gain-phase frequency response analysis technique. It shows full utility in the algebraic reduction of 2D-LTI systems described by the double convolution of their Green's functions. The standard two dimensional complex Fourier transfer function has a phase associated with each frequency axis and does not describe clearly how each axis interacts with the other. The Quaternion-Fourier transfer function gives an exact measure of this interaction by a single phase angle that may be used as a measure of the relative stability of the system. This extended Fourier transformation provides an exquisite tool for the analysis of 2D-LTI systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325510","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","startPage":"1830","endPage":"1841 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternion-Fourier transforms for analysis of two-dimensional linear time-invariant partial differential systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=325510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quaternion-Fourier transforms for analysis of two-dimensional linear time-invariant partial differential systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325510/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4778841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternion-Fourier transforms for analysis of two-dimensional linear time-invariant partial differential systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089916S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"87","articleId":"325510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":325522,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Chang Yang","id":"37655471800"},{"name":"K.

The authors propose a scheme which guides and controls the longitudinal motion of the pursuit vehicle so as to reach the target gap at the merging point. This scheme ensures that the vehicles not only intercept the gap, but also do so smoothly by matching their speeds. The authors assume that the absolute longitudinal position and speed of the pursuit vehicle and its target gap can be monitored or estimated continuously for feedback. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions are given so that pursuability of a target gap by an entering vehicle can be determined.

The author formulates the problem in the setting of generalized semi-Markov schemes. The author views the system as an input-output system, where the input is a sequence of event lifetimes, and the output is the resulting sequence of states, events, and transition epochs. The system is observed via an observation map. The author addresses the problem from the point of view of inversion, defined as the extraction of event lifetimes from observations of the output. The extracted event lifetimes are used to drive parallel simulations of alternative systems, thereby generating multiple sample paths simultaneously. The author discusses necessary and sufficient conditions for invertibility of the system. The author also considers the problem of implementing his inversion algorithm in parallel, by decomposition of the state transition structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325591","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325591.pdf","startPage":"2205","endPage":"2210 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the construction of sample paths of discrete event systems in parallel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"On the construction of sample paths of discrete event systems in parallel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771919","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the construction of sample paths of discrete event systems in parallel","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027539S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"4","articleId":"325591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":325602,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This is done for a maneuvering aircraft in a tracking control scenario where a horizontal tail failure is encountered. Critical stability and control derivatives are continuously identified using a constrained least squares approach. Prior information on the parameters is incorporated in the constraints. The identified derivatives are used by a Hopfield network, where the systems dynamics are incorporated using a penalty function. The Hopfield network generates an optimal model following open-loop control law. The optimization is performed every time cycle, thus yielding feedback control. The Hopfield neuromorphic approach, due to its massively parallel architecture, holds great promise for fast computations in analog hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325602","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325602.pdf","startPage":"2272","endPage":"2277 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line optimizing networks for reconfigurable control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=325602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325602/","displayDocTitle":"On-line optimizing networks for reconfigurable control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4771930","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line optimizing networks for reconfigurable control","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052697S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"14","articleId":"325602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":325616,"authors":[{"name":"G.N.

This paper presents an approach based on estimating a controller without building or assuming a model for the system. Such an approach has potential advantages in, e.g., accommodating systems with time-varying dynamics. The controller is constructed through use of a function approximator (FA), such as a neural network or polynomial. This involves the estimation of the unknown parameters within the FA. However, since no functional form is being assumed for the system equations, the gradient of the loss function for use in standard optimization algorithms is not available. Therefore, this paper considers the use of a stochastic approximation algorithm that is based on a simultaneous perturbation gradient approximation, which requires only system measurements (not a system model). It is shown that this algorithm can greatly enhance the efficiency over more standard stochastic approximation algorithms based on finite-difference gradient approximations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4772032","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-free control of general discrete-time systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-free control of general discrete-time systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041882S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"15","articleId":"325704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":325706,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The recurrent neural networks can be applied to memorize robotic motions, i.e. trajectory of a manipulator. For this purpose, it is necessary to determine appropriate interconnection weights of the network. Formerly, learning algorithms based on gradient search techniques have been shown. However, it is difficult for the recurrent neural network to learn such functions while using previous approaches because of much computing requirement and limitation of memory. This paper presents a new learning scheme for the recurrent neural networks by genetic algorithm (GA). The GA is applied to determine interconnection weights of the recurrent neural networks. The GA approach is compared with the backpropagation through time which is a famous learning algorithm for the recurrent neural networks.

In this paper, it is shown that there exist orthogonal functions that, in a natural way, are generated by stable linear dynamical systems, and that compose an orthonormal basis for the signal space l/sub 2//sup n/. To this end use is made of balanced realizations of inner transfer functions. The orthogonal functions can be considered as generalizations of, e.g., the Laguerre functions and the pulse functions, related to the use of the delay operator, and give rise to an alternative series expansion of rational transfer functions. It is shown how we can exploit these generalized basis functions to increase the speed of convergence in a series expansion, i.e. to obtain a good approximation by retaining only a finite number of expansion coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4772043","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","displayDocTitle":"A generalized orthonormal basis for linear dynamical systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized orthonormal basis for linear dynamical systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048141S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"14","articleId":"325715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":325737,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

A novel feature of the network is the introduction of a bias vector. The network is operated in the high-gain region of the sigmoidal nonlinearities. The following comprehensive theorem is proved: For all sufficiently small bias vectors except those belonging to a set of measure zero, for all sufficiently large sigmoidal gain, for all initial conditions except those belonging to a set of measure zero, the state of the network converges to a local minimum of the objective function.

This all-pass H/sub /spl infin// gain-designing approach is purely based on the decoupled SISO transfer function analysis of the robotic motion. To make the robotic manipulator more versatile and trainable, a neural-network-based direct adaptive scheme is introduced in addition to the all-pass filters.

Hence, identification of the source of variations and variation reduction are difficult and time consuming tasks. Under the assumption that the process design is capable of producing the product with the target value, this paper employs the adaptive control approach proposed by Spall and Cristion (1992) in reducing deviation of output value around its target value. The goal is to examine the performance of the above control approach for a production process whose underlying structure is unknown and may change during the production process. The study assumes that: operations managers first employ statistical monitoring steps to identify the operating factors that have significant effect on the output value. Then they employ the above adaptive control to readjust the level of those factors to reduce the deviation of output. The controller of the adaptive control approach is a feedforward neural network (NN). The approach uses simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation to estimate the weights of the neural network. The NN controller does not need knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the system and does not require that one build a model for the dynamics. Further, it accounts for the process noise. The findings of the simulation study provide encouraging news for practitioners.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325802","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3242 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325802.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and quality control when the process dynamics are unknown","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325802/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and quality control when the process dynamics are unknown","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4772125","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and quality control when the process dynamics are unknown","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088325S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"1","articleId":"325802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":325804,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The development of a neural network-based scheme for adaptively implementing a variable structure controller (VSC) to drive a flexible manipulator arm is described in this paper. The controller provides a satisfactory suppression of the tip vibrations while facilitating a rapid hub rotation for executing motions during which payload variations can occur. An efficient integration of the operational strong features of a trained neural network and a VSC is made in the development of the overall control scheme. On the one hand, the high degree of inherent robustness of the VSC serves to reduce the architectural and training complexity of the neural network, while on the other, the faster processing capability of the neural network is exploited for on-line payload identification and adaptive implementation of the VSC. The resulting control strategy is novel and is significantly different from the popularly discussed approaches for using neural networks for controller designs (such as the inverse dynamics approach).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325804/","accessionNumber":"4772127","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive variable structure control of flexible manipulators by neural network payload identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive variable structure control of flexible manipulators by neural network payload identification","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054869S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"2","articleId":"325804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":325805,"authors":[{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Derong Liu","id":"37087145985"},{"name":"A.N.

Our results have important implications for the nonlinear robust stabilization problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Stochastic systems","Robust control","Robustness","Adaptive systems","Systems engineering and theory","Risk analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear systems","feedback","differential equations","game theory","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential games","continuous-time nonlinear systems","output feedback risk-sensitive stochastic control","large deviation limits","deterministic output feedback differential game","nonlinear robust stabilization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.1993.325833","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 32nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/1070/7738/00325833.pdf","startPage":"3357","endPage":"3360 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1993.325833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output feedback risk-sensitive control and differential games for continuous-time nonlinear systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=325833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Output feedback risk-sensitive control and differential games for continuous-time nonlinear systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325833/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4772156","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output feedback risk-sensitive control and differential games for continuous-time nonlinear systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00325833.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039141S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1070","citationCount":"25","articleId":"325833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":325843,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Each server has infinite capacity. The arrival process is general and the service times are assumed to be i.i.d. exponential random variables. Using sample path arguments, we show that, given any Bernoulli policy /spl pi/, there exists another policy /spl rho/ which out-performs /spl pi/ by using a randomized version of a round-robin policy. Moreover, /spl rho/ is easily specified and implemented. We present extensions of our results to systems with finite capacities and service times that have an increasing hazard rate.

The developed technique is applied to the identification of a dynamic system and compared with conventional feedforward artificial neural network identifier. Results exhibit an improvement in the quality of the identification model and an increase in the rate of convergence. As a practical application, a prior information is utilized for identification of switched reluctance motor characteristics on the basis of experimental measurements.

The delay-Doppler resolution performance of a model-based matched filter and a conventional matched filter are examined against data obtained in an opening range experiment at a deep water site west of Sardinia in February 1990. The transmitted signals were time-dispersed by propagation through a near-surface waveguide and were Doppler shifted (time-expanded) by relative motion of the towed source and receiving array. The received signals were correlated with a family of reference signals accounting for both medium and Doppler effects. The medium Green's function was modelled using generalized ray theory, and sound speed data measured in situ. Results demonstrate that both the range and relative velocity of the source and receiver were determined correctly if the medium-induced distortion had been modelled properly. Model-based matched filter processing improved the peak output signal-to-noise ratio by 1 to 4 dB for the range-dependent propagation conditions of the experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1993.325994","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","startPage":"I306","endPage":"I311 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1993.325994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739","pdfPath":"/iel2/1081/7739/00325994.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Delay","Distortion measurement","Sea measurements","Acoustic propagation","Oceans","Dispersion","Signal resolution","Acoustic waveguides","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanographic techniques","underwater sound","acoustic variables measurement","acoustic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocean","sea","underwater sound","acoustic measurement technique","model-based matched filter processing","delay-Doppler measurement","multipath dispersive ocean channel","large time-bandwidth product signal","acoustic transmission method","propagation","delay-Doppler resolution","Mediterranean","near-surface waveguide","Doppler shifted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-based matched filter processing for delay-Doppler measurement in a multipath dispersive ocean channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/325994/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4764187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based matched filter processing for delay-Doppler measurement in a multipath dispersive ocean channel","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00325994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027834S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"7739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1081","citationCount":"3","articleId":"325994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":326005,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

High performance synthetic aperture radars (SARs) are now in routine use, both on airborne and space-based platforms. However, despite its conceptual origin coinciding with SAR, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) has received only limited demonstration, and none of these has approached the limits of resolution and range permitted by the underwater environment (e.g. 2 in resolution over a 2000 ft swath). This is largely a consequence of the more stringent motion compensation requirements for SAS relative to SAR, and the severe phase fluctuations induced by the underwater medium. As the performance of SARs continues to be improved, processing and autofocusing algorithms have been developed that promise to alleviate the difficulties of SAS. Using a high fidelity, end-to-end simulation, the authors demonstrate that available SAR autofocusing algorithms can compensate the residual motion compensation errors and medium-induced phase errors that are inevitable for high performance SAS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326018","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/1081/7739/00326018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739","startPage":"I125","endPage":"I131 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation feasibility for high resolution synthetic aperture sonar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation feasibility for high resolution synthetic aperture sonar","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326018/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4764163","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation feasibility for high resolution synthetic aperture sonar","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00326018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031109S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"7739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1081","citationCount":"10","articleId":"326018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326070,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This process can be implemented as a conventional beamformer leading to estimates of the direction of arrival of the echoes for each time sample. The process is inadequate in resolving closely spaced synchronous returns and the accuracy of these estimates is proportional to the number of acoustic data samples used in the process. To improve the angular resolution the authors have considered a number of high-resolution algorithms well known in power spectral estimation applications: autoregressive techniques (i.e. Yule-Walker, and unconstrained least squares), minimum variance methods (i.e. Capon's method), and eigenanalysis algorithms (i.e. MUSIC). Comparisons of results obtained with realistic multibeam sonar simulations show that these algorithms have higher accuracy and better potential for high-resolution bathymetry than the conventional beamformer under nominal SNR levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326070","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/1081/7739/00326070.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326070","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","startPage":"II/77","endPage":"II/82 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of high-resolution beamforming to multibeam swath bathymetry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Application of high-resolution beamforming to multibeam swath bathymetry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326070/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4805874","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of high-resolution beamforming to multibeam swath bathymetry","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00326070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036467S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"7739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1081","citationCount":"5","articleId":"326070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326104,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Besides requirements in computational time, large adaptive filters operating under computationally efficient algorithms imply increased sensitivity to numerical errors and large noise enhancement, which limit their performance at high signalling rates. To overcome these difficulties, a receiver is proposed which consists of a multi-input multi-output combiner in which many input channels are coherently combined into a smaller number, suitable for subsequent multichannel decision-feedback equalization. Receiver operations are optimized jointly to ensure minimum mean-squared error detector performance. Experimental results obtained on a long-range shallow water channel with data rates up to 2000 bits per second demonstrate the receiver capability to fully exploit the spatial diversity of underwater multipath while keeping the receiver complexity at a minimum, thus allowing both fast convergence and little noise enhancement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326227","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","pdfPath":"/iel2/1081/7739/00326227.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326227","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","startPage":"III426","endPage":"III431 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity simultaneous beamforming and equalization for underwater acoustic communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity simultaneous beamforming and equalization for underwater acoustic communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326227/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4811971","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity simultaneous beamforming and equalization for underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00326227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030958S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"7739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1081","citationCount":"16","articleId":"326227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326228,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although considerable successes have been achieved, a critical issue in this domain is the lack of reliable 2D image models from which segmentation and related processing can consistently proceed. The authors describe a nonparametric algorithm for the segmentation of seafloor sidescan imagery (SSI) based on a combination of Markov random fields and multiple layer perceptrons (MLP). SSI, which is considerably noisy and textured, is embodied by a hierarchy of Gibbs distributions. Segmentation of SSI is then considered as a maximum a posteriori estimation. To obtain better estimates of local likelihoods, an MLP is adopted for learning the distribution of observations from training data. Experimental results using data from a Pacific midocean ridge area are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326232","pdfPath":"/iel2/1081/7739/00326232.pdf","startPage":"III456","endPage":"III461 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of OCEANS '93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1993.326232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of seafloor sidescan imagery using Markov random fields and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of seafloor sidescan imagery using Markov random fields and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4805936","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of seafloor sidescan imagery using Markov random fields and neural networks","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00326232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043488S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 1993","isNumber":"7739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1081","citationCount":"6","articleId":"326232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":326411,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

Central to this progress has been the development of new speech coders capable of producing high-quality speech at low data rates. Most of these coders incorporate mechanisms to: represent the spectral properties of speech, provide for speech waveform matching, and \"optimize\" the coder's performance for the human ear. A number of these coders have already been adopted in national and international cellular telephony standards. The objective of this paper is to provide a tutorial overview of speech coding methodologies with emphasis on those algorithms that are part of the recent low-rate standards for cellular communications. Although the emphasis is on the new low-rate coders, we attempt to provide a comprehensive survey by covering some of the traditional methodologies as well. We feel that this approach will not only point out key references but will also provide valuable background to the beginner. The paper starts with a historical perspective and continues with a brief discussion on the speech properties and performance measures. We then proceed with descriptions of waveform coders, sinusoidal transform coders, linear predictive vocoders, and analysis-by-synthesis linear predictive coders. Finally, we present concluding remarks followed by a discussion of opportunities for future research.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.326413","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/7743/00326413.pdf","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.326413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech coding: a tutorial review","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326413","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326413/","displayDocTitle":"Speech coding: a tutorial review","volume":"82","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798912","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech coding: a tutorial review","sourcePdf":"00326413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046739S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"154","articleId":"326413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":326467,"authors":[{"name":"Yijia Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Yijia Cao","id":"37065867500"},{"name":"Lin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"lastName":"Lin Jiang","id":"37650829200"},{"name":"Shijie Cheng","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"lastName":"Shijie Cheng","id":"37086974746"},{"name":"Deshu Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

The control objective is to track and extract maximum power from the wind energy system and transfer this power to the electric utility. This is achieved by controlling the firing delay angle of the inverter. Since the diode bridge rectifier has no control on the DC link voltage, a supplementary control loop is used to limit the voltage within a preset voltage threshold. The proposed scheme for regulating the flow of power through the DC link ensures reduced reactive power burden on the self-excitation capacitor banks and better utilisation of available wind energy, while limiting the DC link voltage within a preset voltage threshold.

Extensive experimental work agrees with the theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.326478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/7745/00326478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.326478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7745","startPage":"572","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaft signals of salient-pole synchronous machines for eccentricity and shorted-field-coil detections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shaft signals of salient-pole synchronous machines for eccentricity and shorted-field-coil detections","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","accessionNumber":"4793015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shaft signals of salient-pole synchronous machines for eccentricity and shorted-field-coil detections","sourcePdf":"00326478.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050137S","chronDate":"Sep 1994","isNumber":"7745","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"36","articleId":"326478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":326479,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper, mathematical reasoning is combined with maximum-likelihood estimation from actual SSFR data to show that, for network structures preserving the main-field magnetizing impedance, the differential leakage contributes significantly to the dynamic response and proves mandatory for adequately modeling rotor impedance.

We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an appropriate metric in the configuration space R/sup 2//spl times/S/sup 1/ of the robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that the new induced topology and the classical one are the same. Although we concentrate upon the car-like robot, the generalization of these techniques leads to new theoretical issues involving sub-Riemannian geometry and to practical results for nonholonomic motion planning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.326564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/7747/00326564.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.326564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion planner for nonholonomic mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A motion planner for nonholonomic mobile robots","volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4803577","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion planner for nonholonomic mobile robots","sourcePdf":"00326564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066588S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"414","articleId":"326564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326566,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The goal of this paper is to build a superior master-slave system that can provide good maneuverability. We first analyze a one degree-of-freedom system including operator and object dynamics. Second, some ideal responses of master-slave systems are defined and a quantitative index of maneuverability is given, based on the concept of ideal responses. Third, we propose new control schemes of master-slave manipulators that provide the ideal kinesthetic coupling such that the operator can maneuver the system as though he/she were directly manipulating the remote object himself/herself. The proposed control scheme requires accurate dynamic models of the master and slave arms, but neither parameters of the remote object nor the operator dynamics is necessary. Finally, the proposed control scheme is introduced to a prototype master-slave system and the experimental results show the validity of the proposed scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.326566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/7747/00326566.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.326566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral control of master-slave manipulators for ideal kinesthetic coupling-formulation and experiment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326566/","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral control of master-slave manipulators for ideal kinesthetic coupling-formulation and experiment","volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4803579","pubMedId":"11539289","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral control of master-slave manipulators for ideal kinesthetic coupling-formulation and experiment","sourcePdf":"00326566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049005S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"711","articleId":"326566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":326567,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Yang","id":"37087072712"},{"name":"Yangsheng Xu","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yangsheng Xu","id":"37087147611"},{"name":"C.S.

HMM is feasible to characterize a doubly stochastic process-measurable action and immeasurable mental states-that is involved in the skill learning. We formulated the learning problem as a multidimensional HMM and developed a testbed for a variety of skill learning applications. Based on \"the most likely performance\" criterion, the best action sequence can be selected from all previously measured action data by modeling the skill as an HMM. The proposed method has been implemented in the teleoperation control of a space station robot system, and some important implementation issues have been discussed.

We make use of the algebraic properties of the system and the symbolic formulation used for reducing the problem to solving a univariate polynomial. However, the polynomial is expressed as a matrix determinant and its roots are computed by reducing to an eigenvalue problem. The other roots of the multivariate system are obtained by computing eigenvectors and substitution. The algorithm involves symbolic preprocessing, matrix computations and a variety of other numerical techniques. The average running time of the algorithm, for most cases, is 11 milliseconds on an IBM RS/6000 workstation.

To verify the advantages of the method, experimental results are shown for the trajectory control of a 2-DOF direct-drive arm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4803586","volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive robust control of robot manipulators-theory and experiment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive robust control of robot manipulators-theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00326574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036781S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"33","articleId":"326574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":326576,"authors":[{"name":"F.C.

If the number of transducers is large, such centralized control systems require considerable computational power and cabling. In this paper, the stability and performance of decentralized adaptive feedforward systems are considered, in which a number of smaller adaptive controllers are implemented independently, each driving subsets of all the secondary sources to minimize the sum of squared outputs of subsets of the error sensors. The limit of this philosophy is when each secondary source is adjusted to minimize the output of only one error sensor. A general theoretical analysis of such decentralized feedforward controllers is developed. It is also shown that a simple condition can be derived, using the Gerschgorin circle theorem, which provides a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for the stability of the overall system. Unfortunately, this condition appears to be rather conservative for larger systems. Examples of the application of this general analysis are presented for two and three channel active sound control systems operating in free space and a 32-channel sound control system operating in an enclosure. Provided the error sensors are closer to the secondary source used to control them than the other secondary sources, the stability of the control system is seen to be quite robust to decentralization. The steady-state performance is also similar to that of a fully coupled control system, although the transient response generally involves oscillatory modes, which sometimes decay only rather slowly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/7749/00326611.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.326611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.326611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interaction between multiple feedforward active control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Error correction","Sensor systems","Centralized control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Robust stability","Transducers","Adaptive systems","Feedforward systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability","transient response","decentralised control","adaptive control","stability criteria","control system analysis","acoustic variables control","acoustic noise","noise abatement","acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple feedforward active control systems","centralized feedforward techniques","multiple secondary sources","multiple error sensors","stability","decentralized adaptive feedforward systems","Gerschgorin circle theorem","active sound control systems","32-channel sound control system","steady-state performance","fully coupled control system","transient response","oscillatory modes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Interaction between multiple feedforward active control systems","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4804657","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interaction between multiple feedforward active control systems","sourcePdf":"00326611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036946S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"51","articleId":"326611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326615,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

This problem was studied exhaustively at Bell Labs between the years of 1918 and 1950 by Harvey Fletcher and his colleagues. The motivation for these studies was to quantify the quality of speech sounds in the telephone plant to both improve speech intelligibility and preference. To do this he and his group studied the effects of filtering and noise on speech recognition accuracy for nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllables, words, and sentences. Fletcher used the term \"articulation\" as the probability of correct recognition for nonsense sounds, and \"intelligibility\" as the probability of correction recognition for words (sounds having meaning). In 1919, Fletcher found a way to transform articulation data for filtered speech into an additive density function D(f) and found a formula that accurately predicts the average articulation. The area under D(S) is called the \"articulation index.\" Fletcher then went on to find relationships between the recognition errors for the nonsense speech sounds, words, and sentences. This work has recently been reviewed and partially replicated by Boothroyd and by Bronkhorst, et al. (1980). Taken as a whole, these studies tell us a great deal about how humans process and recognize speech sounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4799430","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"How do humans process and recognize speech?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How do humans process and recognize speech?","sourcePdf":"00326615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036795S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"221","articleId":"326615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326616,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In some cases, the environmental effect can be modeled by a set of simple transformations and, in particular, by convolution with an environmental impulse response and the addition of some environmental noise. Often, the temporal properties of these environmental effects are quite different from the temporal properties of speech. We have been experimenting with filtering approaches that attempt to exploit these differences to produce robust representations for speech recognition and enhancement and have called this class of representations relative spectra (RASTA). In this paper, we review the theoretical and experimental foundations of the method, discuss the relationship with human auditory perception, and extend the original method to combinations of additive noise and convolutional noise.

This paper describes a low-vocabulary speech recognition algorithm that provides robust performance in noisy environments with particular emphasis on characteristics due to the Lombard effect. A neutral and stressed-based source generator framework is established to achieve improved speech parameter characterization using a morphological constrained enhancement algorithm and stressed source compensation, which is unique for each source generator across a stressed speaking class. The algorithm uses a noise-adaptive boundary detector to obtain a sequence of source generator classes, which is used to direct noise parameter enhancement and stress compensation. This allows the parameter enhancement and stress compensation schemes to adapt to changing speech generator types. A phonetic consistency rule is also employed based on input source generator partitioning. Algorithm performance evaluation is demonstrated for noise-free and nine noisy Lombard speech conditions that include additive white Gaussian noise, slowly varying computer fan noise, and aircraft cockpit noise. System performance is compared with a traditional discrete-observation recognizer with no embellishments. Recognition rates are shown to increase from an average 36.7% for a baseline recognizer to 74.7% for the new algorithm (a 38% improvement). The new algorithm is also shown to be more consistent, as demonstrated by a decrease in standard deviation of recognition from 21.1 to 11.9 and a reduction in confusable word-pairs under noisy, Lombard-effect stressed speaking conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4799433","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Morphological constrained feature enhancement with adaptive cepstral compensation (MCE-ACC) for speech recognition in noise and Lombard effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphological constrained feature enhancement with adaptive cepstral compensation (MCE-ACC) for speech recognition in noise and Lombard effect","sourcePdf":"00326618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04204S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"89","articleId":"326618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":326635,"authors":[{"name":"W.B.

Such smallness arises naturally at interfaces of nanometric thickness and will occur also when dielectrics are employed in the nano-technical devices of the future. It already occurs in living systems where the dielectric and conductive properties of biomaterials are vital in sustaining activity. The transverse and lateral properties of interfaces, including the effects of molecular ordering, are considered and it is suggested that the advent of scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies provides a significant opportunity for nanometric dielectric studies. An important feature, suggested for future exploitation, is the cross-coupling in interfaces of force fields arising from electrical, mechanical, chemical and entropic potential gradients. Application of these concepts to biology and to the behavior of polymer gels which may lead to development of muscle-like actuators and transducers are considered. Finally, attention is drawn to the likely role of nanometric interfacial processes in the initiation of electrical breakdown in insulating materials.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.326653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/7750/00326653.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"825","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00326653.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.326653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanometric dielectrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326653/","displayDocTitle":"Nanometric dielectrics","volume":"1","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4813044","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanometric dielectrics","sourcePdf":"00326653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046587S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"524","articleId":"326653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":326654,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is based on Curie's empirical law of 1889 which states that the current through a capacitor is i(t)=U/sub 0//(h/sub 1/t/sup n/), where h/sub 1/ and n are constants, U/sub 0/ is the dc voltage applied at t=0, and 0<n<1. It implies that the insulation resistance is R/sub i/(t)=h/sub 1/t/sup n/, that is, it increases almost in proportion to time since n nearly equals 1.0. For a general input voltage u(t) the current is i(t)=Cd/sup n/u(t)/dt/sup n/ where use is made of the fractional derivative, defined by means of its Laplace transform. The model gives rise to a capacitor impedance Z(i/spl omega/=1/[(i/spl omega/)/sup n/C], with a loss tangent that is independent of frequency. The model has other properties: the capacitor 'remembers' voltages it has been subjected to earlier, dielectric absorption is an example of this. Capacitor problems require solving integral equations. The model is dynamic, i.e. electrostatic processes are simply slow dynamic processes. The model is applied to several problems that cannot be treated with conventional theory.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/94.326654","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00326654.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.326654","startPage":"826","endPage":"839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/7750/00326654.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitor theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Capacitor theory","volume":"1","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4813045","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitor theory","sourcePdf":"00326654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031452S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"455","articleId":"326654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":326657,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Aircraft organizations are aware of this phenomenon and have tried to provide solutions to cope with this new wire failure, i.e. modification of cable design and manufacture, avoiding pure polyimide insulation, and development of test methods. As regards space systems, the recognition of this phenomenon with its possible consequences has led to the development of test methods and to the introduction of new wire requirements within the framework of the Columbus Program. The available data do not establish with certainty a correlation between test results obtained for aircraft systems and the behavior expected on spacecraft. The untidy nature of arc tracking has been shown with the different kinds of events reported. In test laboratories, significant variations of results make this failure phenomenon even more difficult to define. From the data summarized in the survey it is apparent that the failure conditions vary with numerous conditions of electrical network, environment, cable design and aging parameters. Whereas the arcing phenomenon is essentially influenced by the environment and network conditions, the susceptibility to tracking is more dependent on the chemical nature of the insulation. Definitions are also presented in the survey to complete the understanding of the phenomenon.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of arc tracking on aerospace cables and wires","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/94.326657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/7750/00326657.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.326657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7750","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Survey of arc tracking on aerospace cables and wires","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4813048","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of arc tracking on aerospace cables and wires","sourcePdf":"00326657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029337S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"27","articleId":"326657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":326666,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Thanks to a redundant table-lookup scheme, recovering database items that match a test sequence requires minimal data access.

In this article, we present an approach for retrieving homologies in databases of proteins.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/99.326666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/99/7751/00326666.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/99.326666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Searching in parallel for similar strings [biological sequences]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  1994","displayDocTitle":"Searching in parallel for similar strings [biological sequences]","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 1994","accessionNumber":"4721774","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Searching in parallel for similar strings [biological sequences]","sourcePdf":"00326666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06585S","chronDate":"Summer  1994","isNumber":"7751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"99","citationCount":"11","articleId":"326666","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":326669,"authors":[{"name":"E.

While many tried to create PSEs over the next few years, by the early 1970s they had abandoned almost all of these attempts. Technology could not yet support PSEs in computational science. But the dream of the 1960s can be the reality of the 1990s: high-performance computers combined with better understanding of computing and computational science have put PSEs well within our reach. The term 'problem-solving environment' means different things to different people. A PSE is a computer system that provides all the computational facilities necessary to solve a target class of problems. These features include advanced solution methods, automatic or semi-automatic selection of solution methods, and ways to easily incorporate novel solution methods. Simple PSEs appeared early in computing without being recognized as such. Some of the capabilities of future problem-solving environments seem like science fiction, but whatever form they eventually take, their scientific and economic impact will be enormous.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00326669.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/99/7751/00326669.pdf","doi":"10.1109/99.326669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/99.326669","startPage":"11","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer as thinker/doer: problem-solving environments for computational science","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326669/","displayDocTitle":"Computer as thinker/doer: problem-solving environments for computational science","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4721770","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Summer 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer as thinker/doer: problem-solving environments for computational science","sourcePdf":"00326669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.285834S","chronDate":"Summer  1994","isNumber":"7751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"99","citationCount":"186","articleId":"326669","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":326817,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

It consists of five processors: four neuron processors interconnected in a ring, each are computing several states of different GBP neurons, and a LVQ processor used to compute the states of the LVQ neurons. Connections between GBP neurons folded on the same processor are implemented in each processor by using an address generator based on modulus m counters.

A bridge is a logic node with two inputs and one output. A bridge or a bridge pair are called permissible if they can be inserted into a Boolean network without changing its behavior at primary outputs. There are a total of 255 types of bridges that can be considered between any pair of wires in the network. We discuss a subset of such bridges and present three theorems related to permissible bridges for pairwise detectability, distinguishability and conditional equivalence. Experimental results show that relatively many bridges are permissible in each circuit. In this paper, we exploit the conditional equivalence of wire pairs and show that even after technology mapping, we can significantly reduce the active area as well as the wiring of many designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1994.326893","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of European Design and Test Conference EDAC-ETC-EUROASIC","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of European Design and Test Conference EDAC-ETC-EUROASIC","pdfPath":"/iel2/946/7755/00326893.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDTC.1994.326893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introduction of permissible bridges with application to logic optimization after technology mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Feb-3 Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326893/","displayDocTitle":"Introduction of permissible bridges with application to logic optimization after technology mapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682253","conferenceDate":"28 Feb.-3 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introduction of permissible bridges with application to logic optimization after technology mapping","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00326893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056133S","chronDate":"28 Feb-3 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"946","citationCount":"14","articleId":"326893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":326901,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

The presence of custom hardware for application-specific needs has introduced instruction types which are unfamiliar to the capabilities of traditional compilers. Thus, these traditional techniques can lead to inefficient and sparsely compacted machine microcode. In this paper, we introduce a novel instruction-set matching and selection methodology, based upon a rich representation useful for DSP and mixed control-oriented applications. This representation shows explicit behaviour that references architecture resource classes. This allows a wide range of instructions types to be captured in a pattern set. The pattern set has been organized in a manner such that matching is extremely efficient and retargeting to architectures with new instruction sets is well defined. The matching and selection algorithms have been implemented in a retargetable code generation system called CodeSyn.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instruction-set matching and selection for DSP and ASIP code generation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of European Design and Test Conference EDAC-ETC-EUROASIC","doi":"10.1109/EDTC.1994.326902","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of European Design and Test Conference EDAC-ETC-EUROASIC","pdfPath":"/iel2/946/7755/00326902.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDTC.1994.326902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=326902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/326902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Feb-3 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Instruction-set matching and selection for DSP and ASIP code generation","conferenceDate":"28 Feb.-3 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4682244","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instruction-set matching and selection for DSP and ASIP code generation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00326902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082003S","chronDate":"28 Feb-3 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"946","citationCount":"73","articleId":"326902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":326920,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As well as closed loop plant stability, design objectives often include measures such as rise time, settling time, overshoot, asymptotic tracking, decoupling and regulation, gain and phase margins, small disturbance response and bounds on frequency response magnitudes. Genetic algorithms have previously been shown to be useful in addressing ill-behaved optimization problems, being able to cope with discontinuities, multimodality and uncertain function evaluations, and their single objective formulation has been extended by the authors to include multiple objectives.

When the transfer function of a process is known, the optimization procedure can be used to tune the cascade controller for the given process. From the examples considered, it can be seen that the method usually results in a good closed-loop performance with small overshoot and short settling time for both tuning methods. The performance obtained when determining the controller settings by individual optimisations for each loop is often not far from the true optimum and normally produces satisfactory results. The auto-tuning method can also provide good tuning when the PID controller parameters are tuned by the use of formulae previously proposed by the authors (1993). The advantage of this approach is that it can be used when no mathematical model is available for the process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cascade control","Optimal control","Proportional control","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade control","control system synthesis","optimal control","three-term control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum cascade PID controller design","SISO systems","parameter determination","transfer function","optimization","cascade controller tuning","closed-loop performance"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940201","startPage":"606","endPage":"611 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1994 International Conference on Control - Control '94.","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 International Conference on Control - Control '94.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1169/7757/00327076.pdf","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum cascade PID controller design for SISO systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Optimum cascade PID controller design for SISO systems","accessionNumber":"4696066","publicationDate":"1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"21-24 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum cascade PID controller design for SISO systems","confLoc":"Coventry, UK","sourcePdf":"00327076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.016943S","chronDate":"21-24 March 1994","isNumber":"7757","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1169","citationCount":"14","articleId":"327076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":327110,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

Recent papers have suggested that both techniques could be used to form the model in model-based controller designs. In order to compare the two techniques, the well known Box-Jenkins furnace data were used. The software used to generate the neural networks was 'Neural-Works Explorer', and in-house software was used to generate the fuzzy relational models. The predictive performance of both methods was compared on the dataset for a variety of model configurations. The paper describes the results of these tests and discusses the effects of changing model parameters on predictive and practical performance. For the neural models the factors investigated were: network configuration, transfer function type, and various combinations of learning schemes. The factors considered for the fuzzy relational models were the model structure and reference set definitions. As well as predictive performance criteria, practical modelling criteria such as modelling time, sensitivity, etc., were also used to compare the two methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1049/cp:19940350","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00327272.png","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1452 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1994 International Conference on Control - Control '94.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19940350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7758","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 International Conference on Control - Control '94.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1169/7758/00327272.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of neural networks and fuzzy relational systems in dynamic modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327272/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of neural networks and fuzzy relational systems in dynamic modelling","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4701058","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 March 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of neural networks and fuzzy relational systems in dynamic modelling","confLoc":"Coventry, UK","sourcePdf":"00327272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039432S","chronDate":"21-24 March 1994","isNumber":"7758","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1169","citationCount":"2","articleId":"327272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":327278,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The paper shows that a satisfactory accurate state prediction for the nonlinear dynamic system can be achieved in this way. In the second stage of fault detection and isolation, a neural network is trained to classify characteristics contained in the residuals. Hence, based on the classification given by the network, faults can be detected and isolated.

A hierarchical architecture of the ANN is proposed for the design of the controller, which contains two subnetworks. The first one (NNM) is used for motor identification and the second one (NNC) for adaptive control. Both of these employ error backpropagation rules. It is an advantage of the applied neuro-controller that it does not require a reference model or an inverse model. In the neuro-controller, the identification of the motor is performed by mapping the input-output of the motor, and the adaptation of the controller is obtained by minimising the difference between the reference speed and the mapped speed. A minimum variance self-tuning control is also implemented, and it is compared with the ANN control. The simulation results show that the proposed identification and adaptive control scheme is practically feasible. Details of the practical implementation are discussed, together with important theoretical aspects. The neuro-controller has been successfully implemented in real time using the Texas Instruments TMS320C330 digital signal processor. The minimum variance self-tuning controller has also been implemented on the same DSP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 March 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327322/","accessionNumber":"4700997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network based control of electromechanical systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network based control of electromechanical systems","confLoc":"Coventry, UK","sourcePdf":"00327322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037973S","chronDate":"21-24 March 1994","isNumber":"7758","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1169","citationCount":"5","articleId":"327322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":327337,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Simulation results are very encouraging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327412/","accessionNumber":"4681638","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neufuz: neural network based fuzzy logic design algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neufuz: neural network based fuzzy logic design algorithms","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00327412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030421S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1022","citationCount":"23","articleId":"327412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":327418,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Lee","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Lee","id":"37350509600"},{"name":"H.

The LED displacement sensor is used as a part of the vision system, which is based on the active stereo sensing method. In addition, the sensor's outputs are used for calibrating camera parameters. Therefore, the system can calibrate the camera parameters easily. Neural networks are used to compensate for the output of the image processing system for some errors, such as camera parameter error and lens distortion. By utilizing the neural network, a vision system can be used with as high an accuracy as possible. A sensor integration method based on fuzzy inference is used. The fuzzy inference input consists of information on the change in the sensor output and the position change of the sensor system, together with the environmental data of the measurements. For this integration system, the sensory system can be used accurately.

The (X,Y) pairs then can be used to determine the FLC rules by DCL to find the optimal parameters of the MF, using a multilayer neural network trained by a backpropagation algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1993.327481","pdfPath":"/iel2/1022/7759/00327481.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"250 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1993] Second IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1993] Second IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1993.327481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell state space algorithm and neural network based fuzzy logic controller design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Cell state space algorithm and neural network based fuzzy logic controller design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4677059","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell state space algorithm and neural network based fuzzy logic controller design","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00327481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040417S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1022","citationCount":"1","articleId":"327481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":327494,"authors":[{"name":"A.O.

The controller is applicable to processes with multivariable states and with uncertain or nonlinear dynamics for which analytical models or standard control algorithms are either impractical or cannot be derived. This controller performs a fuzzy discretization of the process state and control variable spaces, and implements fuzzy logic control rules as a fuzzy relation. The membership functions of the fuzzy discretization are adjusted online and the fuzzy control rules are learned using a performance measure as feedback reinforcement. The fuzzy discretization procedure employs a data compression technique permitting multivariable state vector inputs. The controller is implemented with neural networks. Simulation results for the controller applied to a simple dynamical system demonstrate its effectiveness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1993.327494","pdfPath":"/iel2/1022/7759/00327494.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1993] Second IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1993] Second IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1993.327494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy adaptive controller using reinforcement learning neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/327494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy adaptive controller using reinforcement learning neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4677046","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy adaptive controller using reinforcement learning neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00327494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031862S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1022","citationCount":"11","articleId":"327494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":327509,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

Additionally, the architecture has an optimized rule base and its operation time depends only on the resolution. A prototype with two inputs, one output, and a resolution of 8 b has been implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and uses fewer than 10000 gates including internal RAM.

Previously, many researches in delay estimation methods have concentrated on deconvolution, especially on adaptive deconvolution. However, it is well known that the minimum resolvable delay in deconvolution methods is the sampling interval of the original data. Two kinds of high resolution delay estimation methods are presented. One is delay-frequency estimation methods, another is the eigenstructure methods for delay estimation. It is also shown that these two methods can resolve delays spaced closer than one sampling interval. The principle and characteristics of these two methods are described, and computer simulation results are given. Finally, a summarized table is listed to show the performance of various delay estimators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1993.328053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761","startPage":"579","endPage":"583 vol.3","pdfPath":"/iel2/1063/7761/00328053.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of TENCON '93.

The GCNN classifier is based on applying the Gram-Charlier series approximation of probability density functions. The GPNN is based on applying the Gram-Charlier series and Parzen's (1962) windowing technique for approximation of density functions. These classifiers are implemented in parallel architectures. Training of these networks using a modified Kohonen training algorithm is presented. GCNN and GPNN have the advantage of requiring very short training times. Performances of these classifiers for radar target detection are evaluated in terms of probability of detection versus signal-to-noise ratio.

The problem is how to optimally determine the locations to install (or replace, or remove) capacitors, the types and sizes of capacitors to be installed (or replaced) and, during each load level, the control schemes for each capacitor in the nodes of a general three-phase unbalanced distribution system such that a desired objective function is minimized while the load constraints, network constraints and operational constraints (e.g. the voltage profile) at different load levels are satisfied. The objective function considered consists of two terms: cost for energy loss and cost related to capacitor purchase, capacitor installation, capacitor replacement and capacitor removal. Comprehensive modelings of different components are presented which include primary power networks, three-phase transformers (different winding connections, off-nominal tap ratio, core and copper losses), co-generators, voltage sensitive load models for single-phase, two-phase and three-phase loads, shunt capacitors and reactors. The new problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem with a nondifferentiable objective function. The configuration space essential in the design of an annealing-based solution methodology for the new problem is derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328378/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4789458","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal capacitor placement, replacement and control in large-scale unbalanced distribution systems: system modeling and a new formulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal capacitor placement, replacement and control in large-scale unbalanced distribution systems: system modeling and a new formulation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00328378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047585S","chronDate":"10-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1121","citationCount":"3","articleId":"328378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":328391,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A significant example of this situation is given by the operations a line relay must perform in order to detect the type of fault (line-to-ground, line-to-line, line-to-line involving ground). The mathematical theory of fuzzy sets featured many practical applications, mainly in industrial controls, and fuzzy-set processors are available to allow real time applications. This paper shows that a fuzzy-set approach can be useful even in digital relaying, whenever \"fuzzy\" decisions have to be undertaken.

The triggering strategies used by these transient recorders to capture disturbance waveforms are usually based on the violation of a set of predetermined measurement thresholds. Unfortunately, threshold based triggering strategies are difficult to apply in situations when only waveforms corresponding to a given class of disturbances need to be recorded. This inability of the reader to automatically discriminate between waveform types tends to burden the user with the task of manually sifting and sorting through a large number of captured waveforms. This paper describes an artificial neural network methodology for the classification of waveforms that are captured, as part of a larger scheme to automate the data collection process of recorders. Two different neural network paradigms are investigated: the more common feedforward network; and a modification of that, the time-delay network, which has the ability to encode temporal relationships found in the input data and exhibits a translation shift invariance property. Comparisons of both network paradigms, based on a typical distribution circuit configuration, are also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328398/","accessionNumber":"4789462","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-15 April 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The classification of power system disturbance waveforms using a neural network approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The classification of power system disturbance waveforms using a neural network approach","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00328398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060163S","chronDate":"10-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"7764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1121","citationCount":"6","articleId":"328398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":328413,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Circuits are realized in FET-SEED (field-effect transistor self-electrooptic effect device) integration technology, which permits fabrication of GaAs-based FET's, together with normal-incidence multiple-quantum-well detector/modulator devices. Novel features of the circuit include the use of two input signal beams, and the ability to control the input voltage swing with clamping diodes. Two variations of our circuit are found to have input capacitances of 50 or 60 fF. Resultant input optical switching energies depend on the voltage swing, the FET performance, and the input data format, but operation at 200 Mb/s with 40 fJ is demonstrated under ideal conditions with nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) data. Finally, operation of the receiver with pulses that are short compared to the bit period is found to be advantageous as compared to the case of pulses equal to the bit period in length (NRZ format). 650 Mb/s operation is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.328593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7767/00328593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.328593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental sensitivity studies of diode-clamped FET-SEED smart-pixel optical receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Optical receivers","FETs","Optical signal processing","Integrated circuit technology","Optical device fabrication","Quantum well devices","Detectors","Voltage control","Clamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical receivers","field effect integrated circuits","SEEDs","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","sensitivity","integrated optoelectronics","semiconductor quantum wells","electro-optical devices","optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diode-clamped FET-SEED smart-pixel optical receivers","monolithically integrated double-clamped smart-pixel optical receivers","field-effect transistor self-electrooptic effect device integration technology","GaAs-based FET's","normal-incidence multiple-quantum-well detector/modulator devices","input signal beams","input voltage swing","clamping diode","circuit","input capacitances","input optical switching energies","sensitivity studies","FET performance","nonreturn-to-zero data","bit period","pulses","50 fF","60 fF","200 Mbit/s","650 Mbit/s","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Experimental sensitivity studies of diode-clamped FET-SEED smart-pixel optical receivers","volume":"30","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4802600","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328593/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental sensitivity studies of diode-clamped FET-SEED smart-pixel optical receivers","sourcePdf":"00328593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072205S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"31","articleId":"328593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":328628,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A partially depleted transistor was used to solve the floating-body effect, resulting in improved operation. The newly introduced body-synchronized sensing scheme enhances the lower Vcc margin. The p-n junction capacitance between source/drain and a substrate for SOI structure is reduced by 25%. RAS access time tRAC is 70 ns with a 2.7-V power supply, which is as fast as the equivalent bulk-Si device with a 4-V power supply. The active current consumption is 1.1 mA (Vcc=3.0 V, 260-ns cycle) for this SOI-DRAM, which is a reduction of 65%, compared with 3.2 mA for the reference bulk-Si DRAM. The mean value of data retention time for this chip at 80/spl deg/C is longer than 20 s (Vcc=3.3 V), which is the same value as mass-produced 16-Mb DRAM's. The SOI-DRAM has an operating Vcc range from 2.3 V to 4.0 V.

The new verify circuit, which is composed of only two transistors, results in a simple intelligent program algorithm for 3 V-only operation and a reduction of the program time to 56%. This paper also describes a shielded bitline sensing method to reduce a bitline-bitline capacitive coupling noise from 700 mV to 35 mV. The large 700 mV noise without the shielded bitline architecture is mainly caused by the NAND-type cell array structure. A 3 V-only experimental NAND flash memory, developed in a 0.7-/spl mu/m NAND flash memory process technology, demonstrates that the programmed threshold voltages are controlled between 0.4 V and 1.8 V by the new verify circuit.

In the two-stage weighted current array, only 32 master and 32 slave unit current sources are required. Thus silicon area and stray capacitance can be reduced significantly. Experimental results show that a conversion rate of 125 MHz is achievable with differential and integral linearity errors of 0.21 LSB and 0.23 LSB, respectively.

The system hardware elements contain both the analog and the digital components. Transfer functions of the analog circuits are easily identified employing the conventional approach. Gain function of the digital block is however conceived following a quite unconventional route. The digital gain is shown to include the effects of comparator thresholds, digital clock, shift register, sinusoidal amplitude, and ac frequency. The dependence of the digital gain on voltage thresholds, clocking period, and the integrational property of threshold comparator is expected. The dependence on sinusoidal amplitude contradicts the traditional concept of small signal analysis. The overall loop gain in the analytic form yields a computational result that matches the actual measurement very well. This fact proves, to some extent, the validity of the digital gain function and the basis of its derivation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.328763","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"1049","endPage":"1053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/7771/00328763.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.328763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop gain of a spacecraft switched shunt power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Power systems","Clocks","Hardware","Transfer functions","Analog circuits","Shift registers","Frequency","Threshold voltage","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vehicle power plants","transfer functions","amplification","solar cell arrays","solar cells","aerospace computing","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop gain","spacecraft switched shunt power system","digital components","analog components","transfer functions","analog circuits","gain function","digital block","digital gain","comparator thresholds","digital clock","shift register","sinusoidal amplitude","ac frequency","voltage thresholds","clocking period","integrational property","threshold comparator","small signal analysis","overall loop gain","digital gain function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Loop gain of a spacecraft switched shunt power system","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4802576","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328763/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop gain of a spacecraft switched shunt power system","sourcePdf":"00328763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038737S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","articleId":"328763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":328785,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

Unknown parameters appearing in the system equation are either constant or spatially-varying. Distributed sensing and actuation are assumed to be available. Adaptation laws are obtained by the Lyapunov redesign method. It Is shown that the concept of persistency of excitation, which guarantees the parameter error convergence to zero in finite-dimensional adaptive systems, in infinite-dimensional adaptive systems should be investigated in relation to time variable, spatial variable, and also boundary conditions. Unlike the finite-dimensional case, in infinite-dimensional adaptive systems even a constant input is shown to be persistently exciting in the sense that it guarantees the convergence of parameter errors to zero. Averaging theorems for two-time scale systems which involve a finite dimensional slow system and an infinite dimensional fast system are developed. The exponential stability of the adaptive system, which is critical in finite dimensional adaptive control in terms of tolerating disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, is shown by applying averaging.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.328823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7772/00328823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.328823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct adaptive control of parabolic systems: algorithm synthesis and convergence and stability analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct adaptive control of parabolic systems: algorithm synthesis and convergence and stability analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797311","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct adaptive control of parabolic systems: algorithm synthesis and convergence and stability analysis","sourcePdf":"00328823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048499S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"129","articleId":"328823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":328825,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hai Fan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Hai Fan","id":"37654718400"},{"name":"J.L.

This class consists of minimizing the expectation of an exponential cost criterion with quadratic argument subject to a discrete-time Gauss-Markov dynamic system, i.e., the linear-exponential-Gaussian (LEG) control problem. Besides the one-step delayed information pattern previously considered, the classical and the one-step delayed information-sharing (OSDIS) patterns are assumed. After determining the centralized controller based upon the classical information pattern, the optimal decentralized controller based upon the OSDIS pattern and the solution to a static team problem is found to be affine. A unifying approach to determine controllers based upon these three information patterns is obtained by noting that the value of a quadratic exponent of an exponential function is independent of the information structure. Both necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllers to be minimizing are obtained regardless of the exponential form. The negative exponential form is included which is unimodal but not convex.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.328825","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00328825.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7772/00328825.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.328825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1986","endPage":"2003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized and decentralized solutions of the linear-exponential-Gaussian problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Centralized and decentralized solutions of the linear-exponential-Gaussian problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328825/","volume":"39","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797309","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized and decentralized solutions of the linear-exponential-Gaussian problem","sourcePdf":"00328825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041151S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"41","articleId":"328825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":328858,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Explicit results for the entries in the SPICE circuit model are obtained for an incident uniform plane wave that may represent sources such as radio and television transmitters, radars, lightning, etc. The result relies on the transformation of the MTL equations into uncoupled modal lines by similarity transformations. The entries in the similarity transformations are provided for lossless lines. The model is implemented using controlled sources to implement the modal transformations and delay lines to implement the modal lines. If the model is implemented as a SPICE subcircuit model, the time-domain form of the incident field can be implemented as a source external to that subcircuit model so that changes in the line responses due to changes In the incident field waveform can be simulated without changing the subcircuit model. In order to avoid negative line delays, the result is restricted to incident waves having components of the propagation vector in the positive direction along the line. This restriction can be removed by simply reversing the line. The paramount advantages of the model are that both time-domain and frequency-domain results can be easily obtained with the existing SPICE code, and nonlinear loads, such as transistors and digital devices, as well as dynamic loads, such as inductors and capacitors, may be easily incorporated using the existing elements in the SPICE code. Predicted results for MTL's using the method are compared to those of the time-domain to frequency-domain transformation and finite difference-time-domain (FDTD) methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00328864.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/7774/00328864.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.328864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.328864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SPICE model for multiconductor transmission lines excited by an incident electromagnetic field","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SPICE","Multiconductor transmission lines","Time domain analysis","Delay lines","Finite difference methods","Predictive models","Electromagnetic modeling","Voltage","Circuits","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPICE","transmission line theory","electromagnetic field theory","time-domain analysis","frequency-domain analysis","electromagnetic induction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference-time-domain","multiconductor transmission lines","incident electromagnetic field","frequency-domain voltages","frequency-domain currents","time-domain voltages","time-domain currents","EM induction","SPICE circuit model","incident uniform plane wave","television transmitters","radio transmitters","FDTD","lightning","uncoupled modal lines","similarity transformations","lossless lines","controlled sources","modal transformations","delay lines","modal lines","SPICE subcircuit model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A SPICE model for multiconductor transmission lines excited by an incident electromagnetic field","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4842625","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SPICE model for multiconductor transmission lines excited by an incident electromagnetic field","sourcePdf":"00328864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06382S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"99","articleId":"328864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":328878,"authors":[{"name":"Sailing He","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Theory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"lastName":"Sailing He","id":"37067343100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"328878","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Propagation losses","Maxwell equations","Integral equations","Electromagnetic propagation","Transient response","Electromagnetic transients","Electromagnetic modeling","Composite materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission line theory","Maxwell equations","electromagnetic wave propagation","laminates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ETLC model","anisotropic lossy materials","transient propagation","anisotropic laminated composites","transient response","plane wave","multilayered structure","anisotropic lossy material","equivalent transmission-line-circuit","standard circuit analysis program","PSPICE"]}],"abstract":"S.

Lin et al. wanted to calculate the transient response for a plane wave obliquely incident on a multilayered structure consisting of anisotropic lossy materials. They first derived an equivalent transmission-line-circuit (ETLC) model for the anisotropic lossy materials, and then used a standard circuit analysis program (PSPICE) to calculate the transient response. The method is efficient and it enables one to use the existing computer code. However, He believes that the Lin et al. ETLC model for anisotropic lossy materials is not correct. He derives and presents the correct one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The correct ETLC model for anisotropic lossy materials-a comment on \"Transient propagation in anisotropic laminated composites\"","doi":"10.1109/15.328878","startPage":"409","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.328878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/7774/00328878.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"The correct ETLC model for anisotropic lossy materials-a comment on \"Transient propagation in anisotropic laminated composites\"","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4842636","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The correct ETLC model for anisotropic lossy materials-a comment on \"Transient propagation in anisotropic laminated composites\"","sourcePdf":"00328878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034448S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"4","articleId":"328878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":328895,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two methods exist to estimate the waveform from the jittered measurements. One method, called the median method, is based on the calculation of the point-by-point median of a large set of waveform measurements. It is shown here that this method is asymptotically biased if noise is present and if the waveform is nonmonotonic. Another method, called the pdf deconvolution method, is based on an estimation of the jitter probability density function and on a technique to deconvolve this density function from the average of all recorded waveforms. To estimate the jitter probability density function, it is assumed that the waveform has a part which can very well be approximated by a ramp during a time span which is smaller than the standard deviation. It is shown that a significant asymptotic bias is introduced by the method when this assumption is violated. A novel approach is proposed, based on a parametric model of the jitter probability density function, which results in an asymptotic unbiased estimate of the jitter probability density function. The method is experimentally verified, and it is explained why this method is especially useful when one is interested in the Fourier spectrum of the recorded waveform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing jitter","Probability density function","Oscilloscopes","Sampling methods","Deconvolution","Distortion measurement","Density functional theory","Parametric statistics","Additive noise","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform analysis","probability","electric distortion","measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing jitter","distortion","sampled waveforms","equivalent-time sampling oscilloscope","recorded waveform","median method","point-by-point median","pdf deconvolution","probability density function","recorded waveforms","jitter probability density function","standard deviation","asymptotic bias","parametric model","asymptotic unbiased estimate","Fourier spectrum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.328895","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00328895.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/7775/00328895.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.328895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of timing jitter-induced distortion of sampled waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of timing jitter-induced distortion of sampled waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328895/","volume":"43","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4802538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of timing jitter-induced distortion of sampled waveforms","sourcePdf":"00328895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037367S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"25","articleId":"328895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":328897,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The field equations for the following terminations are worked out: (1) the sample extends to /spl infin/ in the positive axial direction, (2) the sample is backed by a well-characterized material, and (3) the sample is backed by a short-circuit termination. The equations are valid for both dielectric and magnetic materials. The model allows the study of the open-ended coaxial probe as a nondestructive testing tool. The analysis allows a study of the effects of air gaps on probe measurements. The reflection coefficient and phase are studied as a function of lift-off, coaxial line size, permittivity, permeability, and frequency. Numerical results indicate that the probe is very sensitive to lift-off. For medium to high permittivity values and electrically small probes, gaps on the order of fractions of a millimeter strongly influence the reflection coefficient. In order for the field to penetrate through the air gap, larger size coaxial line or higher frequencies need to be used. A comparison of the theory to experiment is presented. The results are in close agreement.

Application of these techniques is in fast fading, power efficient channels, typical of the mobile radio environment. Computer simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that with these baseband waveshaping techniques, carrier envelope fluctuations are significantly reduced, and the out-of-band power after nonlinear amplification is suppressed by up to 20 dB compared to /spl pi//4 QPSK. In frequency noninterleaved land or satellite mobile radio systems operating in a nonlinear, fading and ACI (adjacent channel interference) environment, these techniques may achieve 20%-50% higher spectral efficiency compared to /spl pi//4 QPSK.

The authors attempt a joint acquisition of both the time delay and the distorting Doppler velocity. They consider the case where the ratio of platform to propagation velocity, v/sub r//c is large enough to generate time compression of the pseudo-noise (PN) sequence itself. A Doppler effect of this type may be encountered in underwater acoustic or intersatellite communications. The simultaneous presence of the unknown Doppler shift and timing necessitates a substantial modification of conventional acquisition strategies. A two-dwell system, using a short duration correlation to acquire the timing information, with a subsequent longer correlation to acquire the Doppler velocity is proposed. The joint acquisition process is modeled by a finite state Markov chain, and the performance of the system is characterized by the mean and variance of the acquisition time. Two systems of linear equations that can be solved for the mean and variance, respectively, are developed. The matrices specifying the systems can be solved efficiently. As a particular example, the authors analyze the performance of systems with spread-spectrum signals having sequence lengths of 15 and 63 chips. It is shown that the two-dwell system can acquire timing and Doppler shifts in a reasonable time period. Although the system studied is not well-suited to multiple-access or antijam applications, the analysis techniques developed may prove useful in evaluating the performance of more complex acquisition techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"42","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4820808","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of timing and Doppler-shift in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of timing and Doppler-shift in a direct-sequence spread-spectrum system","sourcePdf":"00328956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025537S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","articleId":"328956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":328961,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

The main problem with frequency offset is that it introduces interference among the multiplicity of carriers in the OFDM signal. It is shown, and confirmed by simulation, that to maintain signal-to-interference ratios of 20 dB or greater for the OFDM carriers, offset is limited to 4% or less of the intercarrier spacing. Next, the paper describes a technique to estimate frequency offset using a repeated data symbol. A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is derived and its performance computed and compared with simulation results. Since the intercarrier interference energy and signal energy both contribute coherently to the estimate, the algorithm generates extremely accurate estimates even when the offset is far too great to demodulate the data values. Also, the estimation error depends only on total symbol energy so it is insensitive to channel spreading and frequency selective fading. A strategy is described for initial acquisition in the event of uncertainty in the initial offset that exceeds 1/2 the carrier spacing, the limit of the MLE algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328961/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","volume":"42","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4820812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing frequency offset correction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing frequency offset correction","sourcePdf":"00328961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023414S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1665","articleId":"328961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":328970,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The considered digital receiver operates on samples of the received signal, taken by a fixed clock which is not synchronized to the transmitter clock. Signal samples needed for detection of the information sequence are obtained from interpolation between the available samples. In the case of nonideal interpolation a BER degradation occurs. By means of theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that even simple interpolators, operating at only a few samples per symbol, yield BER degradations that are limited to a small fraction of a dB.

The average bit error rate (BER) of binary noncoherent frequency shift keying (NCFSK) on slow, nonselective Nakagami-fading channels is derived. Closed-form expressions that can be used to determine optimum switching thresholds (in a minimum error rate sense) are also derived. In addition, the use of optimum fixed thresholds is considered. It is found that a considerable amount of diversity gain can be obtained using an optimum fixed (rather than adaptive) switching threshold. Results are obtained for both independent and correlated Nakagami-fading branch signals. The effects of fading severity and the correlation coefficient on both the BER and on the optimum switching threshold are investigated. It is shown that useful diversity gain can be obtained with power correlation coefficients as high as 0.9 when the fading is strong. The results for a Rayleigh channel are obtained and presented as a special case of generalized-fading model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.328977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7779/00328977.pdf","startPage":"2959","endPage":"2966","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00328977.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.328977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of switched diversity systems on generalized-fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=328977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328977/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of switched diversity systems on generalized-fading channels","volume":"42","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4820821","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of switched diversity systems on generalized-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00328977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046245S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"137","articleId":"328977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":328978,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For slow fading the correlation between adjacent symbols is relatively high. The authors investigate the achievable error probabilities over the channel, employing coherent detection and ideal side information on the realization of the fading processes at the receiver. An underlying decoding delay constraint which precludes the use of (ideal) interleaving is assumed. Coded BPSK performance is addressed both with and without the piecewise constant approximation (according to which the fading value remains constant during the symbol duration). For the latter case, that is no piecewise constant approximation, the analysis relies on the Fredholm determinant associated with the fading process autocorrelation function. The authors focus on the exponentially correlated channel. The \"worst case\" pairs of codewords are identified. The exponential behavior of the error probability with random coding (and i.i.d. Gaussian inputs) is analyzed, and the behavior of the cut-off rate and capacity is addressed. The results enhance the insight to the effect of the basic parameters governing the performance and these are examined in view of previous works and compared to relevant performance results for the block-fading channel model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.328978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7779/00328978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.328978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"2967","endPage":"2978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Achievable performance over the correlated Rician channel","volume":"42","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4820822","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable performance over the correlated Rician channel","sourcePdf":"00328978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042653S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"52","articleId":"328978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":328982,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper describes a method for statistical testing based on a Markov chain model of software usage. The significance of the Markov chain is twofold. First, it allows test input sequences to be generated from multiple probability distributions, making it more general than many existing techniques. Analytical results associated with Markov chains facilitate informative analysis of the sequences before they are generated, indicating how the test is likely to unfold. Second, the test input sequences generated from the chain and applied to the software are themselves a stochastic model and are used to create a second Markov chain to encapsulate the history of the test, including any observed failure information. The influence of the failures is assessed through analytical computations on this chain. We also derive a stopping criterion for the testing process based on a comparison of the sequence generating properties of the two chains.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.328991","startPage":"812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/7780/00328991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.328991","endPage":"824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markov chain model for statistical software testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A Markov chain model for statistical software testing","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4797528","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markov chain model for statistical software testing","sourcePdf":"00328991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046544S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"261","articleId":"328991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":328993,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The object of this ongoing four-year study is to attempt to determine just how consistent the results of scientific computation really are, and, from this, to estimate accuracy. The experiment is being carried out in a branch of the earth sciences known as seismic data processing, where 15 or so independently developed large commercial packages that implement mathematical algorithms from the same or similar published specifications in the same programming language (Fortran) have been developed over the last 20 years. The results of processing the same input dataset, using the same user-specified parameters, for nine of these packages is reported in this paper. Finally, feedback of obvious flaws was attempted to reduce the overall disagreement. The results are deeply disturbing. Whereas scientists like to think that their code is accurate to the precision of the arithmetic used, in this study, numerical disagreement grows at around the rate of 1% in average absolute difference per 4000 fines of implemented code, and, even worse, the nature of the disagreement is nonrandom. Furthermore, the seismic data processing industry has better than average quality standards for its software development with both identifiable quality assurance functions and substantial test datasets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.328993","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"785","endPage":"797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/7780/00328993.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.328993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How accurate is scientific software?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data processing","Packaging","Geoscience","Computer languages","Feedback","Arithmetic","Computer industry","Software standards","Standards development","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programming","seismology","geophysics computing","software packages","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scientific software","N-version programming experiment","scientific computation","seismic data processing","large commercial packages","mathematical algorithms","programming language","Fortran","input dataset","seismic data processing industry","quality standards","software development","quality assurance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"How accurate is scientific software?","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4797526","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/328993/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How accurate is scientific software?","sourcePdf":"00328993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044199S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"76","articleId":"328993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":329003,"authors":[{"name":"E.

During the last 5-6 years active contour models have become popular for finding the contours of such objects. Connected to these models are iterative algorithms for finding the minimizing energy curves making the curves behave dynamically through the iterations. These approaches do however have several disadvantages. The numerical algorithms that are in use constrain the models that can be used. Furthermore, in many cases only local minima can be achieved. In this paper, the author discusses a method for curve detection based on a fully Bayesian approach. A model for image contours which allows the number of nodes on the contours to vary is introduced. Iterative algorithms based on stochastic sampling is constructed, which make it possible to simulate samples from the posterior distribution, making estimates and uncertainty measures of specific quantities available. Further, simulated annealing schemes making the curve move dynamically towards the global minimum energy configuration are presented. In theory, no restrictions on the models are made. In practice, however, computational aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing the models. Much more general models than the one used for active contours may however be applied. The approach is applied to ultrasound images of the left ventricle and to magnetic resonance images of the human brain, and show promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4802682","volume":"16","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian approach to dynamic contours through stochastic sampling and simulated annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian approach to dynamic contours through stochastic sampling and simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00329011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039348S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"116","articleId":"329011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":329262,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

This will increase the size of the circuit that can be implemented using the available FPGA structure. In this paper, we show that even restricted cases of the lookup-table minimization for FPGA technology mapping are NP-complete (even when K is a small constant), and that it can be solved optimally for all values of K on a tree input in O(min{nK, nlogn}) time where n is the number of nodes in the network and K is the input capacity of the LUT's. Based on our algorithm for trees, we present a polynomial time heuristic algorithm for general Boolean networks. Experimental results confirm substantial decrease on the number of LUT's on a number of MCNC logic synthesis benchmarks compared to the algorithms that allow no or just local exploitation of Boolean properties of the circuit. We obtain 10% to 80% improvement on the number of LUT's compared to the previous algorithms (even though we allow very limited operations, e.g., we do not exploit Boolean properties of the circuits or decompose nodes).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Minimization","Digital circuits","Polynomials","Heuristic algorithms","Boolean functions","Logic circuits","Circuit synthesis","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic arrays","computational complexity","minimisation","table lookup","trees (mathematics)","logic CAD","circuit CAD","directed graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lookup-table minimization problem","FPGA technology mapping","digital circuit","NP-complete","tree algorithm","polynomial time heuristic algorithm","Boolean networks","logic synthesis benchmarks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329262","doi":"10.1109/43.329262","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7786/00329262.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7786","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329262.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.329262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329262/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity of the lookup-table minimization problem for FPGA technology mapping","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","volume":"13","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4807284","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity of the lookup-table minimization problem for FPGA technology mapping","sourcePdf":"00329262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044054S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"49","articleId":"329262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":329264,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The MRST problem is known to be NP-hard, and the best performing MRST heuristic to date is the Iterated 1-Steiner (I1S) method recently proposed by Kahng and Robins (see ibid., vol. 11, p. 893-902, 1992). In this paper, we develop a straightforward, efficient implementation of I1S, achieving a speedup factor of three orders of magnitude over previous implementations. We also give a parallel implementation that achieves near-linear speedup on multiple processors. Several performance-improving enhancements enable us to obtain Steiner trees with average cost within 0.25% of optimal, and our methods produce optimal solutions in up to 90% of the cases for typical nets. We generalize I1S and its variants to three dimensions, as well as to the case where all the pins lie on k parallel planes, which arises in, e.g., multilayer routing. Motivated by the goal of reducing the running times of our algorithms, we prove that any pointset in the Manhattan plane has a minimum spanning tree (MST) with maximum degree 4, and that in three-dimensional Manhattan space every pointset has an MST with maximum degree of 14 (the best previous upper bounds on the maximum MST degree in two and three dimensions are 6 and 26, respectively); these results are of independent theoretical interest and also settle an open problem in complexity theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.329264","startPage":"1351","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329264.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/7786/00329264.pdf","endPage":"1365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.329264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329264/","displayDocTitle":"Closing the gap: near-optimal Steiner trees in polynomial time","volume":"13","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4807286","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closing the gap: near-optimal Steiner trees in polynomial time","sourcePdf":"00329264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060168S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"52","articleId":"329264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":329294,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Network size involves in the case of layered neural network architectures, the number of layers in a network, the number of nodes per layer, and the number of connections. Roughly speaking, a neural network implements a nonlinear mapping of u=G(x). The mapping function G is established during a training phase where the network learns to correctly associate input patterns x to output patterns u. Given a set of training examples (x, u), there is probably an infinite number of different size networks that can learn to map input patterns x into output patterns u. The question is, which network size is more appropriate for a given problem? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is not always obvious. Many researchers agree that the quality of a solution found by a neural network depends strongly on the network size used. In general, network size affects network complexity, and learning time. It also affects the generalization capabilities of the network; that is, its ability-to produce accurate results on patterns outside its training set.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/45.329294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","pdfPath":"/iel1/45/7787/00329294.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/45.329294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feed-forward neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329294","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Feed-forward neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329294/","publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4842472","volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feed-forward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00329294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104745S","chronDate":"Oct.-Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"45","citationCount":"137","articleId":"329294","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":329333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The caching strategy augments the basic location strategy proposed in existing standards such as GSM and IS-41, with the objective of reducing network signaling and database loads in exchange for increased CPU processing and memory costs. Since technology trends are driving the latter costs down, the auxiliary strategy will become increasingly attractive. The idea behind caching is to reuse the information about a called user's location for subsequent calls to that user, and is useful for those users who receive calls frequently relative to the rate at which they change registration areas. This idea attempts to exploit the spatial and temporal locality in calls received by users, similar to the idea of exploiting locality of file access in computer systems. We use a reference PCS architecture and the notion of a user's local call-to-mobility ratio (LCMR) to quantify the costs and benefits of using caching and classes of users for whom it would be beneficial. We also present two simple algorithms for estimating users' LCMR and the situation in which each is preferable. We show that under a variety of assumptions caching is likely to yield significant net benefits in terms of reduced signaling network traffic and database loads.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A caching strategy to reduce network impacts of PCS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A caching strategy to reduce network impacts of PCS","sourcePdf":"00329333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051082S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"197","articleId":"329333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":329334,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The proposed protocol guarantees that each link will be successfully activated at least once in a frame without the need to adjust transmission schedules in mobile environments. Compared to other protocols with guaranteed delivery, the overhead due to the recomputation of transmission schedules is eliminated and, accordingly, transmissions need not be suspended for schedule reorganization. Furthermore, contrary to previously known protocols that adapt to mobility by schedule recomputation, the proposed solution is not subject to a potential catastrophic failure when the rate of topology changes exceeds the rate at which schedules can be readjusted.

An ATM compatible wireless network concept capable of supporting a mix of broadband ISDN services including constant bit-rate (CBR), variable bit-rate (VBR), and packet data transport is explored from an architectural viewpoint. The proposed system uses a hierarchical ATM switching network for interconnection of PCN microcells, each of which is serviced by high-speed, shared-access radio links based on ATM-compatible cell, relay principles. Design issues related to the physical (modulation), media access control (MAC), and data-link layers of the ATM-based radio link are discussed, and preliminary technical approaches are identified in each case.

Central to this approach is a new concept known as the virtual connection tree which avoids the need to involve the network call processor for every cell handoff attempt. Such an approach can readily support a very high rate of handoffs, thereby enabling use of physically small radio cells to provide very high system capacity, but may occasionally cause the volume of traffic to be handled by one cell site to exceed that cell site's capacity. A simple analytical methodology is developed which can be used for admission control, the purpose of which is to limit the number of in-progress calls such that two new quality of service metrics (overload probability and average time in overload) can be kept suitably low. Finally, a general framework is presented for overall system organization and signaling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An architecture and methodology for mobile-executed handoff in cellular ATM networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.329339","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7789/00329339.pdf","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.329339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An architecture and methodology for mobile-executed handoff in cellular ATM networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture and methodology for mobile-executed handoff in cellular ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00329339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034347S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"326","articleId":"329339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":329340,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The setting is a highway with multiple entrances and exits. Vehicles are classified as calling or noncalling, depending upon whether or not they have calls in progress. The main interest is in the calling vehicles; but noncalling vehicles are important because they can become calling vehicles if they initiate (place or receive) a call. The deterministic model ignores the behavior of individual vehicles and treats them as a continuous fluid, whereas the stochastic traffic models consider the random behavior of each vehicle. However, all three models use the same two coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the evolution of the system. The call density and call handoff rate (or their expected values in the stochastic models) are readily computable by solving these equations. Since no capacity constraints are imposed in the models, these computed quantities can be regarded as offered traffic loads. The models complement each other, because the fluid model can be extended to include additional features such as capacity constraints and the interdependence between velocity and vehicular density, while the stochastic traffic model can provide probability distributions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate how the models can be used to investigate various aspects of time and space dynamics in wireless networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.329340","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329340.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7789/00329340.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.329340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic models for wireless communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Traffic models for wireless communication networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329340/","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4797000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic models for wireless communication networks","sourcePdf":"00329340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027461S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"85","articleId":"329340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":329345,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The capture probabilities and their asymptotic value, as the number of colliding packets tends to infinity, are computed. A sufficient condition, under which this limit is positive, is identified and expressed in terms of the spatial distribution of the users. Also, various models for this latter distribution are discussed. These results help identify the region in which the system may achieve a positive stable throughput. Finally, a retransmission control scheme, that enhances the throughput, is considered, and the stability of the system is rigorously proven. We also show that the use of retransmission control is unavoidable if the network performance predicted in some recent literature is to be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7789/00329345.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.329345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.329345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capture and retransmission control in mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio control","Land mobile radio","Throughput","Communication system control","Protocols","Mobile communication","Rayleigh channels","Shadow mapping","H infinity control","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","telecommunications control","probability","fading","radiowave propagation","statistical analysis","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","retransmission control","slotted ALOHA protocol","Rayleigh fading","log-normal shadowing","capture probabilities","sufficient condition","spatial distribution","throughput","system stability","network performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Capture and retransmission control in mobile radio","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4796995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capture and retransmission control in mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00329345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093413S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"209","articleId":"329345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":329346,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The model accommodates two different loading scenarios-one in which the heat load is distributed evenly across the cable tray cross-section and a second one which concentrates the heavily loaded cables along the center-line and surrounds them with more lightly loaded cables. The second model is designed to yield a maximum cable temperature and to account for the load diversity that exists in a realistically operated tray. Temperature predictions provided by the model are compared with previous laboratory cable tray experiments and with data collected during a four year study in which cable temperatures were measured in an operating nuclear plant. Reasons for differences between the field data and the computer results are discussed. The model is used to evaluate the conservatism in the ICEA P54-440 as a result of load diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.329503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.329503","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1740","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7794/00329503.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ampacity of cables in single open-top cable trays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Ampacity of cables in single open-top cable trays","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4826965","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329503/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ampacity of cables in single open-top cable trays","sourcePdf":"00329503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039007S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"10","articleId":"329503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":329514,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

For a HIF detection, the proposed technique is based on a number of characteristics of the HIF current. These characteristics are: fault current magnitude; magnitude of the 3rd harmonic current; magnitude of the 5th harmonic current; the angle of the third harmonic current; the angle difference between the third harmonics current and the fundamental voltage; and the negative sequence current of HIF. These characteristics are identified by modeling the distribution feeders in EMTP. Apart from these characteristics, the above ambient (average) negative sequence current is also considered. An adjustable block out region around the average load current is provided. The average load current is calculated at every 18000 cycles (5 minutes) interval. This adaptive feature will not only make the proposed scheme more sensitive to low fault current, but it will also prevent the relay from tripping during the normal load current. In this paper, the logic circuit required for implementing the proposed HIF detection method is also included. With minimal modifications, the logic developed for the HIF detection can be applied to low impedance fault detection. A complete logic circuit which detects both the HIF and LIF is proposed. Using this combined logic, the need of installing separate devices for HIF and LIF detection can be eliminated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.329514","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7794/00329514.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.329514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive high and low impedance fault detection method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Fault detection","Circuit faults","Fault currents","Logic circuits","Logic devices","Electrical fault detection","Voltage","EMTP","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","fault location","power system harmonics","fault currents","distribution networks","distribution networks","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection method","high impedance fault","low impedance fault","fault current magnitude","3rd harmonic current","5th harmonic current","current angle","fundamental voltage","negative sequence current","distribution feeders","EMTP","adjustable block out region","average load current","logic circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive high and low impedance fault detection method","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4826973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive high and low impedance fault detection method","sourcePdf":"00329514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031333S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"76","articleId":"329514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":329515,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

One consists of a periodic, sinusoidal law, the other of a band-limited white-noise law. The arc-furnace model is implemented by EMTP, referring to actual electric-plant configurations. Simulations are reported where the values of flicker sensation and short-term flicker severity P/sub ST/, are determined according to UIE specifications. The results show that the model based on the sinusoidal time-variation law can be useful for worst-case approximations, while the model using white-noise law is able to fit flicker measurements made in electric plants supplying arc furnaces. The models are used to investigate the effect on flicker compensation of the insertion of series inductors at the supply side of the furnace transformer. It is shown that considerable reduction of P/sub ST/ is obtained at the point of common coupling by series inductor installation at constant furnace active power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.329535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7794/00329535.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.329535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7794","startPage":"2026","endPage":"2036","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329535.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc-furnace model for the study of flicker compensation in electrical networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Arc-furnace model for the study of flicker compensation in electrical networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4826995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc-furnace model for the study of flicker compensation in electrical networks","sourcePdf":"00329535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0598S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"148","articleId":"329535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":329537,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The study is based on investigation of the eigenvalues of a simple linearized power system model. The controllable series components are located on the transmission line connecting two areas and the controllable shunt capacitor is located close to a load. It is shown that the level of transmission line loading, load characteristics and inertia of the two areas influence the damping achieved by the controllable components to different degrees. The contributions of the controllable series components to the enhancement of power system damping for the same rating of the controllable components are compared. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical findings. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight and understandings in the basic characteristics of the damping effects of the studied devices. This insight is obtained by study of a simple power system that exhibits power oscillations. The understandings and findings can facilitate the analysis of realistic, and more complex power systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.329537","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329537.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.329537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7794","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7794/00329537.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power systems","Control systems","Power system modeling","Capacitors","Power transmission lines","Transmission line theory","Power system analysis computing","Phase shifters","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","phase shifters","power capacitors","power system interconnection","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","load (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system oscillations damping","controllable components","power system electromechanical oscillations","controllable series compensators","series capacitors","phase shifters","controllable shunt capacitors","linearized power system model","transmission lines interconnection","transmission line loading","load characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Damping of power system oscillations by use of controllable components","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329537/","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4826997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of power system oscillations by use of controllable components","sourcePdf":"00329537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031081S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"114","articleId":"329537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":329539,"authors":[{"name":"N.D.R.

The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with calculations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.329645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.329645","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7799/00329645.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7799","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329645.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupling coefficient modulation of waveguide grating using sampled grating","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Coupling coefficient modulation of waveguide grating using sampled grating","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"6","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4809352","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329645/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupling coefficient modulation of waveguide grating using sampled grating","sourcePdf":"00329645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027438S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"34","articleId":"329645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":329647,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The nonlinear Schrodinger equation predicts that two co-propagating, in-phase spatial solitons remain bound to each other, executing a periodic separation. This disagrees with our new extensively tested finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) solution of Maxwell's equations. FD-TD shows that co-propagating in-phase spatial solitons become unbound, i.e. diverge to arbitrarily large separations, if the ratio of soliton beamwidth to wavelength is order 1 or less. Not relying upon paraxial approximations or analogies to temporal soliton interactions, FD-TD appears to be a robust means of obtaining detailed models of the interaction of sub-picosecond pulsed light beams in nonlinear media directly in the space-time domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial soliton deflection mechanism indicated by FD-TD Maxwell's equations modeling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.329654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/7799/00329654.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.329654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329654/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Spatial soliton deflection mechanism indicated by FD-TD Maxwell's equations modeling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4809361","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial soliton deflection mechanism indicated by FD-TD Maxwell's equations modeling","sourcePdf":"00329654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091975S","chronDate":"Oct.  1994","isNumber":"7799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"37","articleId":"329654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":329657,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the major drawback of the hypercube is the increase in the number of communication channels for each processor with an increase in the total number of processors in the system. This drawback has a direct effect on the very large scale integration complexity of the hypercube network. This short note proposes a new topology that is produced from the hypercube by a uniform reduction in the number of edges for each node. This edge reduction technique produces networks with lower complexity than hypercubes while maintaining, to a high extent, the powerful hypercube properties. An extensive comparison of the proposed reduced hypercube (RH) topology with the conventional hypercube is included. It is also shown that several copies of the popular cube-connected cycles network can be emulated simultaneously by an RH with dilation 1.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.329667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7800/00329667.pdf","startPage":"1210","endPage":"1220","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329667.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.329667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RH: a versatile family of reduced hypercube interconnection networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=329667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329667/","displayDocTitle":"RH: a versatile family of reduced hypercube interconnection networks","volume":"5","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4798625","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RH: a versatile family of reduced hypercube interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"00329667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046725S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"50","articleId":"329667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":329671,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.A.

In the proposed test architecture, concurrent testing (or online monitoring) at the system level is accomplished by enforcing the run-time testing of the data and control dependences of the algorithm currently being executed on the parallel computer. In order to help in this process, each message contains both source and destination addresses. At each message source, the sequence of destination addresses of the outgoing messages is compressed on a block basis. At the same time, at each destination, the sequence of source addresses of all incoming messages is compressed, also on a block basis. Concurrent compression of the instructions executed by the PEs is also possible. As a result of this procedure, an image of the data dependences and of the control flow of the currently running algorithm is created. This image is compared, at the end of each computational block, with a reference image created at compilation time. The main results of this work are in proposing new principles for the online system-level testing of multiprocessor systems, based on signaturing and monitoring the data dependences together with the control dependences, and in providing an analytical model and analysis for the address compression process used for monitoring the data routing process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1994","volume":"5","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4798621","displayDocTitle":"A concurrent test architecture for massively parallel computers and its error detection capability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A concurrent test architecture for massively parallel computers and its error detection capability","sourcePdf":"00329671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069805S","chronDate":"Nov 1994","isNumber":"7800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"329671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":329683,"authors":[{"name":"N.

System parameters are estimated by Hopfield type neural network, while the system is in certain operating mode. When the system dynamics changes, estimated parameters go through a transition period and this period is used to detect faults. These estimates, however, are not reliable enough to be used for isolating faults. The judgment on the instance at which the estimates move out of the transition zone is made through a set of statistical tests performed on the residuals in a moving window. Once the system is out of the transition zone and settles to a new operating level, the estimated parameters are classified using an ART-1 based neural network. The proposed scheme is implemented to detect and isolate faults in a position servo system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.329685","startPage":"890","endPage":"899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.329685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7801/00329685.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hopfield/ART-1 neural network-based fault detection and isolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329685/","displayDocTitle":"Hopfield/ART-1 neural network-based fault detection and isolation","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4821970","pubMedId":"18267863","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hopfield/ART-1 neural network-based fault detection and isolation","sourcePdf":"00329685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070894S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"43","articleId":"329685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":329686,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

This neural network is devised by introducing a space tessellation which is a covering of the Euclidean space by nonoverlapping hyperpolyhedral convex cells. In the proposed neural network, a number of neural network granules (NNG's) are processed in parallel and repeated regularly with the same structures. Each NNG does a local mapping with an interpolation capability for a corresponding hyperpolyhedral convex cell in a tessellation. The plastic weights of the NNG can be calculated to implement the mapping for training data; consequently, this reduces training time and alleviates the difficulties of local minima in training. In addition, the interpolation capability of the NNG improves the generalization for the new data within the convex cell. The proposed network requires additional neurons for tessellation over the standard multilayer neural networks. This increases the network size but does not slow the retrieval response when implemented by parallel architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.329691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"936","endPage":"944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7801/00329691.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329691.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.329691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructive neural networks with piecewise interpolation capabilities for function approximations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Interpolation","Function approximation","Piecewise linear approximation","Multi-layer neural network","Piecewise linear techniques","Training data","Neurons","Parallel architectures","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","interpolation","learning (artificial intelligence)","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","function approximation","piecewise-linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constructive neural networks","piecewise interpolation","function approximations","arbitrary continuous functions","space tessellation","Euclidean space","nonoverlapping hyperpolyhedral convex cells","neural network granules","local mapping","hyperpolyhedral convex cell","plastic weights","training data","retrieval response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Constructive neural networks with piecewise interpolation capabilities for function approximations","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4821975","pubMedId":"18267868","publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329691/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructive neural networks with piecewise interpolation capabilities for function approximations","sourcePdf":"00329691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040969S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"31","articleId":"329691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":329693,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Jin","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Laboratory, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"lastName":"Liang Jin","id":"37087337528"},{"name":"P.N.

This work benchmarks the first reported HBT noise results of an HBT amplifier using common-base active input matching. The 2-stage amplifier consists of a common-base input stage that is directly coupled to a Darlington feedback amplifier output stage. The common-base input can he bias tuned to achieve >13-dB return loss at 3 GHz and a minimum noise figure of 2.9 dB at 1 GHz. A gain of 17.5 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth greater than 5 GHz was achieved under low-noise input bias. This amplifier topology can be implemented without the use of a complex microwave process, which typically integrates backside vias and microstrip matching components. The compact amplifier consumes an area of 0.82/spl times/0.47 mm/sup 2/, which is 10 times smaller than a previously reported 2.5-4 GHz narrow-band passive matched HBT amplifier with similar noise and gain performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.329710","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00329710.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/7802/00329710.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"375","doi":"10.1109/75.329710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-noise baseband 5-GHz direct-coupled HBT amplifier with common-base active input match","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A low-noise baseband 5-GHz direct-coupled HBT amplifier with common-base active input match","volume":"4","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"4816252","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329710/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-noise baseband 5-GHz direct-coupled HBT amplifier with common-base active input match","sourcePdf":"00329710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028993S","chronDate":"Nov.  1994","isNumber":"7802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"15","articleId":"329710","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":329723,"authors":[{"name":"H.

I, see ibid., vol. 41, no. 10, p. 641-55 (1994). In Part I of the research work, we introduced an extension to the well known Chinese remainder theorem for processing polynomials with coefficients defined over a finite integer ring. We term this extension as the American-Indian-Chinese extension of the Chinese remainder theorem. A systematic procedure for factorizing a monic polynomial into pairwise relatively prime monic factor polynomials over integer rings was presented. This factorization is based on the corresponding factor polynomials, monic and relatively prime, over the associated finite field containing prime number of elements. In this paper, we study the application of the theory developed in Part I to deriving computationally efficient algorithms for performing tasks having multilinear form. Especially, we focus on the cyclic and acyclic convolution as they are two of the most frequently occurring computationally intensive tasks in digital signal processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/329736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1994","volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4822211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rings, fields, the Chinese remainder theorem and an extension-Part II: applications to digital signal processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rings, fields, the Chinese remainder theorem and an extension-Part II: applications to digital signal processing","sourcePdf":"00329736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064818S","chronDate":"Oct 1994","isNumber":"7804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"12","articleId":"329736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":329741,"authors":[{"name":"D.
