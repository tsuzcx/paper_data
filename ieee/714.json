Unlike earlier multi-resolution methods, in which putative matches at low-resolutions can lead the matcher to an incorrect solution, our method generates exactly the same answer as a brute-force full-resolution method. We provide a proof of this. Novelly, our method allows decimation of both the look-up table and in the point cloud, yielding a 10x speedup versus contemporary correlative methods. When a robot closes a large-scale loop, it must often consider many loop-closure candidates. In this paper, we describe an approach for posing a scan matching query over these candidates jointly, finding the best match(es) between a particular pose and a set of candidate poses (\u201cone-to-many\u201d), or the best match between two sets of poses (\u201cmany-to-many\u201d). This mode of operation finds the first loop closure as much as 45x faster than traditional \u201cone-to-one\u201d scan matching.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140013/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"M3RSM: Many-to-many multi-resolution scan matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M3RSM: Many-to-many multi-resolution scan matching","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060385S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7140014,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

The performance of any such approach depends crucially upon initializing the optimization algorithm near a good solution for the inference problem, a condition that is often difficult or impossible to guarantee in practice. To address this limitation, in this paper we present a formulation of the SLAM M-estimation with the property that, by expanding the feasible set of the estimation program, we obtain a convex relaxation whose solution approximates the globally optimal solution of the SLAM inference problem and can be recovered using a smooth optimization method initialized at any feasible point. Our formulation thus provides a means to obtain a high-quality solution to the SLAM problem without requiring high-quality initialization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International

in numerical benchmark functions and are thus promising tools for the high-dimensional optimization of controllers for multiple robots with limited sensing capabilities, which have inherently noisy performance evaluations. In this article, we apply a statistical technique called Optimal Computing Budget Allocation to improve the performance of Particle Swarm Optimization in the presence of noise for a multi-robot obstacle avoidance benchmark task. We present a new distributed PSO OCBA algorithm suitable for resource-constrained mobile robots due to its low requirements in terms of memory and limited local communication. Our results from simulation show that PSO OCBA outperforms other techniques for dealing with noise, achieving a more consistent progress and a better estimate of the ground-truth performance of candidate solutions. We then validate our simulations with real robot experiments where we compare the controller learned with our proposed algorithm to a potential field controller for obstacle avoidance in a cluttered environment. We show that they both achieve a high performance through different avoidance behaviors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140036/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15278301","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140036/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A distributed noise-resistant Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for high-dimensional multi-robot learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed noise-resistant Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for high-dimensional multi-robot learning","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062208S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7140060,"authors":[{"name":"Moises Pacheco","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Playware, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Moises","lastName":"Pacheco","id":"37077409500"},{"name":"Rune Fogh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Playware, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rune","lastName":"Fogh","id":"37085497915"},{"name":"Henrik Hautop Lund","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Playware, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Henrik Hautop","lastName":"Lund","id":"37272835200"},{"name":"David Johan Christensen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Playware, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"David Johan","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37543509000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7140060","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Connectors","Programming profession","Assembly","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","programming languages","robot programming","teaching","visual programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["creative learning","building robots","programming robots","Fable modular robotic system","self-contained modules","sensors","actuators","visual programming language","user groups","teaching context"]}],"abstract":"Robotic systems have a high potential for creative learning if they are flexible, accessible and engaging for the user in the experimental process of building and programming robots.

Efficient work coordination requires both awareness of the human pose and a plan of action for both human and robot agents in order to compute robot motion trajectories that synchronize naturally with human motion. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that synthesizes anticipatory knowledge of both human motions and subsequent action steps in order to predict in real-time the intended target of a human performing a reaching motion. Motion-level anticipatory models are constructed using multiple demonstrations of human reaching motions. We produce a library of motions from human demonstrations, based on a statistical representation of the degrees of freedom of the human arm, using time series analysis, wherein each time step is encoded as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach through offline statistical analysis of human motion data. The results indicate a considerable improvement over prior techniques in early prediction, achieving 70% or higher correct classification on average for the first third of the trajectory (<; 500msec). We also indicate proof-of-concept through the demonstration of a human-robot cooperative manipulation task performed with a PR2 robot. Finally, we analyze the quality of task-level anticipatory knowledge required to improve prediction performance early in the human motion trajectory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast target prediction of human reaching motion for cooperative human-robot manipulation tasks using time series classification","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140066","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07140066.pdf","startPage":"6175","endPage":"6182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast target prediction of human reaching motion for cooperative human-robot manipulation tasks using time series classification","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140066/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278404","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast target prediction of human reaching motion for cooperative human-robot manipulation tasks using time series classification","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070786S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7140074,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenz Meier","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Geometry Group, Institute for Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lorenz","lastName":"Meier","id":"37970944100"},{"name":"Dominik Honegger","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Geometry Group, Institute for Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Honegger","id":"38540989300"},{"name":"Marc Pollefeys","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Geometry Group, Institute for Visual Computing, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Pollefeys","id":"37085340486"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7140074","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":204,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2602},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linux","Hardware","Computer architecture","Vehicles","Software","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","embedded systems","Linux","middleware","open systems","public domain software","robot programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PX4","node-based multithreaded open source robotics framework","deeply embedded platforms","deeply embedded robotics middleware","programming environment","multithreaded design pattern","publish-subscribe design pattern","Unix-like software interface","microcontroller","deeply embedded open source systems","standards-oriented platform","publish-subscribe object request broker","POSIX application programming interface","vertical takeoff and landing","VTOL","ROS nodes","Linux","interoperability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140074","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07140074.pdf","startPage":"6235","endPage":"6240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PX4: A node-based multithreaded open source robotics framework for deeply embedded platforms","abstract":"We present a novel, deeply embedded robotics middleware and programming environment.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is used to detect aircraft. The UAV needs to fly through pre-assigned waypoints while avoiding collisions with other aircraft. The aircraft are indifferent to the UAV. A collision with aircraft are detected by simulating the UAV's trajectory along the path of assigned waypoints using its closed-loop dynamics. A sampling based algorithm is used for collision avoidance path planning. A second collision check is performed on the generated path with the updated UAV and aircraft's states. The path will be re-planned if it leads to a collision. The algorithm was validated in Software-In-the-Loop Simulation (SITL). ADS-B data obtained from commercial aircraft flying over the Phoenix Skyharbor airport were used for simulating the collisions. The paper shows that the algorithm enables the UAV to avoid multiple aircraft with different approaching angles and speeds.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140098","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07140098.pdf","startPage":"6402","endPage":"6407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sense and avoid for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using ADS-B","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140098/","displayDocTitle":"Sense and avoid for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using ADS-B","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286293","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140098/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sense and avoid for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using ADS-B","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081291S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140101,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Bircher","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Bircher","id":"37085485405"},{"name":"Kostas Alexis","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Alexis","id":"37546514600"},{"name":"Michael Burri","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Burri","id":"38566149900"},{"name":"Philipp Oettershagen","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Oettershagen","id":"37085501292"},{"name":"Sammy Omari","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sammy","lastName":"Omari","id":"37077953100"},{"name":"Thomas Mantel","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mantel","id":"37085483247"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, ZH, CH"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7140101","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1963},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Three-dimensional displays","Robot sensing systems","Cameras","Planning","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","condition monitoring","helicopters","inspection","mobile robots","path planning","structural engineering","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural inspection path planning","iterative viewpoint resampling","aerial robotics","complex 3D structures","triangular mesh representation","rotorcraft","fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems","alternating two-step optimization"]}],"abstract":"Within this paper, a new fast algorithm that provides efficient solutions to the problem of inspection path planning for complex 3D structures is presented. The algorithm assumes a triangular mesh representation of the structure and employs an alternating two-step optimization paradigm to find good viewpoints that together provide full coverage and a connecting path that has low cost. In every iteration, the viewpoints are chosen such that the connection cost is reduced and, subsequently, the tour is optimized. Vehicle and sensor limitations are respected within both steps. Sample implementations are provided for rotorcraft and fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems. The resulting algorithm characteristics are evaluated using simulation studies as well as multiple real-world experimental test-cases with both vehicle types.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140101","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07140101.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140101","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"6423","endPage":"6430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural inspection path planning via iterative viewpoint resampling with application to aerial robotics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Structural inspection path planning via iterative viewpoint resampling with application to aerial robotics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140101/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286156","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural inspection path planning via iterative viewpoint resampling with application to aerial robotics","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"2487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07289S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":7140110,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schr\u00f6er","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Schr\u00f6er","id":"38467543800"},{"name":"Ingo Killmann","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Killmann","id":"37085365404"},{"name":"Barbara Frank","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Frank","id":"37583383600"},{"name":"Martin V\u00f6lker","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"V\u00f6lker","id":"37085365519"},{"name":"Lukas Fiederer","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Fiederer","id":"37085354613"},{"name":"Tonio Ball","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tonio","lastName":"Ball","id":"37085348968"},{"name":"Wolfram Burgard","affiliation":["University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Burgard","id":"37270485300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6923-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6921-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"7140110","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mouth","Electroencephalography","Robot kinematics","Face","Liquids","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","diseases","medical robotics","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous robotic assistant","drinking","stroke","neurodegenerative diseases","neurologic disorders","chronic paralysis","robotic assistants","brain-machine interfaces","liquid intake","autonomous online detection","shared-control setting","frequency-specific modulations","electroencephalography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140110","abstract":"Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, among a range of other neurologic disorders, can cause chronic paralysis. Patients suffering from paralysis may remain unable to achieve even basic everyday tasks such as liquid intake. Currently, there is a great interest in developing robotic assistants controlled via brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to restore the ability to perform such tasks. This paper describes an autonomous robotic assistant for liquid intake. The components of the system include autonomous online detection both of the cup to be grasped and of the mouth of the user. It plans motions of the robot arm under the constraints that the cup stays upright while moving towards the mouth and that the cup stays in direct contact with the user's mouth while the robot tilts it during the drinking phase. To achieve this, our system also includes a technique for online estimation of the location of the user's mouth even under partial occlusions by the cup or robot arm. We tested our system in a real environment and in a shared-control setting using frequency-specific modulations recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) from the brain of the user. Our experiments demonstrate that our BMI-controlled robotic system enables a reliable liquid intake. We believe that our approach can easily be extended to other useful tasks including food intake and object manipulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140110","startPage":"6482","endPage":"6487","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128761/7138973/07140110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7138973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An autonomous robotic assistant for drinking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An autonomous robotic assistant for drinking","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140110/","accessionNumber":"15278324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140110/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autonomous robotic assistant for drinking","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"1885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071439S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128761","isNumber":"7138973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128761","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7138973","articleId":"7140110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7140129,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Fan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Sheng-Fan Yang","id":"37085428548"},{"name":"Tzuen-Hsi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Tzuen-Hsi Huang","id":"37401324200"},{"name":"Chun-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chun-Cheng Chen","id":"37085431000"},{"name":"Chun-Yi Lu","affiliation":["Delta Research Center, Delta Electronics Inc., Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chun-Yi Lu","id":"37085438225"},{"name":"Pei-Jung Chung","affiliation":["Delta Research Center, Delta Electronics Inc., Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Pei-Jung Chung","id":"37085428005"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7447-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7140129","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":673},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Patch antennas","Array signal processing","Microwave antenna arrays","Phase shifters","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","energy harvesting","microstrip antenna arrays","phase control","UHF antennas","UHF phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming power emitter design","phase control","Microwave-RF-based energy harvesting","EH receiver","patch antenna array","reflection-type phase shifter","energy transmission efficiency","frequency 915 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless power transfer (WPT)","beamforming","antenna array","energy harvesting"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming power emitter design with 2\u00d72 antenna array and phase control for microwave/RF-based energy harvesting","doi":"10.1109/WPT.2015.7140129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7139127","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Wireless Power Transfer Conference (WPTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131285/7139127/07140129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPT.2015.7140129","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140129","abstract":"In this paper, a 915-MHz RF-power emitter with an antenna array controlled by phase shifters is proposed to make directional energy beam point to the energy harvesting (EH) receiver.

In this paper, we propose a method to optimize power allocation strategy in an amplify-and-forward relay system. Our objective is to attain a max-min fairness within co-channel users. To reduce the complexity we maximize the upper bound on the performance. The reason is that this bound is observed to be tight in low noise conditions. Therefore, one achievement of this work is separating the problem of relay pre-coding design from power allocation. Then, the power control is done iteratively via the proposed low-complexity algorithm whose convergence is proven. The relay precoder can be subsequently designed via existing methods, such as semidefinite programming, nonetheless, it is beyond the main focus of the current work. The optimality of the proposed power allocation algorithm is very hard to mathematically prove.

Split manufacturing has emerged as a viable approach to protect integrated circuits (ICs) fabricated in untrusted foundries, but has high cost and/or high performance overhead. Furthermore, split manufacturing cannot fully prevent untargeted hardware Trojan insertions. In this paper, we propose to insert additional functional circuitry called obfuscated built-in self-authentication (OBISA) in the chip layout with split manufacturing process, in order to prevent reverse-engineering and further prevent hardware Trojan insertion. Self-tests are performed to authenticate the trustworthiness of the OBISA circuitry. The OBISA circuit is connected to original design in order to increase the strength of obfuscation, thereby allowing a higher layer split and lower overall cost. Additional fan-outs are created in OBISA circuitry to improve obfuscation without losing testability. Our proposed gating mechanism and net selection method can ensure negligible overhead in terms of area, timing, and dynamic power. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in several benchmark circuits.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2015.7140229","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7119893/7140225/07140229.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2015.7140229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and secure split manufacturing via obfuscated built-in self-authentication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and secure split manufacturing via obfuscated built-in self-authentication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140229/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277775","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and secure split manufacturing via obfuscated built-in self-authentication","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP003082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051969S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7119893","isNumber":"7140225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7119893","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7140225","articleId":"7140229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":7140231,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Pai-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085344760"},{"name":"Runchen Fang","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Runchen","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085499496"},{"name":"Rui Liu","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085479406"},{"name":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Chaitali","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37085497803"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085461285"},{"name":"Shimeng Yu","affiliation":["Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shimeng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085352683"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7421-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7140231","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1040},"abstract":"This work presents the optimized design of a physical unclonable function (PUF) primitive based on the cross-point resistive random access memory (RRAM) array. The randomness of the PUF comes from the resistance variation of RRAM cells in the array. A four-cell selection scheme is proposed to create a large number of challenge-response pairs necessary for achieving a high security level. To analyze the performance of the PUF with respect to uniqueness and reliability, the RRAM cross-point array is fabricated and the device parameters are calibrated from the experimental data. Our study shows that the RRAM PUF can function properly across a wide temperature range without degradation in the performance. However, IR drop due to the interconnect resistance in the array can potentially hamper the performance. To mitigate the effect of IR drop, a reverse scaling rule on the feature size (F) is proposed for RRAM PUF. While this increases the area of the RRAM PUF, it improves the PUF performance significantly. Compared to a conventional SRAM PUF in 45nm node, a RRAM PUF array size of 1024\u00d71024 with relaxed F=200nm has -45% lower area, while offering better robustness against invasive and side-channel attacks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Hardware","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","logic design","resistive RAM","security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side-channel attacks","invasive attacks","reverse scaling rule","temperature range","challenge-response pairs","security level","four-cell selection scheme","resistance variation","RRAM cross-point array","cross-point resistive random access memory array","RRAM PUF","physical unclonable function primitive","compact design","resistive cross-point array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical unclonable function","PUF","resistive memory","RRAM","ReRAM","reliability","uniqueness","area cost","hardware security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140231","doi":"10.1109/HST.2015.7140231","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7119893/7140225/07140231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2015.7140231","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140225","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting resistive cross-point array for compact design of physical unclonable function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting resistive cross-point array for compact design of physical unclonable function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140231/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140231/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277759","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting resistive cross-point array for compact design of physical unclonable function","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP005021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128473S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7119893","isNumber":"7140225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7119893","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7140225","articleId":"7140231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7140235,"authors":[{"name":"Gedare Bloom","affiliation":["George Washington University, Washington, DC"],"firstName":"Gedare","lastName":"Bloom","id":"37589164400"},{"name":"Bhagirath Narahari","affiliation":["George Washington University, Washington, DC"],"firstName":"Bhagirath","lastName":"Narahari","id":"37352246900"},{"name":"Rahul Simha","affiliation":["George Washington University, Washington, DC"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Simha","id":"37352248800"},{"name":"Ali Namazi","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation, Inc, Rockville, MD"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Namazi","id":"37293877700"},{"name":"Renato Levy","affiliation":["Intelligent Automation, Inc, Rockville, MD"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Levy","id":"37530422000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7421-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7140235","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":607},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA SoC architecture and runtime to prevent hardware Trojans from leaking secrets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140235","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-chip","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Trojan horses","IP networks","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA SoC architecture","hardware trojans","secret leaking","root-of-trust","secure systems","system-on-chip","trusted software","on-chip resource morphing","fabrication-time trojans","arbitrated voting","design-time Trojans","partial runtime reconfiguration","PRR","hardware abstraction layer","HAL","morph onion-encryption replication PRR HAL","MORPH","embedded systems developers"]}],"abstract":"Hardware Trojans compromise security by invalidating the assumption that hardware provides a root-of-trust for secure systems.

To our knowledge, no systematic approach has been proposed for this purpose. This paper introduces Timing Violation Vulnerability Factor (TVVF), which evaluates the vulnerability of a hardware structure to setup time violation attacks. TVVF, a probablistic metric computed on a circuit's netlist, is comprised of two factors: First, the probability of injecting a specific fault in the hardware structure, and second, the probability of propagating this fault to the output of the structure. TVVF aims at evaluating the security of designs against intentional faults caused by an adversary. In contrast, existing vulnerability metrics such as the Architecture Vulnerability Factor (AVF), evaluate the system reliability against random uncontrolled faults. To show the applicability of our metric, we compute the TVVF for two fault attacks on two AES netlists, which are generated for an FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2015.7140240","startPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7119893/7140225/07140240.pdf","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2015.7140240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140240/","displayDocTitle":"TVVF: Estimating the vulnerability of hardware cryptosystems against timing violation attacks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140240/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15277754","publicationDate":"May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TVVF: Estimating the vulnerability of hardware cryptosystems against timing violation attacks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP014072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077693S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7119893","isNumber":"7140225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7119893","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7140225","articleId":"7140240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7140247,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Gilmore","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Technologies, ECIT, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Gilmore","id":"37085387729"},{"name":"Neil Hanley","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Technologies, ECIT, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Hanley","id":"37590805600"},{"name":"Maire O'Neill","affiliation":["Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Belfast, GB"],"firstName":"Maire","lastName":"O'Neill"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7421-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7140247","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Error analysis","Cryptography","Principal component analysis","Hardware","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","neural nets","pattern classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based attack","masked implementation","AES","cryptographic algorithms","embedded cryptographic devices","side channel attacks","mask value identification","secret key value identification","principal component analysis","PCA","differential power analysis contest data set","DPA","machine learning","Advanced Encryption Standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCA","neural network","AES","machine learning","masking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HST.2015.7140247","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7119893/7140225/07140247.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2015.7140247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based attack on a masked implementation of AES","abstract":"Masked implementations of cryptographic algorithms are often used in commercial embedded cryptographic devices to increase their resistance to side channel attacks.

In this work we present and evaluate a novel hardware implementation of the lightweight cipher PRESENT with built-in side-channel countermeasures based on dynamic logic reconfiguration. In our design we make use of Configurable Look-Up Tables (CFGLUT) integrated in modern Xilinx FPGAs to nearly instantaneously change hardware internals of our cipher implementation for improved resistance against side-channel attacks.

One class of techniques to combat these threats is logic encryption. Logic encryption modifies an IC design such that it operates correctly only when a set of newly introduced inputs, called key inputs, are set to the correct values. In this paper, we use algorithms based on satisfiability checking (SAT) to investigate the security of logic encryption. We present a SAT-based algorithm which allows an attacker to \u201cdecrypt\u201d an encrypted netlist using a small number of carefully-selected input patterns and their corresponding output observations. We also present a \u201cpartial-break\u201d algorithm that can reveal some of the key inputs even when the attack is not fully successful. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our attack by examining six proposals for logic encryption from the literature. We find that all of these are vulnerable to our attack. Among the 441 encrypted circuits we examined, we were able to decrypt 418 (95%). We discuss the strengths and limitations of our attack and suggest directions that may lead to improved logic encryption algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2015.7140252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2015.7140252","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7119893/7140225/07140252.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the security of logic encryption algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the security of logic encryption algorithms","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140252/","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277767","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140252/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the security of logic encryption algorithms","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP026051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05778S","chronDate":"5-7 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7119893","isNumber":"7140225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7119893","citationCount":"279","xplore-issue":"7140225","articleId":"7140252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7140253,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In fact, the batch mapping of virtual networks will enhance the cumulative Cloud provider's revenue thanks to the global view of the incoming requests during a predefined time slot. Hence, the differentiation between requests can be performed and the arrival order of requests is ignored. The embedding of one virtual network is NP-hard. Adding the batch processing of the requests will further increase the complexity of the problem. In order to skirt the exponential complexity, we formulate the problem as building and researching problems within a decision tree. To resolve it, we propose a novel reliable batch-embedding virtual network strategy denoted by BR-VNE. It is based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search optimization method in which the upper confidence bounds can be reached in polynomial time. Based on extensive simulations, the results obtained show that BR-VNE outperforms the related work in terms of i) acceptance rate of virtual network requests, ii) Cloud provider's revenue and iii) rate of requests impacted by physical failures within the Cloud's backbone.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140274.pdf","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A batch approach for a survivable virtual network embedding based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140274","startPage":"36","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A batch approach for a survivable virtual network embedding based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140274/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15277870","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140274/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A batch approach for a survivable virtual network embedding based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068706S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140275,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong T.

We formulate a price competition between cloud broker and public provider as a two-stage non-cooperative game. In stage one, where cloud service providers set their service prices to maximize their revenue, we use the Nash equilibrium concept to study the equilibria for the price setting game. Cloud users can select the services (from the cloud broker or public provider) that provide them the best payoff in terms of performance (i.e., delay) and price. To that end, cloud users can adapt their service selection behavior by observing the variations in price and quality of service offered by the different cloud service providers. For the service selection game of cloud users in stage two, we use the evolutionary game model to study the evolution and the dynamic behavior of cloud users. Furthermore, the Wardrop equilibrium and replicator dynamics is applied to determine the equilibrium and its convergence properties of the service selection game. Numerical results illustrate that our game model captures the main factors behind the heterogeneous market cloud pricing and service selection, thus represents a promising framework for the design and understanding of the heterogeneous market cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140275.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward service selection game in a heterogeneous market cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Cloud computing","Pricing","Delays","Nash equilibrium","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","game theory","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service selection game","heterogeneous market cloud computing","noncooperative game","cloud service provider","Nash equilibrium","Wardrop equilibrium","replicator dynamics","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Toward service selection game in a heterogeneous market cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140275/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277901","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward service selection game in a heterogeneous market cloud computing","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098188S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140280,"authors":[{"name":"Windhya Rankothge","affiliation":["Universitat Pompeu Fabra"],"firstName":"Windhya","lastName":"Rankothge","id":"37085400928"},{"name":"Jiefei Ma","affiliation":["Imperial College"],"firstName":"Jiefei","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085409775"},{"name":"Franck Le","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Le","id":"37944641900"},{"name":"Alessandra Russo","affiliation":["Imperial College"],"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Russo","id":"37276019800"},{"name":"Jorge Lobo","affiliation":["ICREA-Universitat, Pompeu, Fabra"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Lobo","id":"37356364500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140280","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":852},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Resource management","Elasticity","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer network management","genetic algorithms","quality of service","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network function virtualization","cloud computing service","commodity hardware","NFV","service models","telecommunication service providers","enterprises","service chaining algorithm","VM allocation","network management","VM placement","network configuration","network resources","SLA","Qos requirements","genetic algorithm","GA approach","virtual machine"]}],"abstract":"By allowing network functions to be virtualized and run on commodity hardware, NFV enables new properties (e.g., elastic scaling), and new service models for Service Providers, Enterprises, and Telecommunication Service Providers. However, for NFV to be offered as a service, several research problems still need to be addressed. In this paper, we focus and propose a new service chaining algorithm. Existing solutions suffer two main limitations: First, existing proposals often rely on mixed Integer Linear Programming to optimize VM allocation and network management, but our experiments show that such approach is too slow taking hours to find a solution. Second, although existing proposals have considered the VM placement and network configuration jointly, they frequently assume the network configuration cannot be changed. Instead, we believe that both computing and network resources should be able to be updated concurrently for increased flexibility and to satisfy SLA and Qos requirements. As such, we formulate and propose a Genetic Algorithm based approach to solve the VM allocation and network management problem. We built an experimental NFV platform, and run a set of experiments. The results show that our proposed GA approach can compute configurations to to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards making network function virtualization a cloud computing service","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140280","startPage":"89","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140280.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards making network function virtualization a cloud computing service","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140280/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277846","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards making network function virtualization a cloud computing service","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061065S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140281,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Caggiani Luizelli","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics-Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)"],"firstName":"Marcelo Caggiani","lastName":"Luizelli","id":"37085350511"},{"name":"Leonardo Richter Bays","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics-Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)"],"firstName":"Leonardo Richter","lastName":"Bays","id":"38529045800"},{"name":"Luciana Salete Buriol","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics-Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)"],"firstName":"Luciana Salete","lastName":"Buriol","id":"37691497600"},{"name":"Marinho Pilla Barcellos","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics-Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)"],"firstName":"Marinho Pilla","lastName":"Barcellos","id":"37303927400"},{"name":"Luciano Paschoal Gaspary","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics-Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)"],"firstName":"Luciano Paschoal","lastName":"Gaspary","id":"37324591500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140281","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":217,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3083},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Middleboxes","Hardware","Bandwidth","Virtualization","Linear programming","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","resource allocation","software defined networking","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NFV provisioning puzzle","network function virtualization","virtual network functions","hardware-based network function processing","commoditized hardware","network function provisioning","service function chains","SFC","resource allocation","resource provisioning","end-to-end delays","middlebox-based networks","network function placement and chaining problem","integer linear programming","ILP model"]}],"abstract":"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising network architecture concept, in which virtualization technologies are employed to manage networking functions via software as opposed to having to rely on hardware to handle these functions. By shifting dedicated, hardware-based network function processing to software running on commoditized hardware, NFV has the potential to make the provisioning of network functions more flexible and cost-effective, to mention just a few anticipated benefits. Despite consistent initial efforts to make NFV a reality, little has been done towards efficiently placing virtual network functions and deploying service function chains (SFC). With respect to this particular research problem, it is important to make sure resource allocation is carefully performed and orchestrated, preventing over- or under-provisioning of resources and keeping end-to-end delays comparable to those observed in traditional middlebox-based networks. In this paper, we formalize the network function placement and chaining problem and propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to solve it. Additionally, in order to cope with large infrastructures, we propose a heuristic procedure for efficiently guiding the ILP solver towards feasible, near-optimal solutions. Results show that the proposed model leads to a reduction of up to 25% in end-to-end delays (in comparison to chainings observed in traditional infrastructures) and an acceptable resource over-provisioning limited to 4%. Further, we demonstrate that our heuristic approach is able to find solutions that are very close to optimality while delivering results in a timely manner.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140281","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140281.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piecing together the NFV provisioning puzzle: Efficient placement and chaining of virtual network functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Piecing together the NFV provisioning puzzle: Efficient placement and chaining of virtual network functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140281/","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15277875","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piecing together the NFV provisioning puzzle: Efficient placement and chaining of virtual network functions","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04705S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7140294,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Heleno Isolani","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brasil"],"firstName":"Pedro Heleno","lastName":"Isolani","id":"37085491834"},{"name":"Juliano Araujo Wickboldt","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brasil"],"firstName":"Juliano Araujo","lastName":"Wickboldt","id":"37946401100"},{"name":"Cristiano Bonato Both","affiliation":["University of Santa Cruz do Sul, Santa Cruz do Sul, Brasil"],"firstName":"Cristiano Bonato","lastName":"Both","id":"37680719900"},{"name":"Juergen Rochol","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brasil"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Rochol","id":"37443624400"},{"name":"Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brasil"],"firstName":"Lisandro Zambenedetti","lastName":"Granville","id":"37085359533"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140294","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Visualization","Switches","Process control","Prototypes","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","computer network performance evaluation","protocols","software defined networking","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN interactive monitoring","SDN visualization","SDN configuration","OpenFlow-based SDN","software-defined networking","network innovation","network management loop","resource consumption","traffic forwarding performance","SDN traffic control","controller-forwarding device communication","SDN management","SDN-related parameters","network performance"]}],"abstract":"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that arguably facilitates network innovation and simplifies network management. However, in the context of SDN, management activities, such as monitoring, visualization, and configuration can be considerably different from traditional networks. An SDN controller, for example, can be customized by network administrators according to their needs. Such customizations might pose an impact on resource consumption and traffic forwarding performance, which is difficult to assess without an SDN-devoted management system. In this paper, we initially present an analysis of control traffic in SDN aiming to better understand the impact of the communication between the controller and forwarding devices. Afterwards, we propose an interactive approach to SDN management through monitoring, visualization, and configuration that includes the administrator in the management loop. To show the feasibility of our approach a prototype has been developed. The results obtained with this prototype show that our approach can help the administrator to better understand the impact of configuring SDN-related parameters on the overall network performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive monitoring, visualization, and configuration of OpenFlow-based SDN","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140294","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140294.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interactive monitoring, visualization, and configuration of OpenFlow-based SDN","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140294/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277935","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive monitoring, visualization, and configuration of OpenFlow-based SDN","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113515S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140333,"authors":[{"name":"Go Hasegawa","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Go","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37271811300"},{"name":"Takanori Iwai","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Kanagawa, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Takanori","lastName":"Iwai","id":"37085447283"},{"name":"Naoki Wakamiya","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Wakamiya","id":"37299671200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140333","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"Machine Type Communications (MTC) has been paid much attention as a new communication paradigm to increase mobile network traffic. Most of MTC terminals are time-driven, that is, they send and receive data periodically. Therefore, network access requests on mobile core networks are concentrated at a specific timing, which results in instantaneous increase in network load. Considering the fact that such time-driven MTC would accept a certain amount of latency in their cyclic communication, in this paper, we propose a scheduling method of communication timings of time-driven MTC terminals to mitigate traffic concentration. We extend the standardized back-off mechanism of 3GPP to configure the back-off time length for each terminal to decrease the number of concurrent bearers in the network, while satisfying requirements on communication latency. We compare proposed methods by simulation experiments and reveal that we can achieve almost zero access rejections at reasonable communication quality by a simple timeslot selection algorithm when the core network maintain the timeslot assignment status for accommodated User Equipments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to alleviate short-term congestion of mobile core networks by MTC with TDMA-like network control.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Timing","Load management","Servers","Wireless networks","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine type communications","mobile network traffic","network access requests","mobile core networks","cyclic communication","scheduling method","time-driven MTC terminals","traffic concentration","standardized back-off mechanism","3GPP","back-off time length","communication latency","timeslot selection algorithm","timeslot assignment status","user equipments","short-term congestion","TDMA-like network control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140333","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140333.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal load balancing of time-driven machine type communications in mobile core networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal load balancing of time-driven machine type communications in mobile core networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140333/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140333/","accessionNumber":"15277970","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal load balancing of time-driven machine type communications in mobile core networks","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064366S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7140351,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.R.

First, fluctuating workloads cause traditional application models to change over time. Moreover, modeling the behaviors of complex applications always requires domain knowledge which is difficult to obtain. Finally, managing large-scale applications manually is impractical for operators. This paper addresses these issues and proposes an automatic fault diagnosis method for Web applications in cloud computing. We propose an online incremental clustering method to recognize access behavior patterns, and uses CCA to model the correlation between workloads and the metrics of application performance/resource utilization in a specific access behavior pattern. Our method detects anomalies by discovering the abrupt change of correlation coefficients with a EWMA control chart, and then locates suspicious metrics using a feature selection method combining ReliefF and SVM-RFE. We validate our method by injecting typical faults in TPC-W an industry-standard benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that it can effectively detect typical faults.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140351","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140351.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection for cloud computing systems with correlation analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140351/","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection for cloud computing systems with correlation analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277910","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140351/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection for cloud computing systems with correlation analysis","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076846S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140372,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe A.

One reason to this interest is that SDN enables the network programmability, through an external controller, which supports applications and policies built from SDN programming languages, thus breaking the traditional bind between control and data plane. Nevertheless, the application development in this context is still complex for such recent technology. Moreover, there is a strong need for methodologies and tools that explore the abstraction levels potentials supported by SDN. This paper presents a new approach based on the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm, called Model-Driven Networking (MDN). MDN relies on a Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) to create SDN applications. We argue that MDN raises the level of abstraction on development, thus reducing the complexity to implement SDN applications and avoiding inconsistent policies.

We discuss our testing methodology and provide measurement results for the test cases where an application faces various security attacks.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140374","startPage":"778","endPage":"781","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140374.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security function virtualization in software defined infrastructure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Security function virtualization in software defined infrastructure","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140374/","accessionNumber":"15277861","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140374/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security function virtualization in software defined infrastructure","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0452S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7140375,"authors":[{"name":"Spandan Bemby","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Spandan","lastName":"Bemby","id":"37085453991"},{"name":"Hongbin Lu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085455836"},{"name":"Khashayar Hossein Zadeh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Khashayar Hossein","lastName":"Zadeh","id":"37085470009"},{"name":"Hadi Bannazadeh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Bannazadeh","id":"38269966600"},{"name":"Alberto Leon-Garcia","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Leon-Garcia","id":"38270617400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Topology","Containers","IP networks","Overlay networks","Linux","Virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","cloud computing","Linux","local area networks","overlay networks","software defined networking","telecommunication network topology","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ViNO","virtual network overlay","SDN overlay","heterogeneous infrastructure","orchestration service","arbitrary network topologies","OVS switches","Open vSwitch switches","VMs","VXLAN encapsulation","API calls","domain specific language","Linux services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orchestration","SDN","Cloud computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140375","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140375.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ViNO: SDN overlay to allow seamless migration across heterogeneous infrastructure","abstract":"We propose ViNO (Virtual Network Overlay), an orchestration service that can be used to create arbitrary network topologies with OVS (Open vSwitch) switches and VMs. ViNO connects switches and VMs through an overlay network using VXLAN encapsulation.

This is mainly due to the scale of the cloud and the number of services deployed in it. Since cloud users and service providers are given access to supercomputerlevel resources, their effect over the cloud's overall performance is greater than ever. This raises multiple research questions related to the management and performance of cloud computing systems in light of the end-users selfishness. In this work we specifically study the overall performance when selfish service providers may split work between the (shared) cloud and private resources. The size of modern data center and the number of service housed in it calls for fully distributed management solutions. We propose task assignment policies that are specifically adequate for large-scale distributed systems, and show that they provide new capabilities in improving system performance. In particular, we develop new resource allocation algorithms that converge to a working point that balances the end-user experience with the operational costs of leasing resources from the cloud provider.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Load modeling","Cloud computing","Delays","Games","Load management","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","resource management","cloud computing","cloud resource","private resource","data center","distributed management solutions","task assignment policies","distributed systems","system performance improvement","operational costs","resource leasing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140436","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140436","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1084","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140436/","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation and management in Cloud Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15278014","htmlLink":"/document/7140436/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation and management in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095139S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140448,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Rezaee","affiliation":["Dept.

A Software Defined Networking (SDN) control plane can configure the FPGA controllers to establish deterministic GR connections in a forwarding plane of IP routers or layer-2 packet switches. The use of deterministic GR connections can reduce queueing delays to negligible values, so that the end-to-end delays are reduced to the fiber latency. The switch controller can operate routers, switches and links at 100% loads, while simultaneously guaranteeing very low end-to-end queueing delays. A testbed consisting of 8 switches in a linear array is synthesized on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. An SDN control plane routes 128 traffic flows through the testbed to saturate the switches and links. Packets move through the forwarding plane at a clock rate of 52 MHz, transferring millions of packets per second, and statistics are recorded. The demonstration shows that all traffic flows in the testbed achieve deterministic GR service. The FPGA demonstration is accompanied by a video which visually illustrates packet forwarding in the network.

Since the capacity of cache on each network node is limited, numbers of cache replacement algorithm have been proposed. However, because of previous methods do not consider the rapid fluctuation of content demand, ineffectual cache of content remains which cause a waste usage of cache capacity. In this paper, we propose the method of using the prediction result of content demand. We first demonstrate that by applying prediction can improve the efficiency of cache utilization. However, predicting the demand of whole contents is not realistic in the aspect of computational cost. We therefore propose the method of reducing computational cost greatly without lack of cache efficiency. We demonstrate that by simulating with real monitored data, cache hit rate can be increased about 1.6 times. Furthermore, we show that our method has advantage in many aspects, such as efficient usage of cache and content deployment based on its popularity in the whole network by comparing with other existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140462.pdf","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1176","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching algorithm for content-oriented networks using prediction of popularity of contents","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Time series analysis","Computational efficiency","Conferences","Accuracy","Predictive models","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","content management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["caching algorithm","content-oriented networks","content popularity prediction","content deployment","server load reduction","latency","ICN","information centric networking","cache replacement algorithm","cache capacity","content demand","cache utilization","computational cost reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Caching algorithm for content-oriented networks using prediction of popularity of contents","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140462/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277879","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching algorithm for content-oriented networks using prediction of popularity of contents","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050038S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140463,"authors":[{"name":"Ted H.

An SDN control-plane can create deterministic GR connections in a forwarding-plane of electrical or optical packet switches, where end-to-end delays are reduced to the fiber latency. A testbed for the proposed deterministic GR technology is presented. A forwarding-plane consisting of 8 controllers and minimum-complexity packet-switches are synthesized on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. An SDN control plane routes 128 traffic flows through the forwarding plane, which saturate the packet-switches. Several deterministic schedules are precomputed and loaded into the controller lookup tables, which control each packet-switch for each time-slot in a scheduling frame. The FPGA testbed is clocked at 52 MHz, allowing millions of packet transfers per second, and statistics are recorded. The testbed confirms the establishment of deterministic GR transport connections configured on a programmable underlay network, where the end-to-end delays are effectively reduced to the fiber latency. An inexpensive FPGA controller can add deterministic GR services to IP routers, MPLS, Ethernet, InfiniBand and Fibre channel switches, and layer-2 electrical or optical packet-switches, spanning 100s of nodes over distances of 1000s of miles.

Along with this trend, expectations and requirements of users rise as well. For example, users do not want to compromise on comfortable daily routines as available on desktop computers. However, an intrinsic characteristic of mobile devices is their limited availability of resources (e.g., CPU, storage, bandwidth, energy) hindering in particular computation-intensive tasks. In this scenario, mobile cloud computing (MCC) promises to overcome these limitations by offering apparently infinite resources in the infrastructure that are transparently accessible also for mobile applications. In order to easily benefit from these offerings, dynamic code offloading has been proposed by several approaches recently. However, such solutions either do not consider the complexity arising from the dynamically changing context in mobile environments adequately or have a steep learning curve inhibiting easy adoption by developers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach towards context-adaptive mobile cloud computing. For that, first an extensive requirements analysis was conducted merging ISO standards with users', applications' and developers' needs. Based on this, an evaluation of related MCC-approaches allowed identifying promising concepts as well as current shortcomings. As a result, an MCC-framework, called CloudAware, is proposed that eases the development of MCC-applications by offering programming abstractions, multi-level distribution transparency, context adaptation features and is hands-free for end-users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Mobile communication","Mobile handsets","Cloud computing","Bandwidth","Conferences","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","ISO standards","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CloudAware","context-adaptive mobile cloud computing","context-adaptive MCC","mobile devices","dynamic code offloading","ISO standards","programming abstractions","multilevel distribution transparency","context adaptation features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140465","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140465","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1195","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140465.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140465/","displayDocTitle":"CloudAware: Towards context-adaptive mobile cloud computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15277862","htmlLink":"/document/7140465/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CloudAware: Towards context-adaptive mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066094S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140467,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen B.

We propose a new VANET architecture called FSDN which combines two emergent computing and network paradigm Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Fog Computing as a prospective solution. SDN-based architecture provides flexibility, scalability, programmability and global knowledge while Fog Computing offers delay-sensitive and location-awareness services which could be satisfy the demands of future VANETs scenarios. We figure out all the SDN-based VANET components as well as their functionality in the system. We also consider the system basic operations in which Fog Computing are leveraged to support surveillance services by taking into account resource manager and Fog orchestration models. The proposed architecture could resolve the main challenges in VANETs by augmenting Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Base Station communications and SDN centralized control while optimizing resources utility and reducing latency by integrating Fog Computing.

Our evaluation based on the real network data shows very good performance of such a learning model being able to capture the cell behavior in time and multidimensional space. Such knowledge can improve the detection of different types of anomalies in cell functionality and enhance the process of cell failure mitigation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140483.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1291","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved anomaly detection in mobile networks by using incremental time-aware clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Testing","Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Training","Clustering algorithms","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","mobile computing","mobility management (mobile radio)","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile network management","anomaly detection","incremental time-aware clustering","mobile network complexity","network troubleshooting","mobile network cell","learning model","multidimensional space","cell failure mitigation process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An improved anomaly detection in mobile networks by using incremental time-aware clustering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15277905","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved anomaly detection in mobile networks by using incremental time-aware clustering","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041487S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140484,"authors":[{"name":"Eloy Martinez","affiliation":["Network Management Laboratory, Ireland"],"firstName":"Eloy","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37085652741"},{"name":"Enda Fallon","affiliation":["Network Management Laboratory, Ericsson, Athlone, Ireland"],"firstName":"Enda","lastName":"Fallon","id":"37568494900"},{"name":"Sheila Fallon","affiliation":["Network Management Laboratory, Ericsson, Athlone, Ireland"],"firstName":"Sheila","lastName":"Fallon","id":"37393089000"},{"name":"MingXue Wang","affiliation":["Software Research Institute, Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Westmeath, IE"],"firstName":"MingXue","lastName":"Wang","id":"38546906600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140484","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunications","Search engines","Conferences","Detection algorithms","Indexes","Big data","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","search engines","security of data","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADAMANT","anomaly detection algorithm for maintenance and network troubleshooting","network operators","network performance","telecommunications analytical applications","SQL","complex event processing","CEP","data processing","network analysis","telecommunications domain","telecommunications data structures","additional_info","user_text","problem_text","text analytic based network anomaly detection approach","telecommunications data records","distance based outlier detection","sliding windows","abnormal terms detection","configurable time intervals","text documents","Twitter feeds","network state","search engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["outlier","text anomaly","distance based","sliding windows","search Engine"]}],"abstract":"Network operators are increasingly using analytic applications to improve the performance of their networks. Telecommunications analytical applications typically use SQL and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for data processing, network analysis and troubleshooting. Such approaches are hindered as they require an in-depth knowledge of both the telecommunications domain and telecommunications data structures in order to create the required queries. Valuable information contained in free form text data fields such as \u201cadditional_info\u201d, \u201cuser_text\u201d or \u201cproblem_text\u201d can also be ignored. This work proposes An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting (ADAMANT), a text analytic based network anomaly detection approach. Once telecommunications data records have been indexed, ADAMANT uses distance based outlier detection within sliding windows to detect abnormal terms at configurable time intervals. Traditional approaches focus on a specific type of record and create specific cause and effect rules. With the ADAMANT approach all free form text fields of alarms, logs, etc. are treated as text documents similar to Twitter feeds. All documents within a window represent a snapshot of the network state that is processed by ADAMANT. The ADAMANT approach focuses on text analytics to provide automated analysis without the requirement for SQL/CEP queries. Such an approach provides distinct network insights in comparison to traditional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140484","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140484.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADAMANT \u2014 An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140484/","displayDocTitle":"ADAMANT \u2014 An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278025","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140484/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADAMANT \u2014 An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077124S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140490,"authors":[{"name":"Till Neudecker","affiliation":["Institute of Telematics & Steinbuch Centre for Computing Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Till","lastName":"Neudecker","id":"37085565405"},{"name":"Philipp Andelfinger","affiliation":["Institute of Telematics & Steinbuch Centre for Computing Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Andelfinger","id":"37545477200"},{"name":"Hannes Hartenstein","affiliation":["Institute of Telematics & Steinbuch Centre for Computing Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Hartenstein","id":"37279300400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8241-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1573-0077"}],"articleNumber":"7140490","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":991},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Online banking","Message systems","Computational modeling","Analytical models","IP networks","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","electronic money","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation model","attacks analysis","bitcoin peer-to-peer network","distributed electronic currency system","unmodified code","core segments","bitcoin reference implementation","message propagation","attacking nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140490","abstract":"We present a simulation model of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, a widely deployed distributed electronic currency system.

Cloud systems also provide powerful tools such as virtual machine (VM) based replication for defending mission-critical applications. However, cloud-based mission-critical computing raises serious challenges to mission assurance. VM-based consolidation brings different applications to the same set of physical resources, increasing the risk of one user compromising the mission of another. The mission-critical application in a VM lacks the visibility and control to detect and stop outside malicious attacks, whereas the support for security isolation from existing cloud systems is also limited. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to address these challenges and improve the survivability of mission-critical applications through the novel use of VM replication. Specifically, this paper presents a new multi-level VM replication approach which uses different types of VM clones to provide a variety of protections to mission-critical applications, and improve the survivability of the applications under accidental faults and malicious attacks. In this approach, full VM clones are employed to provide tolerance of attacks, decoy clones are created to divert attacks, and honeypot clones are used to analyze attacks. The paper also presents the prototypes of the proposed approach implemented for the widely used OpenStack-based private cloud systems and Amazon-EC2-based public cloud systems.","doi":"10.1109/INM.2015.7140494","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7121095/7140257/07140494.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INM.2015.7140494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-level VM replication based survivability for mission-critical cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140494/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-level VM replication based survivability for mission-critical cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15285682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140494/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-level VM replication based survivability for mission-critical cloud computing","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071094S","chronDate":"11-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7121095","isNumber":"7140257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7121095","xplore-issue":"7140257","articleId":"7140494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140535,"authors":[{"name":"Graeme Bathurst","affiliation":["RXPE, UK"],"firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Bathurst"},{"name":"George Hwang","affiliation":["RXPE, UK/Dubai"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Hwang"},{"name":"Lalit Tejwani","affiliation":["RXPE, India"],"firstName":"Lalit","lastName":"Tejwani"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-982-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7140535","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1129},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC power transmission","power convertors","power distribution control","power supply quality","reactive power control","short-circuit currents","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network","MVDC","power quality","short-circuit level","loop flow","phase-angle difference","4-quadrant converter","reactive power","voltage control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MVDC","Distribution","Soft open-point","VSC"]}],"abstract":"MVDC is starting to be considered as an option for enhancing transfer capacity and providing increased power quality at distribution networks.

The 4-quadrant converters can provide reactive power support and voltage control at each end of the link and multi-terminal is also feasible. There are future technology opportunities including enhancement of existing corridors through the conversion of existing AC lines to DC.

An HVDC grid will be required to operate the healthy lines continuously, even if a voltage collapse occurs at the remote end. Rapid fault clearing is essential for DC Circuit Breaker (DCCB) even though the requirement varies depending on DC transmission system configurations, Voltage Source Converter (VSC) design, transmission capacity, and DC reactor connected in series with the line/cable, etc. In this paper, the requirements for DCCB were analytically evaluated using a four-terminal radial HVDC network model. The results show that DC fault interruption current and fault clearing time are achievable by using a mechanical DCCB with the forced current zero formation scheme. Furthermore, interruption performance of the mechanical DCCB composed of HV vacuum interrupter was evaluated. This DC circuit breaker successfully interrupted a current equivalent of up to 16 kA DC in the laboratory. The prototype adopts forced current zero formation scheme and comprises of a high-voltage AC vacuum circuit breaker at transmission voltages connected to an external capacitor equipped with a triggering gap. A series of interruption tests performed on this breaker verified the clearance of short circuit currents as high as 16 kA DC within a few ms after an opening command.","publicationTitle":"11th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission","displayPublicationTitle":"11th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission","pdfPath":"/iel7/7122717/7122718/07140552.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HVDC circuit breakers for HVDC grid applications","doi":"10.1049/cp.2015.0018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2015.0018","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"HVDC circuit breakers for HVDC grid applications","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2015","publicationDate":"February 2015","accessionNumber":"15163968","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HVDC circuit breakers for HVDC grid applications","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20150018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029515S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2015","isNumber":"7122718","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7122717","citationCount":"89","articleId":"7140552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7140602,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In the recent past research interest in HVDC grids has increased, leading to a multitude of studies concerning dc power flow and optimal power flow, dynamics and HVDC grid protection. However, each of these studies makes use of different grid topologies, configurations and transmission line parameters. In this paper, a standard HVDC grid test system is proposed and an implementation in EMT-type software is provided. The implementation in EMT-type software makes use of a frequency dependent cable model, continuous converter model and a reduced dc breaker model.

We apply an information theory to detect target with poor signal quality in dynamic forest-environment. This method is motivated by the fact that echoes from the stationary target that is obscured by foliage has strong random characteristics. This is resolved by three steps of information fusion. For the first step of information fusion, we use Kullback-Leibler divergence-based weighting and generated a modified histogram. In the second step, we use entropy- and mutual information-based information fusion. Finally, we use three different fusion methods: 1) Dempster and Shafer theory of evidence; 2) proportional conflict redistribution rule 5; and 3) Bayesian network for decision fusion. Results show that when echoes are in poor quality, accurate detection can be achieved by applying our method. To demonstrate that our algorithm could be applied to other scenarios, we apply it to sense-through-wall human detection using different UWB radars, and simulation results show that our approach works well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2451160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7181761/07140722.pdf","endPage":"5937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistep Information Fusion for Target Detection Using UWB Radar Sensor Network","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2451160","startPage":"5927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multistep Information Fusion for Target Detection Using UWB Radar Sensor Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140722/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15378963","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140722/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0043"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1247848, CNS-1116749 and CNS-0964713"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistep Information Fusion for Target Detection Using UWB Radar Sensor Network","sourcePdf":"jsen-maherin-2451160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085753S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7181761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7181761","articleId":"7140722","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7140728,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Iliev","affiliation":["Micromechatronics Systems Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7181761/7140728/iliev-2450742-small.gif","p":["Nick Iliev received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Irvine.

This paper provides a comprehensive review and comparison of recent implementations (commercial and academic) of physical measurement techniques used in sensor localization, and of the localization algorithms that use these measurement techniques. Physical methods for measuring distances and angles between WSN nodes are reviewed, followed by a comprehensive comparison of localization accuracy, applicable ranges, node dimensions, and power consumption of the different implementations. A summary of advantages and disadvantages of each measurement technique is provided, along with a comparison of colocalization methods in WSNs across multiple algorithms and distance ranges. A discussion of possible improvements to accuracy, range, and power consumption of selected self-localization methods is included in the concluding discussion. Although the preferred implementation depends on the application, required accuracy, and range, passive optical triangulation is reported as the most energy efficient localization method for low-cost/low-power miniature sensor nodes. It is capable of providing micrometer-level resolution, however, the applicable range (internode distance) is limited to single centimeters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15378973","htmlLink":"/document/7140728/","displayDocTitle":"Review and Comparison of Spatial Localization Methods for Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"College of Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review and Comparison of Spatial Localization Methods for Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-iliev-2450742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144579S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7181761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7181761","articleId":"7140728","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140735,"authors":[{"name":"Chunpo Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Chunpo","lastName":"Pan","id":"37406176200"},{"name":"Henning B\u00fclow","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"B\u00fclow","id":"37277849000"},{"name":"Wilfried Idler","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Idler","id":"37279809800"},{"name":"Laurent Schmalen","affiliation":["Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Schmalen","id":"37397871100"},{"name":"Frank R.

This approach raises several problems due to the tight coupling between network and data access points, as well as the paradigm shift towards data-oriented services, heterogeneous deployments and network densification. A logical separation between control and data planes is seen as a promising solution that could overcome these issues, by providing data services under the umbrella of a coverage layer. This article presents a holistic survey of existing literature on the control-data separation architecture (CDSA) for cellular radio access networks. As a starting point, we discuss the fundamentals, concepts, and general structure of the CDSA. Then, we point out limitations of the conventional architecture in futuristic deployment scenarios. In addition, we present and critically discuss the work that has been done to investigate potential benefits of the CDSA, as well as its technical challenges and enabling technologies. Finally, an overview of standardisation proposals related to this research vision is provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/07140736.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2451514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2451514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control-Data Separation Architecture for Cellular Radio Access Networks: A Survey and Outlook","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite broadcasting","Computer architecture","Data communication","Radio access networks","Interference","MIMO","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDSA","data-oriented service","data access point","wireless channel","cellular radio access network","control-data separation architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G cellular systems","context awareness","dual connectivity"]},{"kwd":["5G cellular systems","context awareness","control data separation","dual connectivity","energy efficiency","network densification","radio access networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Control-Data Separation Architecture for Cellular Radio Access Networks: A Survey and Outlook","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7140736/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","accessionNumber":"15752724","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"5-1047-2437"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control-Data Separation Architecture for Cellular Radio Access Networks: A Survey and Outlook","sourcePdf":"comst-mohamed-2451514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174654S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7140736","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140743,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Marey","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Marey","id":"38360778600"},{"name":"Octavia A.

Traditional packet classification that considers only 5-tuple fields is not sufficient for today's complicated network requirements. OpenFlow switch was born to take care of these complex requirements using a rule set with the rich definition as the software-hardware interface. This paper considers OpenFlow1.0, consisting of 12-tuple header fields. We propose two schemes to process the range fields. The first scheme has the same characteristic as StrideBV [15] using specially designed codes to store the pre-computed results in memory. The second scheme uses a simple sub-range comparison method to find the matching result in a sequential fashion. To show the performance and compare with other proposed schemes, we implement the proposed schemes on Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX760 FPGA device. Experimental results show that our designs can handle 5 K more OpenFlow rules on Virtex-6 XC6VLX760. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first range supported method that can sustain the throughputs of more than 380 MHz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-Enhanced Packet Classification Design on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2449666","startPage":"214","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2449666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7484805/07140750.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Range-Enhanced Packet Classification Design on FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7140750/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2016","accessionNumber":"16055094","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-Enhanced Packet Classification Design on FPGA","sourcePdf":"tetc-chang-2449666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095311S","chronDate":"April-June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7484805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7484805","articleId":"7140750","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140766,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek A.

Oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) use either frequency or phase as state variables to implement frequency-shift keying (FSK)- and phase-shift keying (PSK)-based neural networks, respectively. To make these ONNs power and area efficient, back-end-of-the-line compatible, and capable of processing multilevel information, we explore an emerging class of oscillators that show fine-grain frequency-tuning and phase-coupling. We examine TaOx- and TiOx-based oscillators (resistive random access memory-type) as elements of a neuromorphic compute block and experimentally demonstrate: 1) frequency control over four decades using a ballast MOSFET; 2) variable phase coupling between oscillators; and 3) variable phase programming between oscillators coupled with a MOSFET. Such fine-grain control over both frequency and relative phase serve as the desirable characteristics of oscillators required for multilevel information processing in star-type directly coupled FSK- and PSK-based neuromorphic systems that find applications in gray-scale image processing and other graphical compute paradigms.

To reduce complexity, which can become prohibitive for large network size, we examine the performance-complexity tradeoffs involved in a sparse equalizer design. Joint precoder and equalizer optimization requires alternation between the forward and reverse links and assumes perfect synchronization between the transmitters and receivers at each network node, resulting in extensive overhead and spectral efficiency loss. To overcome this serious drawback, we propose a new design approach based on weighted-sum-rate maximization assuming a virtual equalizer type at the transmitter to limit the optimization process to the transmitter side. In addition, we quantify the sum-rate loss due to mismatched equalizer types and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed sum-rate weighting strategy to such mismatches with perfect or imperfect channel knowledge. Finally, we derive asymptotic performance expressions and verify their accuracy numerically even for a moderate number of users.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07140769.pdf","startPage":"3645","endPage":"3659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for the Multi-Stream MIMO Interference Channel With Sparse Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140769/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for the Multi-Stream MIMO Interference Channel With Sparse Equalization","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524651","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140769/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Cisco Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for the Multi-Stream MIMO Interference Channel With Sparse Equalization","sourcePdf":"tcomm-helmy-2451092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131743S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7140769","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140777,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085510494"},{"name":"Baoyun Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Baoyun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292887200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7140777","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":815},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","MIMO","Wireless communication","Optimization","Communication system security","Iterative methods","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wiretap channels","SWIPT","three-node multiple-input-multiple-output wiretap channels","wireless information","power transfer","covariance optimization","energy-harvesting maximization","secrecy rate","transmit power","Taylor series expansion","energy receiver","Bernstein-type inequality-based iterative algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO wiretap channel","SWIPT","energy har-vesting","Physical-layer security","Bernstein-type inequali"]},{"kwd":["MIMO wiretap channel","SWIPT","energy harvesting","physical-layer security","Bernstein-type inequality"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies transmit optimization in three-node multiple-input-multiple-output wiretap channels with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In particular, we address the transmit covariance optimization for the energy-harvesting maximization (EHM) problem under the constraint of secrecy rate and transmit power. The problem is nonconvex and hard to tackle. To circumvent it, we first resort to the Taylor series expansion to convert the problem into a convex optimization problem. Then, based on the analysis of its dual problem, an iterative algorithm, which includes a semiclosed-form solution, is proposed to handle this EHM problem. The scenario of imperfect channel state information of an energy receiver (the potential eavesdropper) is also considered. In this scenario, a Bernstein-type inequality-based iterative algorithm is proposed to deal with the challenging outage-constrained EHM problem.

Frame-by-frame detection is performed by hierarchical likelihood grids, matching shape templates through a fast oriented distance transform. To allow recovery from misdetections, common heuristics such as nonmaxima suppression within observations is eschewed. Within a discretized state-space, the data association problem is formulated as a grid-based network flow model, resulting in a convex problem casted into an integer linear programming form, giving a global optimal solution. In addition, we show how a behavior cue (body orientation) can be integrated into our association affinity model, providing valuable hints for resolving ambiguities between crossing trajectories. Unlike traditional motion-based approaches, we estimate body orientation by a hybrid methodology, which combines the merits of motion-based and 3D appearance-based orientation estimation, thus being capable of dealing also with still-standing or slowly moving targets. The performance of our method is demonstrated through experiments on a large variety of benchmark video sequences, including both indoor and outdoor scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2451013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2451013","startPage":"4197","endPage":"4212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7131605/07140789.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7131605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Grid-based Multi-People Tracking-by-Detection With Global Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Grid-based Multi-People Tracking-by-Detection With Global Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2015","volume":"24","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140789/","accessionNumber":"15357102","pubMedId":"26151936","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140789/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Grid-based Multi-People Tracking-by-Detection With Global Optimization","sourcePdf":"tip-chen-2451013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099337S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7131605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7131605","articleId":"7140789","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7140793,"authors":[{"name":"Sunil Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085700160"},{"name":"Wenliang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea"],"firstName":"Wenliang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085355201"},{"name":"Zhentao S.

The superiority of the proposed AFPM machine is the material-efficient PM shape, which contributes to obtain a sinusoidal back electromotive force (back EMF) and, hence, reduces the torque pulsations of the machine such as torque ripple. The harmonics present in back EMF have a large influence on iron loss and torque pulsations, which are always unacceptable in the applications involving the speed as high as 1 000 000 r/min. Analytical modeling is first performed to determine the PM shape for the proposed models. Then, the advantages of the proposed models are verified by comparing with the basic model with the conventional ring-shaped PMs using the 3-D finite-element method. The results show that the proposed models have a nearly ideal sinusoidal back-EMF waveform that significantly reduces the torque ripples compared with the basic model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Ultrahigh Speed Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Machine With Sinusoidal Back EMF for Energy Storage Application","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2451162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7305868/07140793.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2451162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of Ultrahigh Speed Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Machine With Sinusoidal Back EMF for Energy Storage Application","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7140793/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","externalId":"8113904","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15553080","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Ultrahigh Speed Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Machine With Sinusoidal Back EMF for Energy Storage Application","sourcePdf":"tmag-kwon-2451162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043149S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7305868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7305868","articleId":"7140793","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140797,"authors":[{"name":"Chaitanya Kumar Matcha","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Chaitanya Kumar","lastName":"Matcha","id":"37085364850"},{"name":"Shayan Garani Srinivasa","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Shayan Garani","lastName":"Srinivasa","id":"37301557600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7140797","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":516},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Jitter","Magnetic recording","Media","Signal processing algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","computational geometry","equalisers","intersymbol interference","magnetic recording","maximum likelihood detection","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized partial response equalization","data dependent noise predictive signal detection","media models","two-dimensional magnetic recording","2D TDMR","2D signal processing","2D intersymbol interference","jitter noise","2D signal detection","combat noise","jitter components","electronic components","partial response maximum likelihood detection","Nyquist rate signaling","2D equalization","filter bank","Voronoi-based granular media","channel bit density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2D SOVA","2D DDNP","2D PRML","TDMR","Media model"]},{"kwd":["2-D data-dependent noise prediction (DDNP)","2-D magnetic recording (TDMR)","2-D partial response maximum likelihood (PRML)","2-D soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA)","media model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2451112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2451112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7270377/07140797.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Partial Response Equalization and Data-Dependent Noise Predictive Signal Detection Over Media Models for TDMR","abstract":"Two-dimensional magnetic recording (2-D TDMR) is an emerging technology that aims to achieve areal densities as high as 10 Tb/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n using sophisticated 2-D signal-processing algorithms. High areal densities are achieved by reducing the size of a bit to the order of the size of magnetic grains, resulting in severe 2-D intersymbol interference (ISI). Jitter noise due to irregular grain positions on the magnetic medium is more pronounced at these areal densities. Therefore, a viable read-channel architecture for TDMR requires 2-D signal-detection algorithms that can mitigate 2-D ISI and combat noise comprising jitter and electronic components. Partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) detection scheme allows controlled ISI as seen by the detector. With the controlled and reduced span of 2-D ISI, the PRML scheme overcomes practical difficulties such as Nyquist rate signaling required for full response 2-D equalization. As in the case of 1-D magnetic recording, jitter noise can be handled using a data-dependent noise-prediction (DDNP) filter bank within a 2-D signal-detection engine. The contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) we empirically study the jitter noise characteristics in TDMR as a function of grain density using a Voronoi-based granular media model; 2) we develop a 2-D DDNP algorithm to handle the media noise seen in TDMR; and 3) we also develop techniques to design 2-D separable and nonseparable targets for generalized partial response equalization for TDMR. This can be used along with a 2-D signal-detection algorithm. The DDNP algorithm is observed to give a 2.5 dB gain in SNR over uncoded data compared with the noise predictive maximum likelihood detection for the same choice of channel model parameters to achieve a channel bit density of 1.3 Tb/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n with media grain center-to-center distance of 10 nm. The DDNP algorithm is observed to give $\\sim$ 10% gain in areal density near 5 grains/bit. The proposed signal-processing framework can broadly scale to various TDMR realizations and areal density points.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"51","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","externalId":"3101215","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456517","htmlLink":"/document/7140797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Partial Response Equalization and Data-Dependent Noise Predictive Signal Detection Over Media Models for TDMR","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Electronics and Information Technology DeitY India","grantNumber":"MITO0101"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology DST India","grantNumber":"SERB/F/3371/2013-14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Partial Response Equalization and Data-Dependent Noise Predictive Signal Detection Over Media Models for TDMR","sourcePdf":"tmag-matcha-2451112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179844S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7270377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7270377","articleId":"7140797","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140804,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7182400/7140804/yang-2450736-small.gif","p":["\n\nJun Yang (M'11) was born in Anlu, China, in 1984.

The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the proposed velocity and the position measurement method outperforms the present methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2444257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7317673/07140814.pdf","startPage":"3387","endPage":"3395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2444257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hysteresis Switch Adaptive Velocity Evaluation and High-Resolution Position Subdivision Detection Based on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140814/","displayDocTitle":"Hysteresis Switch Adaptive Velocity Evaluation and High-Resolution Position Subdivision Detection Based on FPGA","volume":"64","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140814/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15583765","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB035503"},{"fundingName":"China Domestic Research Project through the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Program","grantNumber":"2012GB102006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hysteresis Switch Adaptive Velocity Evaluation and High-Resolution Position Subdivision Detection Based on FPGA","sourcePdf":"tim-huang-2444257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072676S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7317673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7317673","articleId":"7140814","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140818,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7330076/7140818/wen-2443064-small.gif","p":["Guanghui Wen (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical systems and control from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2012.","He was a Research Associate and Post-Doctoral Fellow with the University of New South Wales at Canberra, Campbell, ACT, Australia, from September 2012 to January 2013.

The common assumption in the existing related literature that each possible network topology contains a directed spanning tree is removed in this paper. Using tools from M-matrix theory and stability analysis of the switched nonlinear systems, a new kind of network topology-dependent multiple Lyapunov functions is proposed for analyzing the synchronization behavior of the whole network. It is theoretically shown that the global pinning synchronization in switched complex networks can be ensured if some nodes are appropriately pinned and the coupling is carefully selected. Interesting issues of how many and which nodes should be pinned for possibly realizing global synchronization are further addressed. Finally, some numerical simulations on coupled neural networks are provided to verify the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2443064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2443064","startPage":"3239","endPage":"3250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7330076/07140818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinning Synchronization of Directed Networks With Switching Topologies: A Multiple Lyapunov Functions Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pinning Synchronization of Directed Networks With Switching Topologies: A Multiple Lyapunov Functions Approach","volume":"26","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15602385","pubMedId":"26595418","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140818/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304168 and 61322302"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"BK20130595"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20110092120024"},{"fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks of Jiangsu Province, China","grantNumber":"2014-DZXX-004"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council through the Discovery Scheme","grantNumber":"DP140100544"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinning Synchronization of Directed Networks With Switching Topologies: A Multiple Lyapunov Functions Approach","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wen-2443064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150843S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7330076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"7330076","articleId":"7140818","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7140824,"authors":[{"name":"Pawan Setlur","affiliation":["Wright State Research Inst.","US AFRL, WPAFB, OH"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7140824/7140824-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pawan Setlur (M\u201912) is from Bangalore, India.

In this paper, we consider waveform design for radar space time adaptive processing (STAP), accounting for the waveform dependence of the clutter correlation matrix. Due to this dependence, in general, the joint problem of receiver filter optimization and radar waveform design becomes an intractable, nonconvex optimization problem, Nevertheless, it is, however, shown to be individually convex either in the filter or in the waveform variables. We derive constrained versions of a) the alternating minimization algorithm, b) proximal alternating minimization, and c) the constant modulus alternating minimization, which, at each step, iteratively optimizes either the STAP filter or the waveform independently. A fast and slow time model permits waveform design in radar STAP, but the primary bottleneck is the computational complexity of the algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2451114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07140824.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2451114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Design for Radar STAP in Signal Dependent Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140824/","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Design for Radar STAP in Signal Dependent Interference","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15647657","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140824/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US AFOSR","grantNumber":"13RY10COR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Design for Radar STAP in Signal Dependent Interference","sourcePdf":"tsp-setlur-2451114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228997S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7140824","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140825,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjitha Prasad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7243391/7140825/7140825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ranjitha Prasad received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, India, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, in 2009.

Often, wireless channels are also group approximately cluster-sparse (gac-sparse), i.e., every ga-sparse channel consists of clusters, where a few clusters have all strong components while most clusters have all weak components. In this paper, we cast the problem of estimating the ga-sparse and gac-sparse block-fading and time-varying channels in the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework and propose a bouquet of novel algorithms for pilot-based channel estimation, and joint channel estimation and data detection, in MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed algorithms are capable of estimating the sparse wireless channels even when the measurement matrix is only partially known. Further, we employ a first-order autoregressive modeling of the temporal variation of the ga-sparse and gac-sparse channels and propose a recursive Kalman filtering and smoothing (KFS) technique for joint channel estimation, tracking, and data detection. We also propose novel, parallel-implementation based, low-complexity techniques for estimating gac-sparse channels. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the benefit of exploiting the gac-sparse structure in the wireless channel in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and coded bit error rate (BER) performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2015","volume":"63","issue":"20","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15432970","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7140825/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection in MIMO-OFDM Systems: A Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection in MIMO-OFDM Systems: A Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-murthy-2451071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138351S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7243391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7243391","articleId":"7140825","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7140826,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Ma","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0002-8154-4354","id":"37401705300"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"7140826","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1721},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Inverters","Junctions","Loading","Voltage fluctuations","Reactive power","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","invertors","power grids","power supply quality","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter","3L-NPC inverter","stress redistribution","modulation index","voltage sags","power grid","electric machines","space vector modulation methods","thermal loading","power devices","device loading","junction temperature","DC bus midpoint potential","3L-NPC topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3L-NPC","Modulation","SVM","Neutral point current"]},{"kwd":["Modulation","neutral point current","space vector modulation (SVM)","three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140826","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2451158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2451158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7272758/07140826.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Methods for Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped Inverter Achieving Stress Redistribution Under Moderate Modulation Index","abstract":"This letter investigates the loss and thermal behaviors of a three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) inverter undergoing moderate modulation index, which is typically presented during minor voltage sags of the power grid or speed changes of the electric machines.

Assuming that the corresponding uniformly sampled signal satisfies the Nyquist sampling criterion, the sequence obtained via CNUS can be passed through a reconstructor to recover the missing uniform-grid samples. At present, these reconstructors have very high design and implementation complexity that offsets the gains obtained due to sub-Nyquist sampling. In this paper, we propose a scheme that reduces the design and implementation complexity of the reconstructor. In contrast to the existing reconstructors which use only a multi-channel synthesis filter bank (FB), the proposed reconstructor utilizes both analysis and synthesis FBs which makes it feasitble to achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction of the complexity. The analysis filters are implemented using polyphase networks whose branches are allpass filters with distinct fractional delays and phase shifts. In order to reduce both the design and the implementation complexity of the synthesis FB, the synthesis filters are implemented using a cosine-modulated FB. In addition to the reduced complexity of the reconstructor, the proposed multi-channel recovery scheme also supports online reconfigurability which is required in flexible (multi-mode) systems where the user subband locations vary with time.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2451104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2451104","startPage":"5238","endPage":"5249","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07140828.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Recovery of Sub-Nyquist Sampled Sparse Multi-Band Signals Using Reconfigurable Multi-Channel Analysis and Modulated Synthesis Filter Banks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Recovery of Sub-Nyquist Sampled Sparse Multi-Band Signals Using Reconfigurable Multi-Channel Analysis and Modulated Synthesis Filter Banks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","volume":"63","issue":"19","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140828/","accessionNumber":"15430445","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140828/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Recovery of Sub-Nyquist Sampled Sparse Multi-Band Signals Using Reconfigurable Multi-Channel Analysis and Modulated Synthesis Filter Banks","sourcePdf":"tsp-pillai-2451104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082089S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7140828","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7140830,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Segarra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7243391/7140830/7140830-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Santiago Segarra (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering with highest honors from the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Buenos Aires (ITBA), Argentina, in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Philadelphia, USA, in 2014.","Since 2011, he has been working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, UPenn.

WANs of different authors can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov chain and are therefore compared in terms of their relative entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and attribution accuracy is benchmarked across a diverse pool of authors and varying text lengths. This analysis shows that, since function words are independent of content, their use tends to be specific to an author and that the relational data captured by function WANs is a good summary of stylometric fingerprints. Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by methods that rely on word frequencies alone. Further combining WANs with methods that rely on word frequencies, results in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources of information encode different aspects of authorial styles.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2451111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7243391/07140830.pdf","startPage":"5464","endPage":"5478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2451111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Authorship Attribution Through Function Word Adjacency Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140830/","displayDocTitle":"Authorship Attribution Through Function Word Adjacency Networks","volume":"63","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15432971","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140830/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authorship Attribution Through Function Word Adjacency Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-segarra-2451111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142857S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7243391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7243391","articleId":"7140830","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140831,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yiming","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Devices and Techniques, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7217861/7140831/7140831-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Yiming (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received his B.Sc degree in physics from Peking University, China, in 2001.

The distortion is constituted by numerous noise-like inter-modulation products (IMPs). Although the overall behavior of nonlinear IMP distortion has been well studied, in large multi-carrier contexts, such as in OFDM, the knowledge of individual IMPs and their quantitative interrelationships, together with the derivation of behavioural knowledge and the predictability of consequences arising from such interrelationships, is a fairly unexplored topic. This is the subject of this paper. The powers of the very numerous individual IMPs generated are analytically derived based on a Bessel-Fourier PA behavioural model, and it is proven that these powers have only a small number of distinct powers. Proven also is that the ratios of these power values are constants, and that these constants are invariant with the particular PA's nonlinearity characteristics or operating point. Further, it is proven that specific types of IMPs dominate nonlinear distortion effects. Finally, it is shown that IMP power spectra can be derived from a simple product of two polynomials, which are quadrature functions of frequency and PA operating point, respectively. Application possibilities for findings presented in this paper, such as their potential to contribute efficiency improvements in OFDM system modulation fidelity calculations (over 1100 times faster than conventional methods), are also outlined in the conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2451109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07140831.pdf","startPage":"5264","endPage":"5273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2451109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Decomposition Analysis of Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM Transmitter Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7140831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140831/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Decomposition Analysis of Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM Transmitter Systems","volume":"63","issue":"19","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15430446","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140831/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Decomposition Analysis of Nonlinear Distortion in OFDM Transmitter Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-lei-2451109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072851S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7140831","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7140832,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Prieto-Araujo","affiliation":["Departament d'Enginyeria El\u00e9ctrica, Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya.

In this system, both time and frequency offsets deteriorate the orthogonality of sub-carriers and generate multi-user interference which degrades the system performance. For fast and efficient design of such systems, it is crucial to have an analytical and accurate evaluation of the system performance. However, such closed-form expression for the error rate is available only for perfectly synchronized SC-FDMA systems in the literature. In fact, the performance of SC-FDMA systems in the presence of time or frequency offsets has only been evaluated based on simulations. In this paper, we analytically obtain the symbol error rate (SER) of an SC-FDMA system impaired by time or frequency offsets when data is transmitted over a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. Through comparative simulations, we show that our proposed analysis can accurately evaluate the SER performance of SC-FDMA systems in the presence of time and frequency uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2450743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2450743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07140835.pdf","startPage":"6230","endPage":"6239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of SC-FDMA Systems in the Presence of Frequency and Time Offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7140835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of SC-FDMA Systems in the Presence of Frequency and Time Offset","volume":"14","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583860","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7140835/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of SC-FDMA Systems in the Presence of Frequency and Time Offset","sourcePdf":"twc-sabbaghian-2450743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06914S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7321101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7321101","articleId":"7140835","onlineDate":"30 June 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7140839,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Pourghorban Saghati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7177154/7140839/7140839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Pourghorban Saghati (S\u201908) received the M.Sc. degree (hons) in electrical engineering from Urmia University, Urmia, Iran, in 2010, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.","His research interests include reconfigurable multi-band and broadband antennas and filters, miniaturized antennas, antenna-in-package (AiP), and on-chip antennas (OCAs).","Mr. Pourghorban Saghati was the recipient of the Texas A&M University Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Departmental Graduate Student Scholarship in Fall 2011.

The passband frequency of the filter is changed based on employing the capacitive loading effect of a liquid metal placed on top of each CPW resonator using three parallel micro-channels. In addition, because of the loading effect of the metal bridges, miniaturization by a factor of 40% is achieved. The filter is digitally tuned from 3.4 to 5.5 GHz with an insertion loss of less than 5.0 dB and a relative bandwidth of 5 \u00b1 0.35%. The RF power-handling capability of the filter is characterized using a customized measurement setup. It is observed that the filter can be used for input RF powers of up to ~ 20 W for short-duration excitation conditions and 10 W for high-average-power excitation conditions.

This paper addresses the problem of mobile service selection for composition in terms of energy consumption. It formally models this problem and constructs energy consumption computation models. Energy consumption aggregation rules for composite services with different structures are presented. It adopts the genetic algorithm to resolve it. A replanning mechanism is also proposed to deal with the changeable conditions and user behavior. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our method.

Multi-hop CR network is an emerging area of interest for many researchers in recent years. The concept of multi-hop CR network is widely investigated with many wireless applications, such as video surveillance application. In this paper, we investigate a multi-hop CR network, which can serve as a video surveillance system. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence approach, is applied to select and switch to the best possible operating channel. In the CR network context, the unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) evade the licensed users' (or primary users', PUs') activities; while in the video surveillance system context, the honest users evade the malicious users' activities (or the denial of service attacks). In our investigation, the multi-hop network comprises of three SUs, namely source, relay and destination nodes. There is a single PU. The experimental setup consists of universal software radio peripheral (USRP) and GNU radio units. Our implementation results show that RL is an effective approach that enables SUs (or honest users) to evade PUs' (or malicious users') activities, and so it improves network performance.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2014.1402","pdfPath":"/iel7/7114925/7114926/07141228.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Frontiers of Communications, Networks and Applications (ICFCNA 2014 - Malaysia)","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Frontiers of Communications, Networks and Applications (ICFCNA 2014 - Malaysia)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2014.1402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7114926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel selection in multi-hop cognitive radio network using reinforcement learning: An experimental study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7141228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Channel selection in multi-hop cognitive radio network using reinforcement learning: An experimental study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15125285","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel selection in multi-hop cognitive radio network using reinforcement learning: An experimental study","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur","sourcePdf":"20141402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033139S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2014","isNumber":"7114926","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7114925","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7141228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7143323,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Yu Lien","affiliation":["National Formosa University"],"bio":{"p":["Shao-yu Lien (sylien@nfu.edu.tw) is an assistant professor at the Department of Electronic Engineering, National For-mosa University, Taiwan.

To build and operate such systems, mobile operators have given significant attention to cloud radio access networks, C-RANs, due to their beneficial features of performance optimization and cost effectiveness. Along with the architectural enhancement of C-RAN, largescale antennas (a.k.a. massive MIMO) at cell sites contribute greatly to increased network capacity either with higher spectral efficiency or through permitting many users at once. In this article, we discuss the challenging issues of CRAN- based HetNets (H-CRAN), especially with respect to large-scale antenna operation. We provide an overview of existing C-RAN architectures in terms of large-scale antenna operation and promote a partially centralized approach. This approach remarkably reduces fronthaul overheads in C-RANs with large-scale antennas. We also provide some insights into its potential and applicability in the fronthaul bandwidth-limited H-CRAN with large-scale antennas.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143324.pdf","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale antenna operation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: a partial centralization approach","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7143324","startPage":"32","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7143324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale antenna operation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: a partial centralization approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143324/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15274254","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143324/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale antenna operation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: a partial centralization approach","sourcePdf":"010CHAE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050251S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143324","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7143325,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Ran","affiliation":["Nanjing University"],"bio":{"p":["Shaowei Wang (wangsw@nju.edu.cn) is a professor at Nan-jing University.

The key idea of the H-CRAN is incorporating cloud computing into a heterogeneous network (HetNet) to enhance coordinated multipoint transmission and reception, cooperative radio resource management, and self-organizing networks, which improve both spectral and energy efficiencies of cellular systems. One of the most critical challenges that hinder the implementation of the H-CRAN is the high transmission demand on the backhauls between the baseband unit (BBU) pool and remote radio heads (RRHs). In this article we suggest that we can balance the workload of different RRHs to alleviate the pressure on the transmission links. Our proposed method is different from but compatible with existing compression techniques that have been widely investigated in the literature to lighten the transmission burden of the backhauls. We also describe the technical challenges in existence during the implementation of our proposal and give preliminary ideas of how to address them.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7143325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143325.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing backhaul load in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7143325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143325/","displayDocTitle":"Balancing backhaul load in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15274255","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7143325/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing backhaul load in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks","sourcePdf":"011WANG1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057455S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143325","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7143326,"authors":[{"name":"Minho Jo","affiliation":["Korea University"],"bio":{"p":["MinhoJo [M'07] (minhojo@korea.ac.kr) is a professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science, Korea University, Sejong Metropolitan City.

This article proposes a hierarchical cloud computing architecture to enhance performance by adding a mobile dynamic cloud formed by powerful mobile devices to a traditional general static cloud. A mobile dynamic cloud is based on heterogeneous wireless architecture where device-to-device communication is used for data transmission between user devices. The main advantage of the proposed architecture is an increase in overall capacity of a mobile network through improved channel utilization and traffic offloading from Long Term Evolution-Advanced to device-to-device communication links. Simulations show that the proposed architecture increases the capacity of a mobile network by up to 10 percent depending on the conditions and amount of offloaded data. The offloading probability is also evaluated by taking into consideration the number of devices in the cloudlet and the content matching values. We have gained insight into how content similarity affects offloading probability much more than the number of devices in a cloudlet.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7143326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143326","startPage":"50","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143326.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-to-device-based heterogeneous radio access network architecture for mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Device-to-device-based heterogeneous radio access network architecture for mobile cloud computing","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15274256","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143326/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-to-device-based heterogeneous radio access network architecture for mobile cloud computing","sourcePdf":"012JO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042526S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143326","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7143328,"authors":[{"name":"Hayssam Dahrouj","affiliation":["Effat University"],"bio":{"p":["Hayssam Dahrouj [s'02, M'11, SM'15] (hayssam.dahrouj@gmail.com) received his B.E. degree (with high distinction) in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, in 2005, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto (UofT), Canada, in 2010.

Such densification is progressively diffusing the move from traditional macrocell base stations toward heterogeneous networks with diverse cell sizes (e.g., microcell, picocell, femotcell) and diverse radio access technologies (e.g., GSM, CDMA), and LTE). The coexistence of the different network entities brings an additional set of challenges, particularly in terms of the provisioning of high-speed communications and the management of wireless interference. Resource sharing between different entities, largely incompatible in conventional systems due to the lack of interconnections, becomes a necessity. By connecting all the base stations from different tiers to a central processor (referred to as the cloud) through wire/wireline backhaul links, the heterogeneous cloud radio access network, H-CRAN, provides an open, simple, controllable, and flexible paradigm for resource allocation. This article discusses challenges and recent developments in H-CRAN design. It proposes promising resource allocation schemes in H-CRAN: coordinated scheduling, hybrid backhauling, and multicloud association. Simulations results show how the proposed strategies provide appreciable performance improvement compared to methods from recent literature.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143328.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: advances and challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143328/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: advances and challenges","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15274258","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: advances and challenges","sourcePdf":"014DAHROUJ_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058557S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143328","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7143329,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Antonio Marotta","affiliation":["The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"],"bio":{"p":["Marcelo A.

In this article we will provide an algorithmic approach to the new design challenges for the dense heterogeneous Cloud-RAN based on convex optimization. As problem sizes scale up with the network size, we will demonstrate that it is critical to take unique structures of design problems and inherent characteristics of wireless channels into consideration, while convex optimization will serve as a powerful tool for such purposes. Network power minimization and channel state information acquisition will be used as two typical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of convex optimization methods. Then we will present a twostage framework to solve general large-scale convex optimization problems, which is amenable to parallel implementation in the cloud data center.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"22","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15274267","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143330/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale convex optimization for ultra-dense cloud-RAN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale convex optimization for ultra-dense cloud-RAN","sourcePdf":"016SHI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088106S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143330","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7143331,"authors":[{"name":"Haijun Zhang","affiliation":["University of British, Vancouver"],"bio":{"p":["Haijun Zhang [m\u201813] (haijunzhang@ece.ubc.ca) received his Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts Telecommunications (BUPT).

The heterogeneous cloud small cell network (HCSNet), which combines cloud computing and a heterogeneous small cell network, will likely play an important role in 5G mobile communication networks. However, with massive deployment of small cells, co-channel interference and handover management are two important problems in an HCSNet, especially for cell edge users. In this article, we examine the problems of cooperative interference mitigation and handover management in an HCSNet. A network architecture is described to combine cloud radio access network with small cells. An effective CoMP clustering scheme using affinity propagation is adopted to mitigate cell edge users' interference. A low-complexity handover management scheme is presented, and its signaling procedure is analyzed in an HCSNet. Numerical results show that with the proposed network architecture, CoMP clustering and handover management schemes can significantly increase the capacity of HCSNet while maintaining users' quality of service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","volume":"22","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15274262","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143331/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative interference mitigation and handover management for heterogeneous cloud small cell networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative interference mitigation and handover management for heterogeneous cloud small cell networks","sourcePdf":"017JIANG1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047398S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143331","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7143332,"authors":[{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University"],"bio":{"p":["Gongpu Wang (gpwang@bjtu.edu.cn) received his B.

Specifically, we recognize seven challenges in channel estimation that are caused by a large number of channel parameters, heterogeneity of access nodes in H-CRANs, and the time delays among different nodes. Several research directions for handling these challenges are also proposed, for example, array signal processing and channel compression can eliminate the number of channel estimates, while channel prediction and modification for high-speed railway communications and adaptive downlink array from uplink measurements excel in overcoming the non-reciprocity in channel parameters.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7143332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143332","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143332.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of channel state information in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: challenges and research directions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of channel state information in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: challenges and research directions","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15274261","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7143332/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of channel state information in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: challenges and research directions","sourcePdf":"018WANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063313S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143332","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7143335,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cao","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Yang Cao (ycao@hust.edu.cn) is currently an assistant professor in the School of Electronics Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.

Further, when the cooperation between cellular users and D2D users is enabled, a win-win situation can be achieved to make all users better off. Thus motivated, we propose a cooperative D2D communication framework in this article, which introduces the cooperative relay technique to conventional underlay/overlay D2D communications.

We further identify three key challenges in bringing LTE-U into reality together with related research directions. In particular, the most critical issue of LTE-U is coexistence with other unlicensed systems, such as widely deployed WiFi. The LTE/WiFi coexistence mechanisms are elaborated in time, frequency, and power aspects, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that LTE-U can provide better user experience to LTE users while well protecting the incumbent WiFi users' performance compared to two existing advanced technologies: cellular/WiFi interworking and licensed-only heterogeneous networks (Het-Nets).","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7143339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7143314/07143339.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7143314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7143339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE-unlicensed: the future of spectrum aggregation for cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7143339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"LTE-unlicensed: the future of spectrum aggregation for cellular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7143339/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15274263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7143339/","volume":"22","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE-unlicensed: the future of spectrum aggregation for cellular networks","sourcePdf":"025ZHANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06647S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7143314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"280","xplore-issue":"7143314","articleId":"7143339","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145036,"authors":[{"name":"L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bak\u00f3","affiliation":["Research Department, \u201cPetru Maior\u201d University of T\u00eergu-Mure\u0219, T\u00eergu-Mure\u0219, Romania"],"firstName":"L\u00e1szl\u00f3","lastName":"Bak\u00f3","id":"37698393800"},{"name":"C\u0103lin En\u0103chescu","affiliation":["Research Department, \u201cPetru Maior\u201d University of T\u00eergu-Mure\u0219, T\u00eergu-Mure\u0219, Romania"],"firstName":"C\u0103lin","lastName":"En\u0103chescu","id":"38548663800"},{"name":"S\u00e1ndor-Tiham\u00e9r Brassai","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania, T\u00eergu-Mure\u0219, Romania"],"firstName":"S\u00e1ndor-Tiham\u00e9r","lastName":"Brassai","id":"37697899100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7370-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7369-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7145036","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","image sequences","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low resource-cost video data processing method","optical flow extraction","egomotion estimation","obstacle avoidance","motion detection task","hardware-software codesign techniques","low-power video data processing algorithm","standard video sequence inputs","embedded FPGA-based platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical flow","real-time","embedded","video sequence","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"The main goal of the proposed project is to build real-time hardware implementations of Optical Flow methods for tasks like egomotion estimation and/or obstacle avoidance.

The new methodology consists in the identification of a set of standardized parameters, obtained by a data set of angular velocities of healthy subjects age-matched. Sagittal angular velocities of lower limbs of ten typically developed children (TD) and ten children with hemiplegia (HC) were acquired by means of the tri-axial gyroscope embedded into Magnetic Inertial Measurement Units (MIMU). The actual sequence of gait phases was captured through a set of four foot switches. The experimental protocol consists in two walking tasks on a treadmill set at 1.0 and 1.5 km/h. We used the Goodness (G) as parameter, computed from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space, to compare the results obtained by the new methodology with the ones obtained by the subject-specific training of HMM via the Baum-Welch Algorithm. Paired-sample t-tests have shown no significant statistically differences between the two procedures when the gait phase detection was performed with the gyroscopes placed on the foot. Conversely, significant differences were found in data gathered by means of gyroscopes placed on shank. Actually, data relative to both groups presented G values in the range of good/optimum classifier (i.e. G \u2264 0.3), with better performance for the two-phase classifier model. In conclusion, the novel methodology here proposed guarantees the possibility to omit the off-line subject-specific training procedure for gait phase detection and it can be easily implemented in the control algorithm of active orthoses.","doi":"10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145188","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128112/7145157/07145188.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time gait detection based on Hidden Markov Model: Is it possible to avoid training procedure?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145188/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time gait detection based on Hidden Markov Model: Is it possible to avoid training procedure?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145188/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time gait detection based on Hidden Markov Model: Is it possible to avoid training procedure?","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570082153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056802S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128112","isNumber":"7145157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128112","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7145157","articleId":"7145188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":7145207,"authors":[{"name":"Guglielmo Frigo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova"],"firstName":"Guglielmo","lastName":"Frigo","id":"37567990200"},{"name":"Sabrina Brigadoi","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College, London"],"firstName":"Sabrina","lastName":"Brigadoi","id":"38228347600"},{"name":"Giada Giorgi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova"],"firstName":"Giada","lastName":"Giorgi","id":"37297101500"},{"name":"Giovanni Sparacino","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Sparacino","id":"37297394800"},{"name":"Claudio Narduzzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Narduzzi","id":"37274890100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6477-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7145207","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"In the biomedical scenario, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is employed as a non-invasive brain imaging technique. In particular, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the brain response, also known as haemodynamic response (HR), to pre-defined stimuli. Processing of fNIRS data requires a great effort to extrapolate the informative component from a noisy mixture of physiological and spurious contributions. In this paper a novel fNIRS de-noising algorithm is presented and validated over both synthetic ideal and synthetic realistic data. The short-separation channel signal is divided into nonoverlapping short sequences. For each of them, a specific noise model is identified and subtracted from the corresponding standard channel data. The algorithm relies on a combination of a super-resolution technique based on Compressive Sensing theory and spectral analysis performed via Taylor-Fourier transform. Preliminary experimental results show a significant reduction of spurious components in all the considered conditions. No significant distortions are introduced in the recovered HR, ensuring reliable clinical interpretation of the acquired trace.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical

The purpose of this study was to cross-validate the beat-by-beat time variations in seismocardiography (SCG) with electrocardiography (ECG) for determining ultra-short term HRV indices. Twenty healthy young volunteers were examined in this study by performing an ultra-short term data acquisition protocol. Kubios HRV software was utilized to assess the HRV parameters. The HRV indices were analyzed in both time-domain and frequency-domain processes. High linear relationship (r>0.98) and agreement was observed between the HRV indexes calculated from SCG and ECG data. In conclusion, SCG and ECG HRV indices were found to be statistically close enough to warrant the use of SCG for estimating HRV.","doi":"10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145210","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128112/7145157/07145210.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seismocardiography: Toward heart rate variability (HRV) estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145210/","displayDocTitle":"Seismocardiography: Toward heart rate variability (HRV) estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278169","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145210/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seismocardiography: Toward heart rate variability (HRV) estimation","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570084259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055453S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128112","isNumber":"7145157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128112","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7145157","articleId":"7145210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145223,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085462977"},{"name":"Xiaogang Sun","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085454996"},{"name":"Xingsong Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xingsong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375900"},{"name":"Qingcong Wu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qingcong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085438964"},{"name":"Bin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Orthopedics Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085461968"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6477-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7145223","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Surgery","Robots","Force measurement","Sensors","Shafts","Bones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical measurement","bone","force measurement","force sensors","fracture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intraoperative noninvasive force measuring system","femoral fracture reduction","minimally invasive surgery","skeletal traction","intraoperative counteracting soft tissue forces","force sensors","leg","intramedullary nail"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fracture reduction","skeletal traction force","skeletal alignment force","measurement system","robotic"]}],"abstract":"Fracture reduction is a critical step in minimally invasive surgery of displaced femoral fracture treatment. Skeletal traction and alignment for fracture reduction can be performed individually in the operation, which is a standard procedure for the surgeons in practice. The intraoperative counteracting soft tissue forces during the fracture reduction should be measured precisely for improvement of the operation. In this paper, a set of measurement system was developed to obtain the value of the forces. Forces of skeletal traction and alignment were measured by three individual sensors, and the corresponding results can be recorded instantaneously during the fracture reduction process. According to an experimental test, the maximum alignment force in X-axis and Y-axis direction were 48.4N and 240.1N, respectively. The maximum traction force was 379.7N, occurred because of the slight valgus positioning of the leg to be convenient to insert the intramedullary nail. The highest forces were mostly observed along the shaft axis for skeletal traction. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed measurement system, and indicate the potential application in developing new instruments for the fracture reduction operation.","doi":"10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145223","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128112/7145157/07145223.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of intraoperative noninvasive force measuring system during femoral fracture reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145223/","displayDocTitle":"Development of intraoperative noninvasive force measuring system during femoral fracture reduction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278145","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145223/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of intraoperative noninvasive force measuring system during femoral fracture reduction","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"1570072167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070948S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128112","isNumber":"7145157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128112","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145157","articleId":"7145223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145272,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos E.

We tackle the cloudlet network design problem for mobile access networks. The model is such that virtual machines are associated with mobile users and are allocated to cloudlets. Designing a cloudlet network implies first determining where to install cloudlet facilities among the available sites, then assigning sets of access points such as base-stations to cloudlets, while supporting virtual machine migrations and taking into account partial user mobility information, as well as the satisfaction of service-level agreements. We present link-path formulations supported by heuristics to compute solutions in reasonable time. We qualify the advantage in considering mobility for both users and virtual machines as up to 40% less cloudlet facilities to install and 40% less virtual machine migrations to execute. We compare two migration modes, bulk and live migration, as a function of mobile cloud service requirements, determining that a high preference should be given to bulk migrations for delay-stringent services such as augmented reality support, while for applications with less stringent delay requirements, live migration appears as largely preferable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128766/7145285/07145315.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","doi":"10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloudlet network design optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Mobile communication","Mathematical model","Mobile computing","Synchronization","Computational modeling","Virtual machining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","cloud computing","mobile computing","optimisation","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloudlet network design optimization","virtualization server cluster","mobile cloud service","virtual machine migration","user mobility information","link-path formulation","augmented reality support"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cloudlet network design optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145315/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15276794","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloudlet network design optimization","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070066S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128766","isNumber":"7145285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128766","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7145285","articleId":"7145315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145316,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqiang Wang","affiliation":["Imperial College London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shiqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538880400"},{"name":"Rahul Urgaonkar","affiliation":["IBM, T.

This offers the benefits of reduction in network overhead and latency but requires service migrations as user locations change over time. It is challenging to make these decisions in an optimal manner because of the uncertainty in node mobility as well as possible non-linearity of the migration and transmission costs. In this paper, we formulate a sequential decision making problem for service migration using the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our formulation captures general cost models and provides a mathematical framework to design optimal service migration policies. In order to overcome the complexity associated with computing the optimal policy, we approximate the underlying state space by the distance between the user and service locations. We show that the resulting MDP is exact for uniform one-dimensional mobility while it provides a close approximation for uniform two-dimensional mobility with a constant additive error term. We also propose a new algorithm and a numerical technique for computing the optimal solution which is significantly faster in computation than traditional methods based on value or policy iteration. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by simulation using real-world mobility traces of taxis in San Francisco.","doi":"10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145316","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128766/7145285/07145316.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic service migration in mobile edge-clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145316/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic service migration in mobile edge-clouds","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15276791","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145316/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic service migration in mobile edge-clouds","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087625S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128766","isNumber":"7145285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128766","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"7145285","articleId":"7145316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145322,"authors":[{"name":"Bryan Ng","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Bryan","lastName":"Ng","id":"37085544371"},{"name":"Matthew Hayes","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37085573084"},{"name":"Winston K.G.

This paper reports on the practical experiences and lessons learned while developing an SDN based traffic classification platform for an enterprise network. We use the platform to demonstrate the feasibility of SDN based traffic classifiers by evaluating against a set of desired outcomes.

We analyze reachability disruptions, caused by failures of RNP's interdomain links, that block all international traffic. We also analyze performance disruptions, caused by simultaneous failure of multiple RNP intradomain links, which result in congestion and performance degradation. We study the impact of disruptions on traffic, application mix, and user behavior. Our results show that users adapt their behavior when some applications become unavailable and when network performance degrades. For example, users tend to migrate to Youtube when Facebook becomes unavailable during reachability disruptions; similarly, users migrate to Facebook when congestion during performance disruptions severely degrade Youtube experience. We also correlate the impact of disruptions to network topology and show that performance during a performance disruption depends on the location and importance of failed links.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145327","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128766/7145285/07145327.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of provider failures on the traffic at a university campus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of provider failures on the traffic at a university campus","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145327/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15276795","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145327/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of provider failures on the traffic at a university campus","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099912S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128766","isNumber":"7145285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128766","xplore-issue":"7145285","articleId":"7145327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145337,"authors":[{"name":"Di Li","affiliation":["Communication and Distributed Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"lastName":"Di Li","id":"37713386500"},{"name":"Zhichao Lin","affiliation":["Communication and Distributed Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"lastName":"Zhichao Lin","id":"37085535948"},{"name":"Mirko Stoffers","affiliation":["Communication and Distributed Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Stoffers","id":"38482977600"},{"name":"James Gross","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Gross","id":"37298444700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9018-8268-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7145337","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Cognitive radio","Frequency measurement","Euclidean distance","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum aware virtual coordinates assignment","multihop cognitive radio network","geographic routing","geographic distance","opportunistic spectrum availability","licensed users","path construction","channel utility","primary user sojourning time"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum aware virtual coordinates assignment and routing in multihop cognitive radio network","doi":"10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145285","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128766/7145285/07145337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145337","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145337","abstract":"We propose Spectrum Aware Virtual Coordinate (SAViC) for multi hop cognitive radio network (CRN) to facilitate geographic routing. The proposed virtual coordinates (VC) of any two secondary users reflect both geographic distance and opportunistic spectrum availability between them. As a result, geographic routing is able to detour the area affected by licensed users or cut through the area with more available spectrum. According to different spectrum occupation patterns of primary user, two versions of SAViC are designed based on the channel utility and primary user's sojourning time respectively. Simulation shows the proposed virtual coordinate facilitates geographic routing to achieve high success rate of path construction. When duty cycle on the licensed channel is heterogeneous in the network, channel utility based virtual coordinate supports geographic routing to outperform a state-of-the-art geographic routing protocol by 40% on packet delivery ratio. When the channel utility is identical on each secondary node, and the sojourning time of primary users for secondary users are different from each other, SAViC based on primary user's sojourning time achieves significantly shorter delay than other virtual coordinates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15276827","htmlLink":"/document/7145337/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum aware virtual coordinates assignment and routing in multihop cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum aware virtual coordinates assignment and routing in multihop cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086955S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128766","isNumber":"7145285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128766","xplore-issue":"7145285","articleId":"7145337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145338,"authors":[{"name":"Jocelyne Elias","affiliation":["LIPADE, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"],"firstName":"Jocelyne","lastName":"Elias","id":"37396783300"},{"name":"Marwan Krunz","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Arizona"],"firstName":"Marwan","lastName":"Krunz","id":"37280483100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9018-8268-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7145338","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Games","Interference","Databases","Linear programming","White spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network management","television broadcasting","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed spectrum management","TV white space cognitive radio networks","TVWS cognitive radio networks","game theoretical approach","adjacent channel interference","TV bands devices","TVBD","TV channels","idle blocks","objective function","database operator","cost function","interference","unlicensed devices","TVWS management game","best response algorithm","Nash equilibrium","NE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TV White Space","Database","TV bands devices","Guard bands","Spectrum management","Game theory","Nash equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145338","doi":"10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145338","publicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the spectrum management problem in TV White Space (TVWS) Cognitive Radio Networks using a game theoretical approach, accounting for adjacent-channel interference. TV Bands Devices (TVBDs) compete to access available TV channels and choose idle blocks that optimize some objective function. Specifically, the goal of each TVBD is to minimize the price paid to the Database operator and a cost function that depends on the interference between unlicensed devices. We show that the proposed TVWS management game admits a potential function under general conditions. Accordingly, we use a Best Response algorithm to converge in few iterations to the Nash Equilibrium (NE) points. We evaluate the performance of the proposed game, considering both static and dynamic TVWS scenarios and taking into account users' mobility. Our results show that at the NE, the game provides an interesting tradeoff between efficient TV spectrum use and reduction of interference between TVBDs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145285","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128766/7145285/07145338.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed spectrum management in TV White Space Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145338/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed spectrum management in TV White Space Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15276828","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed spectrum management in TV White Space Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"Paper48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05752S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128766","isNumber":"7145285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128766","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145285","articleId":"7145338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145378,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodi You","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodi","lastName":"You","id":"37085340640"},{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311011300"},{"name":"Huanhuan Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Huanhuan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085463365"},{"name":"Changyuan Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyuan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085364904"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7145378","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"System schematic combining MPPM pattern effect and OFDM signal.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"35KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7128802/7145378/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2451619.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7128802/7145378/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2451619.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145378","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Pulse width modulation","Receivers","Sensitivity","Light emitting diodes","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient data transmission","MPPM dimming control","indoor visible light communication","receiver sensitivity requirement","multipulse position modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals","quadrature amplitude modulation symbol rate","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimming control","visible light communication (VLC)","multi-pulse position modulation (MPPM)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","receiver sensitivity requirement"]},{"kwd":["Dimming control","visible light communication (VLC)","multi-pulse position modulation (MPPM)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","receiver sensitivity requirement"]}],"abstract":"In conventional visible light communication (VLC) dimming control systems utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM), reducing the duty cycle will push up the receiver sensitivity requirement if the transmission rate is kept constant.

Noise, frequency shifts, and echoes disturb the signal and induce measurement errors of the time stamp, which leads to localization errors. Furthermore, the line of sight (LOS) signal has to be distinguished from the echoes to avoid false signal tracking. The proposed method combines the information of an ultrasound transmission with the measured time stamp and estimates the identifier. In our approach, the ultrasound transmission system uses phase-shift keying to modulate the signal. The received symbols and the time stamps are tracked and fused by the Kalman filter to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the fused symbols and improve the validity of the decoding. Hence, the bias of the received symbols is tracked and the tracking allows to distinguish between the LOS signal and the echoes. As a result, the data fusion reduces the packet error rate from 70% at a distance of 21 m to 4.5%. Moreover, the median error of the localization is reduced from 7 to 4.6 cm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145380/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15378975","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Fusion of Time Stamps and Transmitted Data for Unsynchronized Beacons","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung through the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research","grantNumber":"16SV5988"},{"fundingName":"Spitzencluster MicroTec Suedwest"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Fusion of Time Stamps and Transmitted Data for Unsynchronized Beacons","sourcePdf":"jsen-traubens-2452227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065455S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7181761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7181761","articleId":"7145380","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":7145389,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Lei","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical, and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7333020/7145389/lei-small.gif","p":["Gang Lei (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from\n Huanggang Normal University, Huanggang, China, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006 and 2009,\n respectively.","He is currently a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the University of Technology, Sydney, NSW,\n Australia.

For framework design of the multilevel optimization method, four techniques are presented in this paper, including the sizing equation, local sensitivity analysis, global sensitivity analysis, and design of experiments techniques. For each technique, a general and theoretical analysis procedure is presented before the application study. To demonstrate the effectiveness, a permanent magnet claw-pole motor with soft magnetic composite core and 3-D finite-element analysis model is investigated to minimize the material cost and maximize the output power while keeping the volume constant. The calculated motor performance based on this 3-D finite-element model has been verified by the experimental results. As shown, these techniques are simple to implement, and the resultant multilevel optimization framework can significantly improve the motor performance and reduce the required sample number of finite-element analysis.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145389","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Sensitivity","Design optimization","Power generation","Finite element analysis","Analysis of variance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite materials","finite element analysis","magnetic cores","motor drives","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","sensitivity analysis","soft magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel design optimization","electrical machines","drive systems","multilevel optimization method","sizing equation","local sensitivity analysis","global sensitivity analysis","permanent magnet claw-pole motor","soft magnetic composite core","3D finite element analysis model","material cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical models","design of experiments (DOE)","optimization methods","permanent magnet (PM) motors","sensitivity analysis"]},{"kwd":["Analytical models","design of experiments (DOE)","optimization methods","permanent magnet (PM) motors","sensitivity analysis"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7333020/07145389.pdf","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7333020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2015.2444434","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2015.2444434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for Multilevel Design Optimization of Permanent Magnet Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145389/","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for Multilevel Design Optimization of Permanent Magnet Motors","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602852","htmlLink":"/document/7145389/","volume":"30","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for Multilevel Design Optimization of Permanent Magnet Motors","sourcePdf":"tec-lei-2444434-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120598S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7333020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"7333020","articleId":"7145389","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7145391,"authors":[{"name":"Jitendra K.

A pilot contamination attack occurs when during the training phase, an adversary also sends identical training (pilot) signal as that of the legitimate receiver. This contaminates the channel estimation phase and can alter the legitimate beamformer/precoder design, facilitating eavesdropping. In this letter, we propose superimposing a random sequence on the training sequence at the legitimate receiver, allowing use of source enumeration methods to detect pilot contamination attack. The proposed method is analyzed and its detection performance is illustrated via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2451638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2451638","startPage":"525","endPage":"528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7295645/07145391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7295645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Contamination for Detection of Pilot Contamination Attack in Multiple Antenna Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Self-Contamination for Detection of Pilot Contamination Attack in Multiple Antenna Systems","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15520430","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145391/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Contamination for Detection of Pilot Contamination Attack in Multiple Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-tugnait-2451638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093295S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7295645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7295645","articleId":"7145391","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145399,"authors":[{"name":"Humberto Bustince","affiliation":["Departamento de Autom\u00e1tica y Computaci\u00f3n, Universidad P\u00fablica de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7396984/7145399/busti-small.gif","p":["Humberto Bustince (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) received the Ph.D.\n degree in mathematics from the Public University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, in 1994.","He is currently a Full Professor with the Department of Automatics and Computation, Public University of Navarra.

In general, Luby transform (LT) codes exhibit a high erasure floor due to poor minimum-distance properties, which can be improved by maximizing the minimum variable-node degree. The same behavior is observed for DLT codes, and therefore a new combining scheme at the relay is proposed to maximize the minimum variable-node degree in the decoding graph. Furthermore, the encoding process at the sources and the combining scheme at the relay are coordinated to improve the transmission overhead. To characterize the asymptotic performance of the proposed DLT codes, we derive closed-form density-evolution expressions, considering both lossless and lossy source-relay channels, respectively. To support the asymptotic analysis, we evaluate the performance of the proposed DLT codes by numerical examples and demonstrate that the numerical results correspond closely to the analysis. Significant improvements in both the erasure floor and transmission overhead are obtained for the proposed DLT codes, as compared to conventional DLT codes.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"2788","endPage":"2796","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451640","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7182396/07145401.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erasure Floor Analysis of Distributed LT Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145401/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Erasure Floor Analysis of Distributed LT Codes","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15359429","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7145401/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"},{"fundingName":"EU Marie Curie Project, \u201cQUICK\u201d","grantNumber":"612652"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erasure Floor Analysis of Distributed LT Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hussain-2451640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058051S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7182396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7182396","articleId":"7145401","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7145404,"authors":[{"name":"Nihat Altiparmak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7447853/7145404/altip-2451620-small.gif","p":["Nihat Altiparmak (M\u201910) received the BS degree in computer\n engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey in 2007, and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the\n University of Texas at San Antonio in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Recently, maximum flow based optimal replica selection algorithms were proposed guaranteeing the minimum retrieval time in heterogeneous environments. Although optimality of the retrieval schedule is an important property, execution time of the replica selection algorithm is also crucial since it might significantly affect the performance of the storage sub-system. Current replica selection mechanisms achieve the optimal response time retrieval schedule by performing multiple runs of a maximum flow algorithm in a black-box manner. Such black-box usage of a maximum flow algorithm results in unnecessary flow calculations since previously calculated flow values cannot be conserved. In addition, most new generation multi-disk storage architectures are powered with multi-core processors motivating the usage of multithreaded replica selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose multithreaded and integrated maximum flow based optimal replica selection algorithms handling heterogeneous storage architectures. Proposed and existing algorithms are evaluated using various homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-disk storage architectures. Experimental results show that proposed sequential integrated algorithm achieves 5X speed-up in homogeneous systems, and proposed multithreaded integrated algorithm achieves 21X speed-up using 16 threads in heterogeneous systems over the existing sequential black-box algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2451620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7447853/07145404.pdf","startPage":"1543","endPage":"1557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2451620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multithreaded Maximum Flow Based Optimal Replica Selection Algorithm for Heterogeneous Storage Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multithreaded Maximum Flow Based Optimal Replica Selection Algorithm for Heterogeneous Storage Architectures","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15917845","htmlLink":"/document/7145404/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multithreaded Maximum Flow Based Optimal Replica Selection Algorithm for Heterogeneous Storage Architectures","sourcePdf":"tc-altiparmak-2451620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13308S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7447853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7447853","articleId":"7145404","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145412,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

A WPCN leverages on a centralized base station (BS) that takes care of both wireless information and energy transfer. However, the harvested energy and, in turn, the spectral efficiency of uplink transmission of the users may significantly vary depending on the locations of the users and the channels used for energy and information transfer purposes. To this end, this paper theoretically characterizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage zones in a WPCN and comparatively analyzes the performance of three useful configurations of dedicated energy sources that can potentially minimize the SNR outage zones. These configurations are: (i) harvesting energy from and information transfer to a full-duplex BS. This is considered as a baseline configuration; (ii) harvesting energy from symmetrically deployed power beacons (PBs) and information transfer to a conventional half-duplex BS; and (iii) harvesting energy from symmetrically deployed PBs that are colocated with the distributed antenna elements (DAEs) of a conventional half-duplex BS. For all the listed cases, we characterize the SNR outage probability and spectral efficiency of an arbitrarily located user within the cellular region. Based on the derived expressions, we also optimize the distance of the PBs from the BS to minimize the SNR outage probability and provide closed-form solutions for special cases. The optimum distance of the PBs is shown to be a function of the number of PBs and the coverage area of the BS. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived expressions, provide design insights related to WPCNs, and reveal the significance of the limited number of optimally placed PBs over a large number of randomly deployed PBs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Energy exchange","Uplink","Wireless communication","Antenna arrays","Fading","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radio equipment","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy sources deployment","wireless powered cellular networks","WPCN","reliability","battery lifetime","wireless devices","base station","BS","wireless information","energy transfer","harvested energy","uplink transmission","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR outage zones","energy sources","information transfer","baseline configuration","power beacons","PB","distributed antenna elements","DAE","SNR outage probability","cellular region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G cellular","wireless-powered cellular networks (WPCNs)","doubly near-far problem","scheduling","power beacons (PBs)","distributed antenna elements (DAEs)","uplink transmission","spectral efficiency","SNR outage probability"]},{"kwd":["5G cellular","wireless-powered cellular networks (WPCNs)","doubly near-far problem","scheduling","power beacons (PBs)","distributed antenna elements (DAEs)","uplink transmission","spectral efficiency","SNR outage probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7240139/07145426.pdf","startPage":"3391","endPage":"3404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Deployment of Energy Sources in Wireless-Powered Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Deployment of Energy Sources in Wireless-Powered Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145426/","volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145426/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15432793","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Collaborative Research and Development (CRD)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Deployment of Energy Sources in Wireless-Powered Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hossain-2451648-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093451S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7240139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7240139","articleId":"7145426","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7145430,"authors":[{"name":"SaiDhiraj Amuru","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7181762/7145430/amuru-2451081-small.gif","p":["SaiDhiraj Amuru (S\u201912) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Madras, Chennai, India, in 2009.

This paper considers the problem of optimal jamming over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We derive the optimal jamming signal for various digital amplitude-phase-modulated constellations and show that it is not always optimal to match the jammer's signal to the victim signal in order to maximize the error probability at the victim receiver. Connections between the optimum jammer obtained in this analysis and the well-known pulsed jammer, popularly analyzed in the context of spread spectrum communication systems, are illustrated. The gains obtained by the jammer when it knows the victim's modulation scheme and uses the optimal jamming signals obtained in this paper as opposed to conventional additive white Gaussian noise jamming are evaluated in terms of the additional signal power needed by the victim receiver to achieve the same error rates under these two jamming strategies. We then extend these findings to obtain the optimal jamming signal distribution: 1) when the victim uses an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated signal and 2) when there is multiple jammer attacking a single victim transmitter-receiver pair. Numerical results are presented in all the above cases to validate the theoretical inferences presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2451081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7181762/07145430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2451081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7181762","startPage":"2212","endPage":"2224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Jamming Against Digital Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Jamming Against Digital Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15397673","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145430/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Jamming Against Digital Modulation","sourcePdf":"tifs-amuru-2451081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09018S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7181762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7181762","articleId":"7145430","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7145457,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37402462800"},{"name":"Huang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085710165"},{"name":"Zhe Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085570696"},{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37401773900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2291"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2305"}],"articleNumber":"7145457","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3020},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Poles and towers","Planning","Entertainment industry","Man machine systems","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative filtering","recommender systems","social networking (online)","travel industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personalized travel package","multi-point-of-interest recommendation","crowdsourced user footprints","location-based social networks","LBSN","user preference","collaborative filtering approach","spatiotemporal constraints","heuristic search-based travel route planning algorithm","user travel demand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location-based social networks (LBSNs)","point-of-interest (POI) detection","travel package recommendation","travel route planning (TRP)"]},{"kwd":["Location-based social networks (LBSNs)","point-of-interest (POI) detection","travel package recommendation","travel route planning (TRP)"]}],"abstract":"Location-based social networks (LBSNs) provide people with an interface to share their locations and write reviews about interesting places of attraction. The shared locations form the crowdsourced digital footprints, in which each user has many connections to many locations, indicating user preference to locations.

The approach utilizes data collected from LBSNs to model users and locations, and it determines users' preferred destinations using collaborative filtering approaches. Recommendations are generated by jointly considering user preference and spatiotemporal constraints. A heuristic search-based travel route planning algorithm was designed to generate travel packages. We developed a prototype system, which obtains users' travel demands from mobile client and generates travel packages containing multiple points of interest and their visiting sequence. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach shows promise with respect to improving recommendation accuracy and diversity.","doi":"10.1109/THMS.2015.2446953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221037/7389462/07145457.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2015.2446953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7389462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalized Travel Package With Multi-Point-of-Interest Recommendation Based on Crowdsourced User Footprints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145457/","displayDocTitle":"Personalized Travel Package With Multi-Point-of-Interest Recommendation Based on Crowdsourced User Footprints","volume":"46","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15722302","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145457/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222209, 61373119 and 61332005"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20126102110043"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University","grantNumber":"CX201522"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized Travel Package With Multi-Point-of-Interest Recommendation Based on Crowdsourced User Footprints","sourcePdf":"thms-yu-2446953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221037","isNumber":"7389462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221037","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"7389462","articleId":"7145457","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7145465,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Zhang","affiliation":["Sense and Sense-abilities, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7293100/7145465/7145465-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengfei Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University in 2010 and 2015, under supervision of Prof. Xiao Gaoxi and Prof. Tan Hwee Pink, respectively.","He is now a Research Scientist with the Institute for Infocomm Research, under the Sense-Sense-abilities Programme.

Differently, this paper presents a sophisticated deep-learning technique for short-term and long-term wind speed forecast, i.e., the predictive deep Boltzmann machine (PDBM) and corresponding learning algorithm. The proposed deep model forecasts wind speed by analyzing the higher level features abstracted from lower level features of the wind speed data. These automatically learnt features are very informative and appropriate for the prediction. The proposed PDBM is a deep stochastic model that can represent the wind speed very well, and is inspired by two aspects. 1) The stochastic model is suitable to capture the probabilistic characteristics of wind speed. 2) Recent developments in neural networks with deep architectures show that deep generative models have competitive capability to approximate nonlinear and nonsmooth functions. The evaluation of the proposed PDBM model is depicted by both hour-ahead and day-ahead prediction experiments based on real wind speed datasets. The prediction accuracy of the PDBM model outperforms existing methods by more than 10%.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2434387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2434387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7270370/07145470.pdf","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Deep Boltzmann Machine for Multiperiod Wind Speed Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Deep Boltzmann Machine for Multiperiod Wind Speed Forecasting","volume":"6","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145470/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456830","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145470/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Macau Science and Technology development fund","grantNumber":"008/2010/A1"},{"fundingName":"UM Multiyear Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Deep Boltzmann Machine for Multiperiod Wind Speed Forecasting","sourcePdf":"tste-chen-2434387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151167S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7270370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"7270370","articleId":"7145470","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7145471,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Jamali","affiliation":["Chair for Digital Communication at the Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7321101/7145471/jamal-2451171-small.gif","p":["\n\nVahid Jamali (S'12) was born in Fasa, Iran, in 1988.

In this paper, we focus on decode-and-forward relays and assume that the links are impaired by block fading and additive white Gaussian noise. We design a new protocol which, unlike the conventional protocols for the multi-hop relay channel, does not adhere to a fixed and predefined pattern of using the transmit, receive, and silent states of the nodes. In particular, the proposed protocol selects the optimal states of the nodes and the corresponding optimal transmission rates based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved links in each fading block such that the achievable average rate from source to destination is maximized. To enable adaptive scheduling of the states of the nodes, the relay nodes have to be equipped with buffers for temporary storage of the information received from the preceding node. Additionally, we discuss and address two practical challenges arising in the implementation of the optimal protocol, namely the unconstrained end-to-end delay due to data buffering at the relays and the required CSI overhead. Numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed buffer-aided protocols compared to existing multi-hop relaying protocols.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Rate of the Half-Duplex Multi-Hop Buffer-Aided Relay Channel With Block Fading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2451171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07145471.pdf","startPage":"6240","endPage":"6256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2451171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rate of the Half-Duplex Multi-Hop Buffer-Aided Relay Channel With Block Fading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7145471/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583868","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Rate of the Half-Duplex Multi-Hop Buffer-Aided Relay Channel With Block Fading","sourcePdf":"twc-jamali-2451171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122535S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7321101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7321101","articleId":"7145471","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7145473,"authors":[{"name":"Hadeed Ahmed Sher","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7270370/7145473/hsher-2438781-small.gif","p":["\n               Hadeed Ahmed Sher (S14) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Bahauddin Zakaria University, Multan, Pakistan, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2008.

The proposed method improves the working of the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) method in changing environmental conditions by using the fractional short-circuit current (FSCC) method. It takes the initial operating point of a PV system by using the short-circuit current method and later shifts to the conventional P&O technique. The advantage of having this two-stage algorithm is rapid tracking under changing environmental conditions. In addition, this scheme offers low-power oscillations around MPP and, therefore, more power harvesting compared with the common P&O method. The proposed MPPT decides intelligently about the moment of measuring short-circuit current and is, therefore, an irradiance sensorless scheme. The proposed method is validated with computer software simulation followed by a dSPACE DS1104-based experimental setup. A buck-boost dc-dc converter is used for simulation and experimental confirmation. Furthermore, the reliability of the proposed method is also calculated. The results show that the proposed MPPT technique works satisfactorily under given environmental scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2438781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2438781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7270370/07145473.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Sensorless Hybrid MPPT Algorithm Based on Fractional Short-Circuit Current Measurement and P&O MPPT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New Sensorless Hybrid MPPT Algorithm Based on Fractional Short-Circuit Current Measurement and P&O MPPT","volume":"6","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145473/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456840","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145473/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004919","fundingName":"King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Sensorless Hybrid MPPT Algorithm Based on Fractional Short-Circuit Current Measurement and P&O MPPT","sourcePdf":"tste-sher-2438781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106648S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7270370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"7270370","articleId":"7145473","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7145476,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Stupia","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7273734/7145476/7145476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ivan Stupia (M\u201912) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","In 2011, he joined the Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM), University of Louvain.

This is achieved by modeling the transmit and receiver pairs as rational players that engage in a noncooperative game in which the utility function changes according to each player's nature. The underlying game is reformulated as a quasi variational inequality (QVI) problem using convex fractional program theory. The equivalence between the QVI and the noncooperative game provides us with all the mathematical tools to study the uniqueness of its Nash equilibrium points and to derive novel algorithms that allow the network to converge to these points in an iterative manner, both with and without the need for a centralized processing. Numerical results are used to validate the proposed solutions in different operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

The efficiency for amplification of a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) signal is improved by designing an asymmetric Doherty power amplifier (DPA). From the simulation result for a long-term evolution (LTE) signal with 7.2-dB PAPR, the DPA delivers the highest efficiency with 1:1.4 cell size ratio for the carrier and peaking PAs. A small size is achieved by designing the DPA using a GaN monolithic microwave integrated circuit process. For broadband operation, we employ a new circuit topology to alleviate the bandwidth limiting factors of the DPA such as a quarter-wavelength transformer, phase compensation network, and offset line. With the design concept, an asymmetric broadband DPA is implemented using a TriQuint 3MI 0.25-\u03bcm GaN-HEMT MMIC process. Across 2.1-2.7 GHz, the implemented PA deliver a drain efficiency of over 49%, a gain of over 12.6 dB, and adjacent channel leakage ratio of below -45 dBc at an average power of over 33.1 dBm for the LTE signal.

This work, to the authors' knowledge, represents the first online combinatorial auction designed for the cloud computing paradigm, which is general and expressive enough to both: 1) optimize system efficiency across the temporal domain instead of at an isolated time point; and 2) model dynamic provisioning of heterogeneous virtual machine (VM) types in practice. The final result is an online auction framework that is truthful, computationally efficient, and guarantees a competitive ratio \u2248 3.30 in social welfare in typical scenarios. The framework consists of three main steps: 1) a tailored primal-dual algorithm that decomposes the long-term optimization into a series of independent one-shot optimization problems, with a small additive loss in competitive ratio; 2) a randomized subframework that applies primal-dual optimization for translating a centralized cooperative social welfare approximation algorithm into an auction mechanism, retaining the competitive ratio while adding truthfulness; and 3) a primal-dual algorithm for approximating the one-shot optimization with a ratio close to e. We also propose two extensions: 1) a binary search algorithm that improves the average-case performance; 2) an improvement to the online auction framework when a minimum budget spending fraction is guaranteed, which produces a better competitive ratio. The efficacy of the online auction framework is validated through theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulation studies. We are also in the hope that the framework can be instructive in auction design for other related problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms","Optimization","Approximation methods","Cost accounting","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","combinatorial mathematics","electronic commerce","optimisation","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online auction framework","dynamic resource provisioning","cloud computing","online combinatorial auction","dynamic provisioning","heterogeneous virtual machine","primal-dual algorithm","randomized subframework","centralized cooperative social welfare approximation algorithm","binary search algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","combinatorial auction","resource allocation","pricing","online algorithms","truthful mechanisms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145493","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2444657","startPage":"2060","endPage":"2073","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07145493.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2444657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145493/","displayDocTitle":"An Online Auction Framework for Dynamic Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"24","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16231766","htmlLink":"/document/7145493/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Auction Framework for Dynamic Resource Provisioning in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tnet-shi-2444657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11305S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7145493","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7145494,"authors":[{"name":"Junjie Qin","affiliation":["Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7453237/7145494/7145494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junjie Qin (S'10) received the B.S. degrees in economics and hydropower engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Two fundamental sources of uncertainty are considered, namely the uncertainty in the unexpected fluctuation of the net demand process and the uncertainty in the locational marginal prices. We propose a very simple algorithm termed Online Modified Greedy (OMG) algorithm for this problem. A stylized analysis for the algorithm is performed, which shows that comparing to the optimal cost of the corresponding stochastic control problem, the sub-optimality of OMG is controlled by an easily computable bound. This suggests that, albeit simple, OMG is guaranteed to have good performance in cases when the bound is small. Meanwhile, OMG together with the sub-optimality bound can be used to provide a lower bound for the optimal cost. Such a lower bound can be valuable in evaluating other heuristic algorithms. For the latter cases, a semidefinite program is derived to minimize the sub-optimality bound of OMG. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the use of the algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2440355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453237","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7453237/07145494.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Modified Greedy Algorithm for Storage Control Under Uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145494/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Modified Greedy Algorithm for Storage Control Under Uncertainty","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935188","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Modified Greedy Algorithm for Storage Control Under Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-qin-2440355-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085767S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7453237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7453237","articleId":"7145494","onlineDate":"01 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145585,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitra Zarbouti","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Peloponnese, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitra","lastName":"Zarbouti","id":"37595696300"},{"name":"George Tsoulos","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Peloponnese, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Tsoulos","id":"37347366000"},{"name":"Georgia Athanasiadou","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Peloponnese, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Athanasiadou","id":"37264925000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145585","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Arrays","Interference cancellation","Antenna radiation patterns","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","multiplexing","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G multicell systems","in-band full duplex relays","in-band full-duplex operation","spectral efficiency","wireless communication systems","base-stations","in-band full duplex mode","SIR gain","antenna array beamforming","full duplex self-interference cancellation requirement","access link transmitted powers","Long Term Evolution","LTE nominal capacity"]}],"abstract":"In-band full-duplex operation has recently attracted a lot of attention as a possible solution for increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. This paper considers a 4G multicell system where base-stations and relays employ beamforming, while relays also operate in in-band full duplex mode. In the context of LTE, the excess SIR gain that is achieved with the help of typical or large scale antenna array beamforming can be used either for reducing the full duplex self-interference cancellation requirement, or for reducing the backhaul and access link transmitted powers. Results indicate that using 'small' antenna arrays with 16 elements can either lower the requirement of full duplex self-interference cancellation by almost 20dB, or lower both the backhaul and access transmitted powers by ~5dB, while keeping the maximum LTE nominal capacity. On the other hand, the results for large scale antenna arrays with 1024 elements show (55/30/24)dB lower values, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145585","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145585.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145585","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4G Multicell Systems with In-Band Full Duplex Relays: Using Beamforming to Lower Self-Interference and/or Transmitted Powers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"4G Multicell Systems with In-Band Full Duplex Relays: Using Beamforming to Lower Self-Interference and/or Transmitted Powers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145585/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145585/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288222","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4G Multicell Systems with In-Band Full Duplex Relays: Using Beamforming to Lower Self-Interference and/or Transmitted Powers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062265S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145586,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, different DL/UL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells will result in new destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, a feasible UL power control mechanism is proposed to manage eNB-to-eNB interference, where different UL power control parameters are set based on different interference level. We consider the geometric location information and the subframe set selection process about adjacent eNBs when the interference level is estimated. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the scheme can achieve preferable improvement in terms of UL average and 5%-ile packet throughputs compared with the original scheme without power control. Also, the UE-to-UE interference is not worse when the UE transmit power become higher.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145591","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145591.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145591","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Closed-Loop UL Power Control Scheme for Interference Mitigation in Dynamic TD-LTE Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Closed-Loop UL Power Control Scheme for Interference Mitigation in Dynamic TD-LTE Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145591/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Closed-Loop UL Power Control Scheme for Interference Mitigation in Dynamic TD-LTE Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10076S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145592,"authors":[{"name":"Fiona Ni Mhearain","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"Fiona","lastName":"Ni Mhearain","id":"37087839355"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37085484838"},{"name":"Fernando Perez-Fontan","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Perez-Fontan","id":"38274302000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145592","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"abstract":"We present the statistical analysis of the output from three timeseries generators of the dual polarised multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) land mobile satellite (LMS).

And we further obtain the optimal sensing duration and detection threshold depending on the number of available channels to maximize the secondary throughput under the interference probability constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed cross-layer method can improve the secondary throughput performance significantly.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145595","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145595.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145595","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Aware Sensing-Throughput Tradeoff for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Aware Sensing-Throughput Tradeoff for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145595/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288246","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Aware Sensing-Throughput Tradeoff for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158730.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083857S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145596,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085577406"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404294100"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"},{"name":"Yupeng Cui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085577141"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145596","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Complexity theory","Sparse matrices","Matrix converters","Hardware","Generators","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-information conversion","compressed sampling","AIC","K branches of mixer and integrator","BMI","MWC complexity reduction","diagonal modulated wideband converter","D-MWC","sparse matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145596","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Diagonal Structure for Analog-to-Information Conversion in Compressed Sampling","abstract":"Analog-to-information conversion (AIC) is an efficient way to obtain the compressed samples directly from an analog signal.

However, MWC has high implementation complexity owing to the fact that its measurement matrix is dense. To reduce the complexity of MWC, in this paper we propose the diagonal modulated wideband converter (D-MWC), where each BMI only works within a partial time period that is non-overlapping instead of each BMI working all the time in MWC. The measurement matrix of D-MWC is sparse that can significantly simplify the sampling structure. Simulations verify the effectiveness of D-MWC.

In this paper, we initiate a study to investigate the feasibility of distributed relay beamforming (DRBF) in a TP-WNP with the aim to enhance its reliability (and latency) performance even further. Specifically, we consider employing N i) amplify-and-forward (AF), ii) decode-and-forward (DF) relays in a wireless network running a TP-WNP. The relays operate in FDD mode, and do distributed transmit beamforming to realize low-latency, highly-reliable communication between each of the M source-destination pairs in the TP-WNP (a.k.a TDMA) system. The enablers/pre-requisites for the proposed DRBF-TDMA system are frequency, phase and timing synchronization among the relay nodes. To this end, we propose a novel distributed method for frequency synchronization among the AF/DF relay nodes operating in FDD mode. Furthermore, for oscillators with drift, we derive a rule of thumb which provides us the maximum relaying delay T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">delay</sub>\n up to which the proposed frequency synchronization method is effective.

However, the constant appearance of EVEs was generally assumed. In other words, these works focused on how to escape from being overheard rather than designing a complete transmission scheme with random appearances of EVEs. Thus, in this paper, we take the random appearances into consideration when designing a cooperative transmission scheme in the cognitive radio network using the anti-EVE cluster beamforming (CB) strategy. When EVE is not observed, the proposed cooperative scheme based on the fair three-stage Stackelberg (FTS) game is carried out; otherwise, the conventional CB cooperative scheme without eavesdropper's channel state information is executed. In the FTS game, the cluster of SUs first determines the transmission power to help PU for packet transmissions. Afterwards, PU can also adjust its willingness of sharing transmission time. To avoid extremely selfish time allocation by PU, a referee can make a fair judgement on the time sharing based on the minimization of the difference between PU's and SUs' utility functions. Compared with the conventional method, the superior performance in the sum transmission rates and power efficiency are proved by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145604","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145604.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145604","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretical Cooperative Transmission Scheme Based on Anti-Eavesdropper Cluster Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theoretical Cooperative Transmission Scheme Based on Anti-Eavesdropper Cluster Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145604/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145604/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288318","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theoretical Cooperative Transmission Scheme Based on Anti-Eavesdropper Cluster Beamforming","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061289S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145606,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyun Chu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyun","lastName":"Chu","id":"37085361344"},{"name":"Pingping Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pingping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37269796700"},{"name":"Chencheng Yang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Chencheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085419967"},{"name":"Suheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Suheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085424601"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145606","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Interference","Fading","Silicon","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","cooperative communication","fading channels","multicast communication","probability","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-MGroup interference channel state information","CSI","interference-aware spectrum sharing transmission","probability density equality lemma","fading channel","5G wireless cellular network","multiple cooperative multicast groups","interference-aware outage probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145606","abstract":"In this work, we consider outage performance for a 5G wireless cellular network consisting of multiple cooperative multicast groups (MGroups) under kinds of fading channels, which allows users adhering to different MGroups can be served simultaneously.

After then, based on the proposed probability density equality lemma, we also analyze average outage probability upper bound under kinds of fading channels with inter-MGroup interferences.

Extending conventional FTN receivers for severely time- dispersive channels is not an option, since the receiver complexity becomes prohibitively high. In this paper we address the design of a receiver for FTN signaling over severely time-dispersive channels. To cope with the severe ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference) associated to the combined effects of FTN signaling and the time-dispersive channel we consider an iterative FDE scheme (Frequency-Domain Equalization) combined with a HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest) especially designed taking into account the characteristics of FTN signals. We also present a simple, yet accurate model for the performance evaluation, considering multiple retransmissions per block. Our performance results show that we can have significant throughput gains, while maintaining essentially the receiver complexity of conventional, Nyquist-rate signaling schemes, even for severely time-dispersive channels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145609","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145609.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid ARQ Scheme for Faster than Nyquist Signaling with Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid ARQ Scheme for Faster than Nyquist Signaling with Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145609/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288156","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid ARQ Scheme for Faster than Nyquist Signaling with Iterative Frequency-Domain Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062174S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7145610,"authors":[{"name":"Mythri Hunukumbure","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of Europe Ltd, Hayes, Middlesex, UK"],"firstName":"Mythri","lastName":"Hunukumbure","id":"37327437800"},{"name":"Sunil Vadgama","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of Europe Ltd, Hayes, Middlesex, UK"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Vadgama","id":"37297155700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145610","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Servers","Legged locomotion","Ultrafast optics","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","radiofrequency interference","scheduling","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femto cells","overhearing","SON","scheduling","interference control","radio channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a coordinated scheduling/ interference control solution with Overhearing and limited SON control.

However, this can lead to more interference and accessibility issues. There are three types of femtocell access schemes currently, which are open, closed and hybrid access. While open access improves the overall network performance, closed access is a much more preferred by the end-user since it guarantees access to the femtocell owner. For this reason, hybrid access is a compromise which releases the femtocell access to the visitor when there is surplus resource left by the owner. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to solve the femtocell access issue by designing a joint multilevel priority scheduling and femtocell access policy based on a Matrix of Conflict RRM. It will be shown through computer simulation that the proposed scheduling and access policy provide network flexibility, for the femtocell owner and cellular provider, which can be utilized to achieve more benefits for both.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145611","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145611.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Access Policy Scheme with Matrix of Conflict RRM for Enhancing Femtocell Network Utilization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145611/","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Access Policy Scheme with Matrix of Conflict RRM for Enhancing Femtocell Network Utilization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288119","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145611/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Access Policy Scheme with Matrix of Conflict RRM for Enhancing Femtocell Network Utilization","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093018S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145617,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A large V-MIMO system that implements bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) transmission and compress-and-forward (CF) cooperation is considered. Since, constructing a reliable codebook is the most computationally complex task performed by the relay nodes, in this paper, we evaluate two low complexity quantization techniques. A comparison in terms of the codebook design and overhead complexity is presented. Error performance results show that the Lloyd - Max algorithm (LM-SQ) is simpler to design and can achieve a performance comparable to optimal Voronoi Vector Quantization (V-VQ). Further, Uniform Scalar Quantization (U-SQ) is also considered, as its low complexity makes it particularly suitable for the upcoming large wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145617","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145617.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Quantization Technique for Virtual MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145617/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Quantization Technique for Virtual MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287857","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145617/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Quantization Technique for Virtual MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049595S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145618,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085386318"},{"name":"Qian Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Han","id":"37085489965"},{"name":"Huazhe Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhe","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085483806"},{"name":"Zihao Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zihao","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085499904"},{"name":"Wenqian Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085385904"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145618","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":572},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Computational complexity","Antennas","OFDM","Convergence","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","linear codes","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity linear precoding","SOR method","massive MIMO systems","multiple input multiple output system","regularized zero forcing precoding","successive overrelaxation based precoding","matrix inversion approximation","asymptotically orthogonal channel property","fast convergence rate precoding"]}],"abstract":"Conventional linear precoding schemes in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, such as regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding, have near-optimal performance but suffer from high computational complexity due to the required matrix inversion of large size. To solve this problem, we propose a successive overrelaxation (SOR)-based precoding scheme to approximate the matrix inversion by exploiting the asymptotically orthogonal channel property in massive MIMO systems. The proposed SOR- based precoding can reduce the complexity by about one order of magnitude, and it can also approach the classical RZF precoding with negligible performance loss. We also prove that the proposed SOR-based precoding enjoys a faster convergence rate than the recently proposed Neumann-based precoding. In addition, to guarantee the performance of SOR-based precoding, we propose a simple way to choose the optimal relaxation parameter in practical massive MIMO systems. Simulation results verify the advantages of SOR-based precoding in convergence rate and computational complexity in typical massive MIMO configurations.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145618","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145618.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Linear Precoding Scheme Based on SOR Method for Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145618/","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Linear Precoding Scheme Based on SOR Method for Massive MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287986","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145618/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Linear Precoding Scheme Based on SOR Method for Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075897S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":7145620,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Merz","affiliation":["Swisscom Innovation, Bern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Merz","id":"37394026400"},{"name":"Adrian Schumacher","affiliation":["Swisscom Innovation, Bern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"37824585300"},{"name":"Nima Jamaly","affiliation":["Swisscom Innovation, Bern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Jamaly","id":"37318567800"},{"name":"Daniel Wenger","affiliation":["Swisscom Innovation, Bern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Wenger","id":"37085513113"},{"name":"Stefan Mauron","affiliation":["Swisscom Innovation, Bern, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Mauron","id":"37085523130"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145620","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"abstract":"Radiating cables (also known as leaky feeders) are often used to provide radio propagation in indoor and confined environments such as train passenger cars, aircraft cabins, subways or tunnels. Radiating cable deployments can typically provide more homogeneous and predictable coverage than deployments based on antennas. With the advent of 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the IEEE 802.11n and 802.11ac amendments, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) support has become mandatory. MIMO generally requires to deploy more than one radiating cable. While there has been a tremendous amount of work on MIMO antenna deployment configurations and the relationship with higher layer performance e.g. throughput (see also [1]), there is little work addressing MIMO radiating cable deployments with two or more cables. This paper presents results of an extensive measurement campaign conducted to assess MIMO propagation characteristics and the throughput performance of an LTE system in a dual radiating cable deployment in a passenger car. In particular, measurements presented in this paper show that two radiating cables can ideally support spatial multiplexing. Under favorable signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) conditions, throughput in excess of 130 Mbit/s were recorded for a 2\u00d72 MIMO 20 MHz LTE system. A median condition number of around 11 dB is measured for a 2\u00d72 MIMO deployment. More surprisingly, they also show that deploying two radiating cables next to each other does not significantly degrade performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Measurement Study of MIMO Support with Radiating Cables in Passenger Rail Cars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Throughput","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","automobiles","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","radiowave propagation","railway communication","telecommunication cables","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna deployment","SNR","signal-to-noise ratio","spatial multiplexing","MIMO propagation characteristics","MIMO radiating cable deployment","multiple input multiple output support measurement study","IEEE 802.11ac standard","IEEE 802.11n standard","3GPP LTE system","3GPP Long Term Evolution","confined environment","indoor environment","radio propagation","passenger rail cars"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Measurement Study of MIMO Support with Radiating Cables in Passenger Rail Cars","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145620/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288201","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Measurement Study of MIMO Support with Radiating Cables in Passenger Rail Cars","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045853S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145622,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Taha","affiliation":["Microwave and Communication Systems (MACS) Group, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Taha","id":"37085367263"},{"name":"Emad Alsusa","affiliation":["Microwave and Communication Systems (MACS) Group, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Alsusa","id":"37284811700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145622","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Indexes","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Security","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","private key cryptography","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM channel precoding based physical layer security technique","secret key exchange encryption","multiinput multioutput orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","precoding matrix index","key error rate","KER"]}],"abstract":"Secret key establishment is considered to be one of the main challenging issues in cryptography. Many security algorithms are implemented in practice using complicated mathematical methods to exchange secret keys, but those methods are not desirable in power limited terminals such as cellular and sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a physical layer method for exchanging secret key bits in precoding based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed method uniquely relates the key bits to the indices of the precoding matrix used for MIMO channel precoding. The basic idea of the technique is to utilize a MIMO-OFDM precoding codebook. Comparative analysis with respect to the average number of mismatch bits, named key error rate (KER), shows an interesting lead for the new method relative to existing work. In addition, it will be shown that the proposed technique requires lower computation per byte per secret key.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO Precoding Based Physical Layer Security Technique for Key Exchange Encryption","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145622","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145622.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A MIMO Precoding Based Physical Layer Security Technique for Key Exchange Encryption","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145622/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288241","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MIMO Precoding Based Physical Layer Security Technique for Key Exchange Encryption","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120314S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145624,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Wang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085438163"},{"name":"Min Jia","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085431085"},{"name":"Qing Guo","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532545100"},{"name":"Xuemai Gu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuemai","lastName":"Gu","id":"37535057400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145624","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Matrix converters","Logistics","Wideband","Sparse matrices","Hardware","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","probability","random sequences","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibit pseudorandom measurement matrix construction method","discrete chaotic sequence","MWC undersampling system","sparse wideband signal sampling","overwhelming sampling","probability","signal reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145624","abstract":"Modulated wideband converter system offers an under- sampling method aiming at the issue that sparse wideband signals require high sampling rates.

We consider a practical scenario where there is a realistic correlation among the antennas and imperfect channel estimation at the receiver side. The proposed scheme exploits the sparsity of the channel matrix for the effective selection of a limited number of antennas. To this end, we compute a sparse channel matrix by minimising the mean squared error. This optimisation problem is then solved by the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Widely used models for spatial correlation among the antennas and channel estimation errors are considered in this work. Simulation results demonstrate that when the impacts of spatial correlation and imperfect channel estimation introduced, the proposed scheme in the paper can significantly reduce complexity of the receiver, without degrading the system performance compared to the maximum ratio combining.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Antenna Selection Scheme for Spatially Correlated Massive MIMO Uplinks with Imperfect Channel Estimation","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145629","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145629.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Antenna Selection Scheme for Spatially Correlated Massive MIMO Uplinks with Imperfect Channel Estimation","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145629/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288097","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Antenna Selection Scheme for Spatially Correlated Massive MIMO Uplinks with Imperfect Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071955S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145634,"authors":[{"name":"Manman Cui","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Manman","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085364476"},{"name":"Bin-jie Hu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin-jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37401488200"},{"name":"Xiaohuan Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085344407"},{"name":"Hongbin Chen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology), Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407266800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145634","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Power control","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","MIMO communication","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output cognitive radio system","MIMO cognitive radio systems","noncooperative game theory","self-adaptive power threshold scheme","Nash equilibrium","signal-to-noise-plus interference ratio","SINR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel system model named as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio system (CRS) is built and an efficient uplink power control algorithm based on noncooperative game theory with a self-adaptive power threshold scheme is proposed to improve the power efficiency.

However, the standard SLM approach introduces additional data decoding challenges in the form of side information (SI) transmission and estimation. In general, SI transmission reduces data throughput and SI estimation normally involves computationally complex procedures, which increase design costs. To eliminate the need for both SI transmission and SI estimation, this paper presents an investigation into the PAPR reduction and BER performance of a new technique based on a modified SLM approach. It is shown that the proposed method simplifies data decoding through SI cancellation without SI transmission. Results show that the proposed method produces similar PAPR reduction performance and BER performance as standard SLM based OFDM system, which presumes perfect SI estimation, within a frequency non-selective (flat) fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145638","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145638.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PAPR Reduction and Data Decoding for SLM Based OFDM Systems without SI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145638/","displayDocTitle":"A PAPR Reduction and Data Decoding for SLM Based OFDM Systems without SI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288115","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145638/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PAPR Reduction and Data Decoding for SLM Based OFDM Systems without SI","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069996S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145639,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Liang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 30013, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chin-Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292503700"},{"name":"Jia-Li Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 30013, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jia-Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085384262"},{"name":"Shun-Sheng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 30013, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Shun-Sheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37696458200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145639","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Relays","Decoding","Interference","Wireless communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","block codes","compensation","cooperative communication","diversity reception","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial PIC based receiver design","space frequency block code","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency diversity","spatial diversity","carrier frequency offset","intercarrier interference","partial parallel interference cancellation","CFO compensation","SFBC decoding","iterative partial PIC","Alamouti coded SFBC-OFDM cooperative relay systems","distributed relays","SFBC decoder"]}],"abstract":"Space frequency block codes (SFBC) have been widely adopted with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to achieve both spatial and frequency diversity.

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity partial parallel interference cancellation (PIC) based receiver with common CFO compensation, modified SFBC decoding, and iterative partial PIC for Alamouti coded SFBC-OFDM cooperative relay systems. For the proposed receiver, the received signal is first compensated by a common CFO value to mitigate the effect of different CFOs from the distributed relays, and then the result is processed by a modified SFBC decoder. The decoded data is subsequently fed back to reconstruct the ICI for use in the developed partial PIC procedure. As compared with a previous related work, the proposed partial PIC based receiver achieves better performance with lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145639","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Partial PIC Based Receiver Design for SFBC-OFDM Cooperative Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Partial PIC Based Receiver Design for SFBC-OFDM Cooperative Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145639/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288333","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145639/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Partial PIC Based Receiver Design for SFBC-OFDM Cooperative Relay Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05276S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145640,"authors":[{"name":"Xabier Insausti","affiliation":["CEIT, TECNUN (University of Navarra), Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain"],"firstName":"Xabier","lastName":"Insausti","id":"38299356300"},{"name":"Aitziber Saez","affiliation":["CEIT, TECNUN (University of Navarra), Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain"],"firstName":"Aitziber","lastName":"Saez","id":"37085509251"},{"name":"Pedro M.

Efficient receiver implementations exist, which are close to CP-OFDM in terms of complexity. The UF-OFDM multi-carrier modulator, on the other hand, still has no efficient solution in the literature up to now. This paper addresses this problem and presents a novel frequency domain generation method for UF-OFDM, where overlapping subbands are superimposed. Our approach can bring down UF-OFDM multi-carrier modulator complexity almost as low as a factor of 2 above CP-OFDM, with a negligible approximation error. Thus the required efficient transmitter implementation is delivered by this paper's solution, ready to be used in hardware implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145643.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reduced Complexity Transmitter for UF-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Frequency-domain analysis","Approximation methods","Time-domain analysis","Transmitters","Modulation","Finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity transmitter","UF-OFDM","5G waveform","multicarrier modulator","frequency domain generation method","universal filtered OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Reduced Complexity Transmitter for UF-OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145643/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288162","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reduced Complexity Transmitter for UF-OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07849S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7145649,"authors":[{"name":"Mingming Gan","affiliation":["FTW Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Mingming","lastName":"Gan","id":"37085379798"},{"name":"Zhinan Xu","affiliation":["FTW Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Zhinan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085465807"},{"name":"Markus Hofer","affiliation":["FTW Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Hofer","id":"37076406800"},{"name":"Gerhard Steinbock","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Steinbock","id":"37426608500"},{"name":"Thomas Zemen","affiliation":["AIT Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria","FTW Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zemen","id":"37268211000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145649","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Scattering","Indexes","Antenna radiation patterns","Computational complexity","Ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","sequences","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna characteristics evaluation","basis coefficients","subspace dimension","geometrical information","2D DPS","discrete prolate spheroidal sequences","propagation path projection","spatial resolution","indoor positioning techniques","mobile terminal position","SDRT algorithm","computational complexity","realistic indoor environments","ultra wideband","UWB radiowave propagation","DPS subspace","sub-band divided ray tracing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Sub-band divided ray tracing (SDRT) is one technique that has been extensively used to obtain the channel characteristics for ultra-wideband (UWB) radio wave propagation in realistic indoor environments. However, the computational complexity of SDRT scales directly with the number of sub-bands. Although we have proposed a low-complexity SDRT algorithm for one terminal position [1], the computational complexity is still extremely high when involving multiple mobile terminal positions. Moreover, some indoor positioning techniques require for high positioning accuracy data from measurements/simulations with a very fine spatial resolution. To cope with this, we propose an algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of SDRT for multiple mobile terminal positions. The algorithm uses a projection of all propagation paths on a subspace spanned by two-dimensional discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences at each sub-band. It is important to note that, since the geometrical information of the propagation paths is the same in all sub-bands, the subspace dimension and basis coefficients in frequency dimension do not need to be recalculated at different sub-bands. We justify the simplifications of the proposed method by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of antenna characteristics on the proposed algorithm. Our proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity by more than one order of magnitude for indoor scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145649","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sub-Band Divided Ray Tracing Algorithm Using the DPS Subspace in UWB Indoor Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sub-Band Divided Ray Tracing Algorithm Using the DPS Subspace in UWB Indoor Scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145649/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287815","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145649/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sub-Band Divided Ray Tracing Algorithm Using the DPS Subspace in UWB Indoor Scenarios","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096571S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145651,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiyue Yan","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaiyue","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085473983"},{"name":"Yan Yang","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599952700"},{"name":"Shuping Dang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Shuping","lastName":"Dang","id":"37085453929"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145651","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"abstract":"The intra-tier interference in heterogeneous networks becomes more serious when the number of macro-femto cells dramatically increases. Based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, this paper proposes an optimized interference alignment (IA) algorithm to improve the macro-femto cell downlink rate. To achieve the largest degrees of freedom (DOF), we adopt the precoding matrix as a powerful tool to mitigate the effect of inter-channel interference (ICI). In comparison with the conventional interference coordination methods, the SVD algorithm is capable of adjusting the coefficients of the precoding matrix with lower complexity. Furthermore, zero-forcing algorithm is also used to combat ICI in this proposed IA algorithm. The numerical results show that ICI can be suppressed effectively and the system performance in terms of throughput and signal-to-interference- plus-noise ratio (SINR) can be improved considerably.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145651.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SVD-Based Optimum Algorithm Research for Macro-Femto Cell Interference Coordination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Macrocell networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","femtocellular radio","precoding","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macro-femto cell interference coordination","singular value decomposition","SVD","optimum algorithm research","intratier interference","heterogeneous networks","optimized interference alignment algorithm","macro-femto cell downlink rate","precoding matrix","interchannel interference","zero-forcing algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A SVD-Based Optimum Algorithm Research for Macro-Femto Cell Interference Coordination","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145651/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287917","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SVD-Based Optimum Algorithm Research for Macro-Femto Cell Interference Coordination","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1160120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13884S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145652,"authors":[{"name":"Azusa Danjo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Azusa","lastName":"Danjo","id":"37085419336"},{"name":"Yuki Watase","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Watase","id":"37085407941"},{"name":"Shinsuke Hara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Hara","id":"37276524200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145652","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Global Positioning System","Buildings","Wireless sensor networks","Accuracy","Three-dimensional displays","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","error analysis","Global Positioning System","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","indoor TOA localization scheme","unmanned aerial vehicles","global positioning system","GPS satellites","pre-installed wireless anchor nodes","time-of-arrival localization scheme","perturbation method"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is attractive for indoor localization where conventional localization means are unavailable such as global positioning system (GPS) satellites and pre-installed wireless anchor nodes. The advantage of indoor localization using UAVs is that even when only few UAVs are available, if each of them ranges a target node many times from different locations while flying around, the localization accuracy can be improved, because it virtually increases the number of UAVs, namely, anchor nodes. However, the locations of UAVs are also estimated by GPS, so they can contain some errors in themselves. Furthermore, the channels between UAVs and a target node are likely to be in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, so the NLOS range biases worsen the localization accuracy. In this paper, for time-of-arrival (TOA) localization scheme, we theoretically analyze the effects of UAV location errors and NLOS range errors on the indoor localization error. Using perturbation method in the theoretical analysis, we derive a simple equation connecting these errors and localization error, and discuss dominant factors and achievable accuracy using realistic system parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Error Analysis on Indoor TOA Localization Scheme Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145652","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145652.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Error Analysis on Indoor TOA Localization Scheme Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145652/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287907","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Error Analysis on Indoor TOA Localization Scheme Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047412S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145656,"authors":[{"name":"Chunbo Luo","affiliation":["UWS, School of Eng. & Computing, Paisley, UK"],"firstName":"Chunbo","lastName":"Luo","id":"38577949900"},{"name":"James Nightingale","affiliation":["UWS, School of Eng. & Computing, Paisley, UK"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Nightingale","id":"37704450800"},{"name":"Ekhorutomwen Asemota","affiliation":["Capgemini, Technology Services, UK"],"firstName":"Ekhorutomwen","lastName":"Asemota","id":"37085421287"},{"name":"Christos Grecos","affiliation":["Independent image consultant, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Grecos","id":"37294699300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145656","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":957},"abstract":"The application of small civilian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has attracted great interest for disaster sensing. However, the limited computational capability and low energy resource of UAVs present a significant challenge to real-time data processing, networking and policy making, which are of vital importance to many disaster related applications such as oil-spill detection and flooding. In order to address the challenges imposed by the sheer volume of captured data, particularly video data, the intermittent and limited network resources, and the limited resources on UAVs, a new cloud-supported UAV application framework has been proposed and a prototype system of such framework has been implemented in this paper. The framework integrates video acquisition, data scheduling, data offloading and processing, and network state measurement to deliver an efficient and scalable system. The prototype of the framework comprises of a client-side set of components hosted on the UAV which selectively offloads the captured data to a cloud-based server. The server provides real-time data processing and information feedback services to the incident control centre and client device/operator. Results of the prototype system are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145656.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A UAV-Cloud System for Disaster Sensing Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Prototypes","Sensors","Streaming media","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cloud computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information feedback services","cloud-based server","data offloading","data scheduling","video acquisition","flooding","oil-spill detection","policy making","networking","real-time data processing","small civilian unmanned aerial vehicles","disaster sensing","UAV-cloud system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A UAV-Cloud System for Disaster Sensing Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145656/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15301982","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A UAV-Cloud System for Disaster Sensing Applications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159940.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058733S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145659,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhakim Khlifi","affiliation":["Innov'COM Laboratory, Sup'Com University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Khlifi","id":"37085359901"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["Innov'COM Laboratory, Sup'Com University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37085336187"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145659","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Complexity theory","Correlation","Estimation","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","OFDM system","very low complexity LMMSE channel estimation","linear minimum mean square error","computational complexity","OFDM symbol","inversion matrix operation","channel autocorrelation matrix","FFT operation","circle shift operation","Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplication","bit error rate","BER"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a very low complexity Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) channel estimation technique for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

In the considered CR system, the secondary user (SU) senses and dynamically exploits the spectrum pool via dynamic frequency hopping. Since spectrum sensing is not perfect, miss-detection occurs. Under this event, the interference emerged from collisions due to the simultaneous spectrum access of both primary and cognitive users leads to a non-Gaussian CR link. This makes it very challenging to evaluate the information theoretical limits, especially when finite-alphabet inputs are used. To overcome such challenge, we first introduce a simple method to calculate the instantaneous differential entropy of the channel output for a given fading gain using Laguerre-Gauss quadrature formulas. Using this result, we propose a piece-wise linear curve fitting (PLCF)-based method to calculate the average output entropy and outage probability, respectively. It is then demonstrated that the average achievable rate in fast fading and the outage probability in slow fading of the considered CR channel can be calculated effectively to achieve any predetermined accuracy level for a given finite-alphabet input.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145664.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Rate and Outage Probability of Cognitive Radio with Finite-Alphabet Inputs under Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145664/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rate and Outage Probability of Cognitive Radio with Finite-Alphabet Inputs under Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287910","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Rate and Outage Probability of Cognitive Radio with Finite-Alphabet Inputs under Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072854S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145665,"authors":[{"name":"Longhai Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, P.R.

We investigate the secrecy rate maximization problem, which is a non-convex problem in terms of transmit covariance matrices of the legitimate transmitter and the cooperative jammer. In order to circumvent this issue, we develop an optimization algorithm by alternating optimizing the transmit covariance matrices of the legitimate transmitter and the cooperative jammer where each transmit covariance matrix is optimized while other is fixed. Based on this algorithm, we develop a robust scheme by incorporating channel uncertainties associated with the eavesdropper. By exploiting S-Procedure, we show that these robust optimization problems can be formulated into semidefinite programming (SDP).

Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve the (L-1) degrees of freedom for each user.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145680","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145680.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Alignment Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145680/","displayDocTitle":"An Alignment Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288060","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145680/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Alignment Based Interference Cancellation Scheme for Multi-Cell MIMO Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043545S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145684,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi H.

Further, a non- parametric threshold is derived and used to determine how many occupied channels are presented. The proposed method exhibits a probability of detection of 96% at -12 dB. Further, a gain of 11 dB is achieved when comparing this method with other EMD-based spectrum sensing approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145684.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EMD-Based Spectrum Sensing Technique for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145684/","displayDocTitle":"An EMD-Based Spectrum Sensing Technique for Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288089","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EMD-Based Spectrum Sensing Technique for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056833S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145685,"authors":[{"name":"Kyle Jung-Lin Pan","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., Melville, NY"],"firstName":"Kyle Jung-Lin","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085364049"},{"name":"Lingchen Zhu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Lingchen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085348738"},{"name":"Tanbir Haque","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., Melville, NY"],"firstName":"Tanbir","lastName":"Haque","id":"37373349300"},{"name":"James H.

In case the received spectrum is underutilized, compressed sensing (CS) enables us to operate at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate for lower device cost, higher data transmission rate and faster spectrum sensing speed. To improve the receiver performance under a mutually interfering and noisy environments, a resource block (RB)-detection based iterative interference cancellation algorithm for LTE OFDMA signals is presented. Active RBs are blindly detected in order to improve performance of the proposed CS-based receiver. Specifically, the RBs of active users are estimated by minimum mean square error (MMSE) and those of interference users are estimated via \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n- norm minimization in a semi-blind manner, both in compressive signal domain. By canceling the interferences directly from compressive measurements iteratively, the proposed algorithm improves the estimates of both the desired and interfering signals.

However, network densification comes with the cost of increased interference. Another related consequence would be that the interference level gets more unstable, which seriously affect the accuracy of uplink link adaptation. Cooperative interference prediction (CIP) has been proposed to alleviate the issue. Nevertheless, the effects of CIP depend on various factors which have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate how data retransmission and power control affect the performance of CIP in indoor hotspot scenarios via intensive system level simulations. It is confirmed that there are strong correlations between retransmission rate, power control and the performance of CIP. These simulation results provide insights into how dense indoor network can be optimized using CIP.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Power control","Uplink","Resource management","Estimation error","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","indoor radio","Long Term Evolution","power control","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative interference prediction","LTE-A indoor hotspot scenarios","low power base station","high-speed wireless services","interference level","uplink link adaptation","CIP","data retransmission rate","power control","intensive system level simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145690","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145690.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation on Cooperative Interference Prediction in LTE-A Indoor Hotspot Scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation on Cooperative Interference Prediction in LTE-A Indoor Hotspot Scenarios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145690/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145690/","accessionNumber":"15287839","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation on Cooperative Interference Prediction in LTE-A Indoor Hotspot Scenarios","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069324S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7145694,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A considerable improvement of system performance can be generally achieved by mitigating interference, as a result of applying the CR idea over the above model. We also study the implication of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based power control (PC) strategy per femto user in interference-limited networks over the above model to guarantee a certain value of coverage probability for a given signal-to-interference- plus-noise-ratio (SINR) target.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Coverage Probability in Two-Tier Cognitive Femto Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145703","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Evaluation of Coverage Probability in Two-Tier Cognitive Femto Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145703/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Evaluation of Coverage Probability in Two-Tier Cognitive Femto Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052422S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145705,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Garcia-Morales","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma, Spain"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Garcia-Morales","id":"37085591643"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"},{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145705","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Interference","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Buildings","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wall penetration losses","FBS","femtobase station","MBS","macrobase station","resource block scheduling policy","FFR parameters","fractional frequency reuse","FUE","femto-user-equipments","MUE","macrouser-equipments","cotier interferences","femtocell tiers","intertier interference","two-tier HetNets","5G networks","4G networks","macrocellular network","two-tier wireless architectures","heterogeneous cellular networks","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"Two-tier wireless architectures where the macro- cellular network is complemented with a deployment of femto-cells are becoming an attractive solution to increase the global throughput in the context of OFDMA-based 4G/5G networks.

A worst-case scenario in terms of inter- tier interference is evaluated in which macrocell and femtocell tiers are assumed to be uncoordinated and co-channel deployed. The proposed framework allows the evaluation of the impact produced by both inter- and co-tier interferences on either the macro-user-equipments (MUEs) or the femto-user-equipments (FUEs). Analytical performance results are used to optimise the FFR parameters as a function of, for instance, the resource block scheduling policy used at both the MBSs and the FBSs, the number of MUEs per cell, the density of FBSs per area unit or the degree of isolation provided by wall penetration losses.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145705","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of OFDMA-Based Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Using FFR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of OFDMA-Based Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Using FFR","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145705/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287899","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145705/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Performance Evaluation of OFDMA-Based Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Using FFR","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075592S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145707,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Chernov","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Chernov","id":"37701702100"},{"name":"Michael Cochez","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Cochez","id":"37085408559"},{"name":"Tapani Ristaniemi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Tapani","lastName":"Ristaniemi","id":"37282833000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145707","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Training","Testing","Histograms","Data mining","Probabilistic logic","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data mining","Long Term Evolution","multi-access systems","probability","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MDT functionality","minimization of drive testing","LTE system simulator","precision-recall curves","ROC","receiver operating characteristic","probabilistic based methods","centroid distance","base station","user equipment","data mining","malfunctioning cells","RACH failure","random access channel","network service","cell outage","LTE networks","Long-Term Evolution","cell degradation","sleeping cell detection","anomaly detection algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The Sleeping Cell problem is a particular type of cell degradation in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks. In practice such cell outage leads to the lack of network service and sometimes it can be revealed only after multiple user complains by an operator. In this study a cell becomes sleeping because of a Random Access Channel (RACH) failure, which may happen due to software or hardware problems. For the detection of malfunctioning cells, we introduce a data mining based framework. In its core is the analysis of event sequences reported by a User Equipment (UE) to a serving Base Station (BS). The crucial element of the developed framework is an anomaly detection algorithm. We compare performances of distance, centroid distance and probabilistic based methods, using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall curves. Moreover, the theoretical comparison of the methods' computational efficiencies is provided. The sleeping cell detection framework is verified by means of a dynamic LTE system simulator, using Minimization of Drive Testing (MDT) functionality. It is shown that the sleeping cell can be pinpointed.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145707","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145707.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms for the Sleeping Cell Detection in LTE Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145707/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms for the Sleeping Cell Detection in LTE Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288191","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145707/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms for the Sleeping Cell Detection in LTE Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060734S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7145710,"authors":[{"name":"Hironori Kusumoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironori","lastName":"Kusumoto","id":"38542586600"},{"name":"Hiraku Okada","affiliation":["EcoTopia Science Institute, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiraku","lastName":"Okada","id":"37273515400"},{"name":"Kentaro Kobayashi","affiliation":["EcoTopia Science Institute, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37599619400"},{"name":"Masaaki Katayama","affiliation":["EcoTopia Science Institute, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Katayama","id":"37276468500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145710","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","MIMO","Interference","Wireless mesh networks","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","telecommunication network topology","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area transmission efficiency","single-user MIMO","multi-user MIMO","grid-topology wireless mesh networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose area transmission efficiency to evaluate the performance of single-user multiple-input multiple-output (SU-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) in wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The area transmission efficiency is the number of packets that can be transmitted per unit time and per area, and is calculated by considering the multiplexing effect of MIMO and the density of transmitting nodes. The performance of SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO is evaluated and compared in term of the area transmission efficiency in WMNs. As a result, the area transmission efficiency of MU-MIMO can be superior to that of SU-MIMO when the number of queueing packets is small. Conversely, this relationship is reversed when the number of queueing packets is enough large. In addition, by selecting the transmission packets so as to reduce the number of receiving nodes, MU-MIMO is always superior to SU-MIMO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area Transmission Efficiency of Single-User and Multi-User MIMO in Grid-Topology Wireless Mesh Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145710","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Area Transmission Efficiency of Single-User and Multi-User MIMO in Grid-Topology Wireless Mesh Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145710/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287944","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area Transmission Efficiency of Single-User and Multi-User MIMO in Grid-Topology Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057341S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145713,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Zou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing, P.

This is due to the strong expectations that M2M communications will be a main element of the overall traffic over 5G networks. The diversity of M2M applications strongly motivates studying the problem of resource allocation in the uplink direction where the M2M traffic is dominant. M2M communications impose requirements that differ from those required by Human-to-Human (H2H) communications. We present a classification of M2M scheduling techniques from the perspective of these requirements. We then propose an M2M uplink scheduling algorithm that offers a balance between throughput and delay requirements. It is also adaptive to traffic characteristics since it considers both channel state and system deadlines in an adjustable manner according to network needs. Finally, we conduct experiments to compare the performance of the proposed technique to that of other schedulers that belong to the different M2M scheduler categories.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145714.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BAT: A Balanced Alternating Technique for M2M Uplink Scheduling over LTE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Scheduling","Uplink","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BAT","balanced alternating technique","M2M uplink scheduling algorithm","LTE network","machine-to-machine scheduling","Long Term Evolution","5G network","resource allocation","M2M traffic characteristic","human-to-human communication","H2H communication","channel state"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"BAT: A Balanced Alternating Technique for M2M Uplink Scheduling over LTE","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288363","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BAT: A Balanced Alternating Technique for M2M Uplink Scheduling over LTE","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058794S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7145715,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hao Yu","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085364786"},{"name":"Ming-Po Chang","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Po","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085343752"},{"name":"Jiann-Ching Guey","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jiann-Ching","lastName":"Guey","id":"37354594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145715","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":398},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Antenna measurements","Array signal processing","Complexity theory","Antennas","Baseband","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","computational complexity","space division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam space selection","hybrid beamforming millimeter wave communication","mm-Wave communication system","spatial multiplexing theory","computational effort","channel throughput estimation","beam space reduction method"]}],"abstract":"We address beam space reduction method inside which proper analog beamformers are selected for hybrid beamforming millimeter Wave (mmWave) system.

Simulation results demonstrate that near-optimal performance can be achieved with significantly reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145715","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145715","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Space Selection for High Rank Millimeter Wave Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beam Space Selection for High Rank Millimeter Wave Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145715/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288269","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Space Selection for High Rank Millimeter Wave Communication","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04469S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145716,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Sabella","affiliation":["Telecom Italia"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Sabella","id":"37545454000"},{"name":"Peter Rost","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Rost","id":"37294102200"},{"name":"Albert Banchs","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Banchs","id":"37085385776"},{"name":"Valentin Savin","affiliation":["CEA-LETI"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Savin","id":"37605871100"},{"name":"Marco Consonni","affiliation":["HP Italy Innovation Center"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Consonni","id":"37085392322"},{"name":"Marco Di Girolamo","affiliation":["HP Italy Innovation Center"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Girolamo","id":"37085394010"},{"name":"Massinissa Lalam","affiliation":["Sagemcom Broadband"],"firstName":"Massinissa","lastName":"Lalam","id":"37568647600"},{"name":"Andreas Maeder","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Maeder","id":"37706201700"},{"name":"Ignacio Berberana","affiliation":["Telefonica I+D"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Berberana","id":"37349350500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145716","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":734},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Computer architecture","Radio access networks","Baseband","Software","Digital signal processing","Virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","cloud computing","Long Term Evolution","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3GPP LTE throughput","radio access point","cloud platform","5G system latency","Cloud-RAN architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the practical implementation of a Cloud-RAN architecture in the context of future 5G systems, with particular emphasis on different aspects of the functional split between the cloud platform and the radio access points.

We further discuss a virtualized infrastructure which may have a significant impact on how algorithms are implemented, how they interact with each other, and how they can be scaled within the RAN. We also analyze implementation constraints to be considered to provide backwards compatibility with 3GPP LTE; such constraints on the computing platforms result from the RAN requirements in terms of latency and throughput.

In this paper, a subspace-based channel estimation algorithm with a two-step signal matrix construction method is proposed. The probability of full row rank of the proposed signal matrix is very close to one even if few OFDM blocks are available. The proposed approach can also be applied to both cyclic prefix (CP)-based and non-CP-based OFDM systems whereas the conventional approach is only suitable for CP-based systems. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms related blind channel estimation approaches in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE).","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145717","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145717.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for CP/CP-Free OFDM Systems Using Subspace Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145717/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation for CP/CP-Free OFDM Systems Using Subspace Approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288369","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145717/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Channel Estimation for CP/CP-Free OFDM Systems Using Subspace Approach","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049957S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145719,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Langowski","affiliation":["Chair of Wireless Communications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Langowski","id":"37869407400"},{"name":"Krzysztof Wesolowski","affiliation":["Chair of Wireless Communications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wesolowski","id":"37294622900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145719","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Minimization","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Partial transmit sequences","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","minimisation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLM methods","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM transmission","PAPR minimization","peak- to-average power ratio","MIMO STBC V2V transmission","block wise PAPR minimization algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an efficient method of peak- to-average power ratio (PAPR) minimization in the space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission.

The main idea of the proposed CAC strategy relies on reducing the weight of the current number of secondary VoIP sessions in the admission/rejection decision criterion, which can potentially allow more efficient spectrum usage. To show this, the maximum VoIP Erlang capacity achieved by the proposed CAC strategy is calculated. Compared to the conventional (occupancy-based) CAC strategy, our proposed \"differentiated resource occupancy-aware\" CAC scheme increases Erlang capacity without an important increase in the system complexity cost. This indicates that in a CRN with VoIP traffic, system capacity not only depends on the total number of busy channels but also on the proportion of busy channels that are used by primary users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287964","htmlLink":"/document/7145724/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Call Admission Control Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks with VoIP-Traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call Admission Control Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks with VoIP-Traffic","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067967S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145725,"authors":[{"name":"Sana Ezzine","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France","Syscom Laboratory, Engineering school of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Ezzine","id":"37085490567"},{"name":"Fatma Abdelkefi","affiliation":["Mediatron Laboratory, High School of Communications, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Abdelkefi","id":"38478613200"},{"name":"Jean Pierre Cances","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Jean Pierre","lastName":"Cances","id":"37281346000"},{"name":"Vahid Meghdadi","affiliation":["XLIM, University of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Meghdadi","id":"37281340800"},{"name":"Ammar Bouallegue","affiliation":["Syscom Laboratory, Engineering school of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ammar","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37285012400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145725","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Channel capacity","OFDM","Noise","Cooperative communication","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","carrier transmission on power lines","channel capacity","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","encoding","OFDM modulation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay","coding techniques","cooperation relaying protocol","Fountain code and forward protocol","decode and forward relaying protocols","amplify and forward relaying protocols","relay node","OFDM based two hop relaying","channel capacity","cooperative communication","fading channel","efficient communication","smart grid deployment","power line communication","PLC systems","OFDM based two hops relaying","capacity analysis"]}],"abstract":"Power Line Communication (PLC) remains the most appropriate communication architectures and technology for Smart Grid (SG) deployment. A major challenge for researchers in SG, is how to supply robust and efficient communication since PLC channel is a fading channel whose characteristics vary considerably over long distances and at high frequencies. To reach this goal, cooperative communication has been proven to be effective. Thus in this paper, we derive the channel capacity for OFDM-based two-hop relaying PLC system where we use a relay node between the source and destination nodes. We analyze channel capacity for Amplify-and-Forward (AF), Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying protocols and Fountain-code-and-Forward (FCF) protocol which joint cooperative relay and coding techniques. We highlight in this paper how the use of this new category of cooperation relaying protocol (FCF) increases channel capacity of an OFDM-based two-hop relaying PLC system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of an OFDM-Based Two-Hops Relaying PLC Systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145725","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of an OFDM-Based Two-Hops Relaying PLC Systems","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145725/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288270","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of an OFDM-Based Two-Hops Relaying PLC Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064875S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145727,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Tai Do","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Tan Tai","lastName":"Do","id":"37073918200"},{"name":"Su Min Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Su Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085352963"},{"name":"Tobias J.

To exploit the beamforming implemented by multiple antenna devices, proper algorithms to estimate the channel need to be designed. In this work we propose a novel channel estimation method for MMW systems where both transmitter and receiver are equipped with fewer radio frequency chains than antennas and implement hybrid analog-digital beamforming. First, we define a training sequence which includes a set of analog and digital beamformers to probe the channel. Then, we develop an algorithm which estimates the channel parameters directly rather than the multiantenna channel matrix and it is based on the two dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the received training samples. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation method even in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145736.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation Using a 2D DFT for Millimeter-Wave Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Channel estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Array signal processing","Training","Millimeter wave technology","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","millimetre wave receivers","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low signal to noise ratio","multiantenna channel matrix","hybrid analog-digital beamforming","receiver","transmitter","MMW systems","channel estimation method","millimeter-wave systems","2D discrete Fourier transform","2D DFT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Using a 2D DFT for Millimeter-Wave Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145736/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145736/","accessionNumber":"15287909","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Using a 2D DFT for Millimeter-Wave Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051749S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7145738,"authors":[{"name":"Ang-Hsun Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, National Defense University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ang-Hsun","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37543026400"},{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280758200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145738","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Reliability","Macrocell networks","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel allocation","femtocellular radio","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel-oriented channel allocation scheme","multi-antenna OFDMA femtocells","link reliability","spectrum efficiency","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","channel gains"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145738","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Oriented Channel Allocation Scheme (COCAS) for Multi-Antenna OFDMA Femtocells","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a low-complexity distributed channel-oriented channel allocation scheme (COCAS) to improve the link reliability of users and the spectrum efficiency of femtocells for multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based femtocell systems.

This aspect can dramatically damage the waveforms orthogonality that is induced in the Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Consequently, this results in oppressive Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which leads to performance degradation in OFDM systems. To efficiently overcome these drawbacks, we propose Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM ) algorithm that maximizes the received Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) by optimizing systematically the OFDM waveforms at the Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) sides. We derived the exact closed-form expression of the SINR of the considered multicarrier system and the optimized waveform is searched as a linear combination of several of the most localized Hermite functions. Then, we go further by testing its robustness against time synchronization errors. The results confirm the advantage behind POPS-OFDM algorithm in enhancing spectacular performance and its robustness compared to multicarrier systems using conventional waveforms.

However, those algorithms may face some constraints -- the IB-DFE has some difficulty picking certain signals up if they are considerably weaker than the rest and the computational effort grows exponentially with the number of signals to be detected. In this paper we present a clustered multiuser detection scheme, based on an IB-DFE algorithm. It is demonstrated that if the mobile terminals (MTs) have enough power and are distributed in clusters, with considerable power difference between them, it is possible to successfully detect them all while containing the computational complexity. Our scheme also requires fewer receiving antennas than the original IB-DFE implementations and, with the aid of low-density parity- check (LDPC) and turbo- equalization, it is able to reach high performance levels with low power requirements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145747","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145747.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered Multiuser Detection Using SC-FDE Transmission with Iterative Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Clustered Multiuser Detection Using SC-FDE Transmission with Iterative Receivers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288360","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145747/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered Multiuser Detection Using SC-FDE Transmission with Iterative Receivers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050831S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7145750,"authors":[{"name":"Abdallah Moubayed","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Department, KAUST, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Moubayed","id":"38264414400"},{"name":"Sameh Sorour","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, KFUPM, Dhahran, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sameh","lastName":"Sorour","id":"37322189000"},{"name":"Tareq Al-Naffouri","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Department, KAUST, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Tareq","lastName":"Al-Naffouri","id":"37085383496"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Department, KAUST, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37085389708"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145750","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Cognitive radio","Base stations","Network coding","Interference","Automatic repeat request","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","network coding","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prioritized multi-layer network coding scheme","collaborative packet recovery","hybrid cellular cognitive radio networks","collocated primary base-stations","cognitive radio base-stations","packet recovery overheads","primary network","interference threshold","spectrum holes","cognitive radio base station","secondary network","primary packet arrivals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145750","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145750","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","abstract":"In this paper, as an extension to [1], we propose a prioritized multi-layer network coding scheme for collaborative packet recovery in hybrid (interweave and underlay) cellular cognitive radio networks.

The proposed scheme ensures that each network's performance is not degraded by its help to the other network. Moreover, it guarantees that the primary network's interference threshold is not violated in the same and adjacent cells. Yet, the scheme allows the reduction of the recovery overhead in the collocated primary and cognitive radio networks. The reduction in the cognitive radio network is further amplified due to the perfect detection of spectrum holes which allows the cognitive radio base station to transmit at higher power without fear of violating the interference threshold of the primary network. For the secondary network, simulation results show reductions of 20% and 34% in the packet recovery overhead, compared to the non-collaborative scheme, for low and high probabilities of primary packet arrivals, respectively.

To address all these challenges, we propose a combination of compressed sensing based detection known as Compressed Sensing based Multi User Detection (CS-MUD) with multicarrier access schemes. We name this novel combination Multicarrier CS-MUD (MCSM). Previous investigations on CS-MUD facilitates massive direct random access by exploiting the signal sparsity caused by sporadic sensor activity.

However, the complexity of detection algorithms is very high even if no iteration is considered. Single tree search is a very powerful detection algorithm in the iterative detection of MIMO, which combines tree searches of all byte into a single tree search (STS). But inherited from the complexity of nonlinear detection algorithm, the STS algorithm is still too complicated in many scenarios. In this article, we proposed that byte whose values of log likelihood ratio (LLR) are large enough are good enough for detecting and need no further updating. We set threshold in detection. A tree where LLR values of all byte are larger than it is free of update. As a result, a lot of calculation of search can be reduced, and the complexity can be reduced lot while the performance loss is very small.

Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework, under which the performance of the whole system could be substantially improved.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145761","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145761.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145761","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative ARQ Retransmission Based Spectrum Leasing for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative ARQ Retransmission Based Spectrum Leasing for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145761/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145761/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288343","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative ARQ Retransmission Based Spectrum Leasing for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088182S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145764,"authors":[{"name":"Ahsan Adeel","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University"],"firstName":"Ahsan","lastName":"Adeel","id":"37085357176"},{"name":"Hadi Larijani","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Larijani","id":"37660795600"},{"name":"Abbas Javed","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Javed","id":"37085497380"},{"name":"Ali Ahmadinia","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ahmadinia","id":"37265198500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145764","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial intelligence","Neurons","Decision making","Mathematical model","Cognitive radio","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","cognitive radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","Long Term Evolution","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential evolution","AIW-PSO","adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization","learning algorithms","CE architecture","random neural network","ICIC","adjacent cell","optimal radio parameter","intercell interference coordination","optimal radio parameter prediction","e-NodeB","cognitive engine","LTE-UL system","long term evolution-uplink"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145764","abstract":"In this paper, we critically analyze the performance of an intelligent Long-Term Evolution-Uplink (LTE-UL) system having a cognitive engine (CE) embedded in e-NodeB.

The embedded CE allocates the optimal radio parameters to serving users and suggests the acceptable transmit power to users served by adjacent cells for ICIC. The desired cognition has been achieved with a novel random neural network (RNN) based CE architecture. To achieve the best learning performance, we critically analyzed three learning algorithms, gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIW-PSO) and differential evolution (DE). The analysis showed that AIW-PSO was 10.57% better than GD and 8.012% better than DE in terms of learning accuracy (based on MSE), but with considerable compromise on computational time as compared to GD. Moreover, in terms of convergence time (to achieve the MSE less than 1.04E-03), AIW-PSO took 60% less iterations than GD and 50% less than DE.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145764","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145764.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critical Analysis of Learning Algorithms in Random Neural Network Based Cognitive Engine for LTE Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145764/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Critical Analysis of Learning Algorithms in Random Neural Network Based Cognitive Engine for LTE Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145764/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15288323","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critical Analysis of Learning Algorithms in Random Neural Network Based Cognitive Engine for LTE Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066687S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145765,"authors":[{"name":"Ponnu Jacob","affiliation":["NTU, School of Computer Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ponnu","lastName":"Jacob","id":"38241572900"},{"name":"A.

However, uncoordinated dense deployment of femtocells in a macrocell network pose unique challenges involving cross-tier interference and resource management which may lead to significant performance degradation in the system. As part of addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross- Polarized Complementary Frequency Allocation (CPCFA) strategy which exploits frequency and polarization diversity to mitigate interference in two-tier femto-macro networks. This strategy combines the benefits of reverse frequency allocation (RFA) and orthogonal polarized transmission which is analyzed as a potential solution for maximizing spectral efficiency and minimizing interference in heterogeneous networks. The results of analytic and simulation studies prove that CPCFA increases the scope for an easily implementable, remarkable opportunity in the context of two-tier femto-macro network that can substantially increase the system capacity, area of interference-free femtocell exclusive region as well as the coverage probability without additional network complexities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Polarized Complementary Frequency Allocation in Femto-Macro Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145765","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Polarized Complementary Frequency Allocation in Femto-Macro Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145765/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287841","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Polarized Complementary Frequency Allocation in Femto-Macro Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048179S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145766,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Kurras","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kurras","id":"37395684500"},{"name":"Stephan Jaeckel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Jaeckel","id":"37296970700"},{"name":"Lars Thiele","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37289376400"},{"name":"Volker Braun","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Braun","id":"38490996500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145766","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Delays","OFDM","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI compression","network MIMO","multicell system","multiple antennas","base stations","joint transmission","linear zero forcing beamforming","channel state information","CSI feedback","3D channel model","antenna patterns","feedback data format","feedback rate"]}],"abstract":"We consider the downlink of a multi-cell system where base stations and users are equipped with multiple antennas.

Latency reductions in OFDM require substantial reductions in the OFDM symbol lengths, which are limited by the cyclic prefix length according to the maximum channel delay spread to be supported. This paper explores a new scheme that achieves significant overhead reduction by leaving only the cyclic prefix corresponding to the first OFDM symbol and removing the remaining ones in a time transmission interval, while modifying the general transmission procedure. An algorithm is proposed at the receiver for cancellation of any inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference appearing in multipath channels, which benefits from significantly low computational complexity. Link-level simulations show excellent results in terms of block error rate and achievable throughput when applied to an LTE system, therefore allowing for significant symbol length reductions and reduced air interface latencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic Prefix Overhead Reduction for Low-Latency Wireless Communications in OFDM","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145767","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145767.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic Prefix Overhead Reduction for Low-Latency Wireless Communications in OFDM","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145767/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288258","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic Prefix Overhead Reduction for Low-Latency Wireless Communications in OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076334S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145768,"authors":[{"name":"Guanyu Zhang","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Guanyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085344913"},{"name":"Simon Armour","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Armour","id":"37271546200"},{"name":"Joseph P.

Since SC signals generally have the large envelope variation in frequency spectrum, the subcarrier signals with the small magnitude cause the noise enhancement. The proposed scheme adopts DFCE only for the subcarriers with the relatively large magnitude. Moreover, the proposed scheme adaptively controls the forgetting factor according to the channel condition such as noise dominant channel and time selectivity dominant channel. The feature of the proposed approach is to theoretically derive the effect of time selective fading by using the terminal speed and to detect the actual channel condition. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in comparison with the traditional DFCE with the fixed forgetting factor by means of computer simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145769.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Scheme Using Terminal Speed for Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145769","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Scheme Using Terminal Speed for Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145769/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15288127","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145769/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Scheme Using Terminal Speed for Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049801S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145770,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Morozov","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, University of Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Morozov","id":"37722588400"},{"name":"Alexei Davydov","affiliation":["Mobile and Communications Group, University of Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Davydov","id":"37544143600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"Parameter estimation of interfering signals transmitted by neighboring cells has become one of the important signal processing problems for Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) systems. Knowledge of the interfering signal parameters is required to improve the downlink performance in interference-limited scenarios by providing estimated parameters to non-linear interference cancellation and suppression receivers, such as maximum likelihood (ML) and symbol-level interference cancellation (SLIC). In this paper, we consider the problem of interfering signal parameter estimation (blind detection) in the presence of the useful signal with known parameters transmitted by the serving cell. To improve the performance of parameter estimation, soft cancellation of the serving signal after linear Minimum Mean Squared Error Interference Rejection Combining (MMSE-IRC) and turbo decoding is proposed. The parameters of the interfering signals such as precoding vectors, number of spatial layers and power boosting are estimated after soft compensation of the useful signal and are subsequently used in non-linear receivers to improve interference cancellation and suppression efficiency. The results show that such approach for parameter estimation provides performance for non-linear interference cancellation and suppression receivers close to the ideal system where interfering signal parameters are perfectly known.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Parameter estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Covariance matrices","Interference cancellation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","parameter estimation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","signal processing","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","non-linear receivers","turbo decoding","minimum mean squared error interference rejection combining","blind detection","symbol-level interference cancellation","maximum likelihood","long-term evolution advanced systems","signal processing problems","LTE-advanced systems","suppression receivers","decoding-aided parameter estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145770","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding-Aided Parameter Estimation for Interference Cancellation and Suppression Receivers in LTE-Advanced Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding-Aided Parameter Estimation for Interference Cancellation and Suppression Receivers in LTE-Advanced Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145770/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145770/","accessionNumber":"15288068","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding-Aided Parameter Estimation for Interference Cancellation and Suppression Receivers in LTE-Advanced Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060899S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7145773,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Mo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Mo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085404144"},{"name":"Changdon In","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Changdon","lastName":"In","id":"37085417146"},{"name":"Hyung-Myung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Myung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280363700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145773","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of detecting the pilot contamination attack for multi-antenna secrecy systems.

By far, both channel estimation and channel feedback have been proposed for FDD massive MIMO by exploiting the sparsity of CSI, but they are usually separately discussed, which may impair the CSIT acquisition performance and lead to unnecessary complex computation for users. In this paper, we propose the structured-CS based differential CSIT acquisition scheme for massive MIMO systems, where the downlink channel training and uplink channel feedback are jointly considered. Specifically, we first exploit the temporal correlation of time- varying channels to propose the differential CSIT acquisition scheme, which can reduce both the overhead for downlink training and uplink feedback. Then, we propose the structured compressive sampling matching pursuit (S-CoSaMP) algorithm to further reduce overhead by leveraging the structured sparsity of wireless MIMO channels. Moreover, the proposed differential operation and S-CoSaMP can also be used at users for better channel estimation performance if channel state information at the receiver is needed. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve better CSIT acquisition performance than its counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145776","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145776.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential CSIT Acquisition Based on Compressive Sensing for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145776/","displayDocTitle":"Differential CSIT Acquisition Based on Compressive Sensing for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288273","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145776/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential CSIT Acquisition Based on Compressive Sensing for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081286S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145777,"authors":[{"name":"Sangil Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangil","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085516363"},{"name":"Minhyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Minhyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085466161"},{"name":"Youngwook Sirl","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngwook","lastName":"Sirl","id":"37085501637"},{"name":"Eui-Rim Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Information And Communication, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Eui-Rim","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37325509000"},{"name":"Soonil Hong","affiliation":["Department of Information And Communication, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Soonil","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085508848"},{"name":"Seongjin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seongjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085523556"},{"name":"Yong H.

For a multiuser active antenna system, beamforming designs to maximize the weighted sum rate are proposed by optimizing the transmit antenna gain and power allocation. Since finding joint optimal parameters requires prohibitively high computational complexity, we separate the optimization problem into two sub-problems of the vertical beamforming and the power allocation. Then a simple vertical beamforming algorithm based on a high signal-to-noise ratio assumption is presented. Also, for a multi-user passive antenna system, we provide a beamforming scheme which employs a multi-sector concept.

In fact, to deal with the collision problem, successive interference cancellation is performed at the receiver. Generally, it is assumed that the receiver has perfect knowledge of the interference. In practice, the interference term is affected by the transmission channel parameters, i.e., channel attenuation, timing offsets, frequency offsets and phase shifts, and needs to be accurately estimated and canceled to avoid performance degradation. In this paper, we study the performance of an enhanced channel estimation technique combining estimation using an autocorrelation based method and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm integrated in a joint estimation and decoding scheme. We evaluate the effect of residual estimation errors after successive interference cancellation. To validate our experimental results, we compare them to the Cramer-Rao lower bounds for the estimation of channel parameters in case of superimposed signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145797.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Residual Channel Estimation Errors in Random Access Methods for Satellite Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Timing","Estimation error","Joints","Training","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","network coding","optimisation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed signals","expectation-maximization algorithm","enhanced channel estimation technique","transmission channel parameters","successive interference cancellation","satellite communications","random access methods","residual channel estimation errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Residual Channel Estimation Errors in Random Access Methods for Satellite Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287997","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Residual Channel Estimation Errors in Random Access Methods for Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048309S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145798,"authors":[{"name":"Antonino Orsino","affiliation":["DIIES Dep., University Mediterranea of Reggio, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonino","lastName":"Orsino","id":"37073355700"},{"name":"Giuseppe Araniti","affiliation":["DIIES Dep., University Mediterranea of Reggio, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Araniti","id":"37396983800"},{"name":"Antonella Molinaro","affiliation":["DIIES Dep., University Mediterranea of Reggio, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonella","lastName":"Molinaro","id":"37268951900"},{"name":"Antonio Iera","affiliation":["DIIES Dep., University Mediterranea of Reggio, Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Iera","id":"38509375800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145798","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"abstract":"Dense Networks (DenseNet) and Multi-Radio Access Technologies (Multi-RATs) are considered as key features of the emerging fifth generation (5G) wireless systems. A Multi- RAT DenseNet is characterized by a very dense deployment of low- power base stations (BSs) and by a multi-tier architecture consisting of heterogeneous radio access technologies. In this work, we propose an effective RAT selection algorithm that efficiently manages the RAT handover procedure by (i) choosing the most suitable RAT that guarantees high system and user performance, and (ii) reducing unnecessary handover events. In particular, the decision to trigger a handover is based on a new system parameter named Reference Base Station Efficiency (RBSE). This parameter takes into account metrics related to both the system and the user: the BS transmitted power, the BS traffic load and the users' spectral efficiency. We compare, by simulation, the proposed scheme with the standardized 3GPP policies. Results show that the proposed RAT selection scheme significantly reduces the number of handovers and the end-to- end delay while maintaining high system throughput and user spectral efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Interference","Base stations","Delays","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective RAT selection approach","5G dense wireless networks","dense networks","DenseNet","multiradio access technologies","Multi-RAT","5G wireless systems","multi-RAT DenseNet","low power base stations","BS","multitier architecture","radio access technologies","reference base station efficiency","RBSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145798","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145798.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective RAT Selection Approach for 5G Dense Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effective RAT Selection Approach for 5G Dense Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145798/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145798/","accessionNumber":"15287820","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective RAT Selection Approach for 5G Dense Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057168S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7145799,"authors":[{"name":"Jose-Ramon Perez-Cisneros","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Ramon","lastName":"Perez-Cisneros","id":"37085341969"},{"name":"Jesus de Mingo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"de Mingo","id":"37284816600"},{"name":"Pedro L.

Consequently, instead of separately focusing on either SE or EE, characterizing the fundamental trade-off between EE and SE of MIMO broadcast channels (BC) is significant for the development of green wireless communications. This paper investigates the fundamental EE-SE relationship in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel, which is important for facilitating a desirable balance between energy savings and spectrum utilization. Through our investigation, we prove that EE-SE relationship for MIMO-BC is a quasiconcave function. Furthermore, EE is proved to be either strictly decreasing with SE or first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing with SE. Based on these findings, we propose a two-layer resource allocation algorithm in order to tackle the comprehensive EE-SE trade-offs problem. The key of the proposed method lies in the inner-layer algorithm which is solved by applying the principle of multiple access channel - broadcast channel (MAC-BC) duality. The algorithm in its dual form is solved using sub-gradient method and bisection searching scheme. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm can efficiently approach the optimal EE-SE trade-off for MIMO-BC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency and Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in MIMO Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Wireless communication","Resource management","Power demand","Covariance matrices","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","duality (mathematics)","gradient methods","MIMO communication","resource allocation","search problems","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bisection searching scheme","sub-gradient method","MAC-BC duality","multiple access channel -broadcast channel duality","inner-layer algorithm","comprehensive EE-SE trade-offs problem","two-layer resource allocation algorithm","quasiconcave function","spectrum utilization","energy savings","multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel","green wireless communications","MIMO broadcast channels","green radio networks","performance metrics","energy efficiency","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency and Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in MIMO Broadcast Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145804/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288189","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency and Spectral Efficiency Trade-Off in MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078983S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145806,"authors":[{"name":"Xinxin Shi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xinxin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085347948"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Xuemei Zhou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085340899"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085365283"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145806","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Power demand","Cognitive radio","OFDM","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency optimization","OFDM","cognitive radio systems","wireless communication systems","nonlinear effect","Doherty power amplifier","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","power 80 W"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communication systems has become a hot issue, yet the nonlinear effect and inefficiency of power amplifier (PA) have posed practical challenges for system designs to achieve high EE.

The aim is to maximize EE with nonlinear PA subject to the total power budget, the interference constraint and the minimum rate requirement. Other than traditional methods, the problem is hard to solve directly due to the nonlinearity of PA, and a bisection search method tailored for nonlinear PA is adopted to achieve the sub-optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that if the PA's nonlinearity is not considered, the EE performance of OFDM-based CR systems can be severely overestimated by 34% at P max out = 80 W for 1-way Doherty PA. Meanwhile, the EE performance can be enhanced by approximate 32% if 2-way Doherty PA is utilized instead of 1-way Doherty PA.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145806","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145806.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: Impact of Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: Impact of Power Amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145806/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288304","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: Impact of Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045174S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145808,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Cheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085387322"},{"name":"Yuehong Gao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuehong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37404898900"},{"name":"Jinxi Fu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinxi","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085453549"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Zaixue Wei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zaixue","lastName":"Wei","id":"37873862100"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145808","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"abstract":"Ultra-dense Small Cell deployment is a sensible design of heterogeneous network, which provides a good performance of hot spots coverage enhancement and traffic load balancing. The growing energy consumption pressure becomes one of the main challenges of the Small Cell application. Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) can promise significant energy consumption savings for Small Cells via the separation between RRH and BBU. In this paper, we propose a novel software defined C-RAN (SDC-RAN) architecture in Small Cell network. Moreover, a self-adaptive power adjustment scheme (SA-PAS) is introduced, considering the influence of users' current and history traffic demands during downlink power allocation. The goals are to strike a good balance between energy efficiency and user experience. Simulation results show that the expected system throughput can be achieved with limited resource consumption in SDC-RAN based on Small Cell deployment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Energy efficiency","Radio access networks","Energy consumption","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cloud computing","energy conservation","energy consumption","radio access networks","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient control","software defined cloud radio access network","ultra-dense small cell deployment","heterogeneous network","hot spots coverage enhancement","traffic load balancing","energy consumption savings","RRH","BBU","self-adaptive power adjustment scheme","downlink power allocation","energy efficiency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145808","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145808.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Control for Software Defined Cloud Radio Access Network Based on Small Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Control for Software Defined Cloud Radio Access Network Based on Small Cell","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145808/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145808/","accessionNumber":"15288352","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Control for Software Defined Cloud Radio Access Network Based on Small Cell","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076498S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7145809,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Yang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38265733300"},{"name":"Thomas L.

In this system, the secondary receiver (SR) can extract power from the cyclic prefix (CP) of the received signal and use the harvested energy for its own energy supply. Our objective is to find the optimal power allocation and CP size that maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary system, under the maximum primary user (PU) interference and the minimum harvested energy constraints. As the CP size will impact the interference constraints, the relationship between optimal power allocation and CP size is hard to be expressed by a function. In this paper, we solve the problem by two steps. First, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to achieve the optimal power allocation for the EE maximization problem with a certain CP size, and then find the optimal CP size through a full-search method. The influence caused by the CP size on power allocation is illustrated by simulations and numerical results prove CPPT can improve the system utilization greatly compared with traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145810","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation in OFDM-Based CRNs with Cyclic Prefix Power Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145810/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation in OFDM-Based CRNs with Cyclic Prefix Power Transfer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145810/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Power Allocation in OFDM-Based CRNs with Cyclic Prefix Power Transfer","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063919S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7145813,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"38667780900"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"},{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["University of Technology, Sydney"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085386171"},{"name":"Gengfa Fang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Australia"],"firstName":"Gengfa","lastName":"Fang","id":"37286480000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145813","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Implants","Optimization","Body area networks","Wireless sensor networks","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","body area networks","concave programming","prosthetics","quadratic programming","relay networks (telecommunication)","search problems","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","scatter search","SOP","sequential quadratic programming","nonconvex optimization problem","EE optimization problem","BAN coordinator","implant node","relay location based cooperative network model","relay location impact evaluation","UWB IBAN","energy efficiency optimization","UWB based implant body area networks","energy-efficient distributed beamforming problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145813","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145813.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Distributed Beamforming in UWB Based Implant Body Area Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a distributed beamforming problem to optimize energy efficiency (EE) in ultra-wideband (UWB) based implant body area networks (IBANs).

With the proposed model, the EE optimization problem is mathematically formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) combined with scatter search are applied to find the corresponding optimal solution.

During subcarriers allocation, the priority of users is adaptively determined by both overall EE and the ratio of users' EE to proportionality.

The SIPT-enabled SR turns the harmful interference from the PT into energy and uses it to prolong battery life. We assume that the ST and SR adopt orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and our goal is to find the optimal power allocation and power splitting ratio that maximize the energy efficiency of the secondary system. To settle this non-convex problem, we utilize the fractional programming to transform the objective function into the counterpart subtractive form and then take advantage of an approximation to turn the problem convex. After that, the equivalent convex problem is solved by an efficient iterative algorithm. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed method performs well and achieves a good tradeoff between energy efficiency and capacity of the secondary system, especially in high signal interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) regions.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145819","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Simultaneous Information and Power Transfer in OFDM-Based CRNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145819/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Simultaneous Information and Power Transfer in OFDM-Based CRNs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288079","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145819/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Simultaneous Information and Power Transfer in OFDM-Based CRNs","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044871S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145820,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Quan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jun-Quan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085537910"},{"name":"Jui-Hung Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jui-Hung","lastName":"Chu","id":"38194937700"},{"name":"Kai-Ten Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Ten","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289448000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145820","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Antennas","Power demand","Optimization","Sensors","Femtocell networks","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","energy conservation","femtocellular radio","optimisation","radio spectrum management","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient spectrum selection","resource allocation","downlink cognitive femtocell networks","femtocell access points","spectrum selection policy","energy-efficient joint resource block","power allocation scheme","energy efficiency optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"The adoption of femtocell networks is considered as a promising solution to resolve the poor received signal strength problem experienced by the user equipment (UE) located in the coverage hole or in indoor environment. The architecture of femtocell networks, which adopt cognitive radio (CR), centralized controlled by femtocell gateway (F-GW) is further proposed to enhance the system performance by accessing more licensed spectrums. However, more deployed femtocells lead to additional energy consumption and it has become a crucial challenge for mobile operators. In this paper, the spectrum selection with limited number of antennas (SSLNA) is proposed to derive the target spectrum with consideration of hardware limitation of both femtocell access points (FAPs) and UEs. Based on the spectrum selection policies, the energy-efficient joint resource block (RB) and power allocation (EJRPA) scheme is proposed to improve the system energy efficiency. To avoid large amount of communicational load and complex computation for both F-GW and FAPs, the energy efficiency optimization problem is transformed into a two-layer problem solved respectively by F- GW and FAPs when the EJRPA is adopted. Simulation results show that better system energy efficiency can be achieved by adopting the proposed schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Selection and Resource Allocation in Downlink Cognitive Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145820","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145820.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Selection and Resource Allocation in Downlink Cognitive Femtocell Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145820/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288031","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Selection and Resource Allocation in Downlink Cognitive Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107881S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145823,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Mach","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Mach","id":"37407853100"},{"name":"Zdenek Becvar","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Becvar","id":"37595063900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145823","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Interference","Cascading style sheets","Femtocells","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control mechanism","macrocell users","femtocell users","sensing overhead","EHCA","enhanced hybrid cognitive approach","secondary cellular operators","primary cellular operator","CSS","combined spectrum sharing","primary users protection","radio resources","FAP","femto access point","interference mitigation","cognitive capabilities"]}],"abstract":"The use of femtocells with cognitive capabilities is considered as a promising way for interference mitigation. The femto access point (FAP) accesses the spectrum either in overlay or underlay fashion. In the former case, the FAPs utilize only radio resources currently not occupied by the macrocell. In the latter case, the whole bandwidth may be used but power of the FAPs is restricted. Both spectrum sharing approaches can be coupled to make the protection of primary users (PUs) more efficient. The merging of both ways results in a combined spectrum sharing (CSS). Additional combination of underlay approach and the CSS is known as a hybrid cognitive approach (HCA). In the HCA, the FAPs access the spectrum of the primary cellular operator through the underlay approach while the bandwidth of secondary cellular operators can be accessed by means of the CSS. In this paper, we propose an enhanced hybrid cognitive approach (EHCA), which main objective is to decrease sensing overhead and increase performance of the femtocell users while macrocell users are only minimally negatively affected. The enhancement consists in extension of power control mechanism for femtocells. The simulation results indicate that the sensing overhead can be decreased by the EHCA up to 48% and femtocell users throughput increased by up to 13.5% while the performance of the macrocell users is degraded only negligibly (less than 1.3%) when compared to former HCA scheme.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145823","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145823.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of Hybrid Cognitive Approach for Femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145823/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of Hybrid Cognitive Approach for Femtocells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288203","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145823/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of Hybrid Cognitive Approach for Femtocells","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056661S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145824,"authors":[{"name":"Zeid Al-Husseiny","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zeid","lastName":"Al-Husseiny","id":"37085496721"},{"name":"Pal Frenger","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pal","lastName":"Frenger","id":"37348438200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145824","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Earth","Switches","Energy consumption","Power demand","Heuristic algorithms","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy conservation","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE network","antenna muting","dynamic psi-omni configuration","MIMO","transmit antenna psi-omni covering mode","earth energy efficiency evaluation framework","E3F","energy savings"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145824","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145824.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing LTE Energy Performance with Antenna Muting and Dynamic Psi-Omni Configuration","abstract":"In this paper we examine the energy and user performance that can be achieved by combining antenna muting and dynamic three-sector to psi- omni site reconfiguration.

Performance evaluations, in accordance with the EARTH energy efficiency evaluation framework (E3F), show that in a nationwide LTE network the largest energy savings with the proposed algorithm are found in rural environments. By applying dynamic antenna muting we achieve 24.9% energy savings compared to the reference case without antenna muting. And by combining dynamic psi-omni coverage together with antenna muting energy savings of 43.8% were achieved. In the evaluations of the latter case we experienced a drop in average user bitrate of 10.7% when both algorithms (antenna muting and dynamic sector-omni reconfiguration) were applied.

Several equalization algorithms have been proposed to compensate for this non-linear behaviour. The Echo State Network (ESN), an algorithm coming from the field of artificial neural networks, has also been proposed for this task but has never been compared to state-of-the-art equalizers for non-linear channel. The aim of this paper is to adapt the ESN to the satellite communication channel and to compare it to the baseband Volterra equalizer. We show that the ESN is able to reach the same performances as the Volterra equalizer, evaluated in terms of bit error rate, and has similar complexity. In addition, we propose a new training strategy for the ESN and the Volterra equalizer to improve their performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145827.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145827","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization of the Non-Linear Satellite Communication Channel with an Echo State Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145827/","displayDocTitle":"Equalization of the Non-Linear Satellite Communication Channel with an Echo State Network","htmlLink":"/document/7145827/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15288160","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization of the Non-Linear Satellite Communication Channel with an Echo State Network","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073442S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145831,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cheaito","affiliation":["IETR, INSA de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Cheaito","id":"37085388593"},{"name":"Matthieu Crussiere","affiliation":["IETR, INSA de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Crussiere","id":"37269848800"},{"name":"Yves Louet","affiliation":["IETR, SUPELEC, Cesson-S\u00e9vigne, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Louet","id":"37571400800"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Helard","affiliation":["IETR, INSA de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269844900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145831","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Predistortion","Approximation methods","Transmitters","Nonlinear distortion","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier signals","predistortion characteristics","transition factors","linearization process","EVM","error vector magnitude","linearization stage","transmitter","PAPR","peak-to-average power ratio","power amplifier","nonlinear distortions","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145831","abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems are extremely sensitive to nonlinear distortions brought by the Power Amplifier (PA) because of the inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal.

In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of inter-cell interference mitigation techniques in a real indoor office deployment with four cells, where each cell features one Access Point (AP) and one User Equipment (UE). In particular, we compare traditional Frequency Reuse Planning (FRP) with the recently proposed Maximum Rank Planning (MRP) technique, which relies on the degrees of freedom offered by the multi-antenna transceivers for suppressing a number of interfering streams. Different receiver types are also considered, namely Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) and the interference unaware Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC). Each node in our software defined radio (SDR) testbed features a 2 x 2 MIMO transceiver built with the USRP N200 hardware by Ettus Research. The experimental results in a fully loaded network reveal the capability of the MRP technique to achieve higher throughput performance than FRP for 90% of the cases when IRC receivers are used. Lower network loads lead to further performance improvements for MRP.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145835.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Verification of Interference Mitigation Techniques for 5G Small Cells","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145835","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Verification of Interference Mitigation Techniques for 5G Small Cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145835/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15288283","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145835/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Verification of Interference Mitigation Techniques for 5G Small Cells","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051386S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145839,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Kaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Kaya","id":"37357728300"},{"name":"Emin Tugcu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emin","lastName":"Tugcu","id":"38467418600"},{"name":"Ali Ozen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nuh Naci Yazgan University, Kayseri, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ozen","id":"37892140300"},{"name":"Andrew Robert Nix","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Electronics Eng., The University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew Robert","lastName":"Nix","id":"37276828100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145839","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","Blind equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Least squares approximations","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","channel estimation","convolution","decision feedback equalisers","matched filters","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast convergence algorithm","blind channel estimation","blind channel equalization","channel matched filter","CMF","decision feedback equalizer","DFE","inverse convolution operations","linear finite impulse response estimation filter","error function","blind training","auto-regression values","nonblind techniques"]}],"abstract":"A novel fast blind equalizer is obtained by using the direct calculations from a channel matched filter decision feedback equalizer (CMF-DFE).

Being a candidate waveform technology for 5G wireless systems, it combines the simplicity of OFDM with the advantages of FBMC. The FIR-filter, used in UFMC to filter a group of subcarriers, is a key design parameter to gain more robustness in relaxed synchronization conditions, i.e. timefrequency misalignment. It was shown in previous work that very significant SIR improvement can be achieved for UFMC by optimizing the FIR-filter, taking carrier frequency offset into account. In this paper, we optimize the FIR-filter design in UFMC by taking both carrier frequency and timing offset into account in an uplink multi-user FDMA scenario. From the simulation results, up to 3.6 dB SIR improvement can be achieved with the optimized FIR filter compared to UFMC with non-optimized Dolph-Chebyshev filter and 15.1 dB SIR gain against classical CP-OFDM system respectively, provided that the normalized carrier frequency and timing offset are uniformly distributed in the interval \u00b15%.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145842","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Optimization for Carrier-Frequency- and Timing-Offset in Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Filter Optimization for Carrier-Frequency- and Timing-Offset in Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145842/","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288239","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter Optimization for Carrier-Frequency- and Timing-Offset in Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059411S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145845,"authors":[{"name":"Liyan Su","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liyan","lastName":"Su","id":"37085480267"},{"name":"Chenyang Yang","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145845","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"abstract":"Pilot contamination leads to a dramatic performance loss in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

After simplifying the problem with a lower bound of average throughput, we obtain a low complexity suboptimal solution. By analyzing this solution, we show the relationship between the size of the CCR and the number of antennas at each base station.

The use of short frames has a direct impact on the physical layer, especially on the forward-error correction code (FEC) performance. In this article, lattice based codes are used to achieve an efficient joint decoding of the code and the modulation. The linear group structure of lattices makes it possible to design a decoder based on a sphere decoder. To improve the performance for lower spectral efficiencies, the decoder design takes into account the inevitable lattice shaping processing of the transmitter. With a small number of dimensions, the frame lengths are very short and well suited to MTC. A comparison in frame error rate is performed between the proposed lattice code and an LTE inspired baseline, designed upon the LTE turbo code. Simulation results show that for equivalent spectral efficiencies, a gain in frame length is obtained. This frame length reduction can be employed for increasing the number of users in a machine type communication system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145846","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145846.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frame Length Reduction for Massive-Machine Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Frame Length Reduction for Massive-Machine Communications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288309","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame Length Reduction for Massive-Machine Communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066202S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145847,"authors":[{"name":"Hirley Alves","affiliation":["Federal University of Technology - Paran\u00e1 (UTFPR), Curitiba, Brazil","Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Hirley","lastName":"Alves","id":"37721129600"},{"name":"Richard D.

In our analysis, two main scenarios are considered: in the first scenario, the link between the source and destination is seen as interference and, in the second one, it is seen as useful information. In both schemes, the effect of self-interference at the relay is taken into account. Accurate, closed- form expressions for the outage probability are derived for the general case, in which CCI and noise are assumed at both the relay and destination. The derived expressions allow for independent non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading. Based on these expressions, special cases (but, yet new) assuming CCI only at the relay and assuming CCI only at the destination are examined. It is shown that CCI at the relay is more harmful for the system performance than CCI at the destination.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145847.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying Systems Subject to Co-Channel Interference and Noise in Nakagami-m Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Noise measurement","Fading","Noise","High definition video","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","Nakagami channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","self-interference","Nakagami-m fading","co-channel interference","full-duplex relaying systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Relaying Systems Subject to Co-Channel Interference and Noise in Nakagami-m Fading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287894","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex Relaying Systems Subject to Co-Channel Interference and Noise in Nakagami-m Fading","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111133S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145849,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Taek Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Jin-Taek","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085407450"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145849","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","MIMO","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Switches","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BS","target base station","adaptive MIMO hard handover","downlink spectral efficiency","OFDM networks","QoS","quality of service","mobile network systems","cell edge performance","LTE-OFDM systems","gain analysis","adaptive MIMO semisoft handover"]}],"abstract":"Cell edge performance in the handover has been recently researched in the development of mobile network systems since it can cause the significant degradation of the quality of service (QoS).

In this paper, we analyze the semisoft handover combined with the adaptive MIMO mode switching scheme. The downlink spectral efficiency is studied for the adaptive MIMO semisoft handover compared to the adaptive MIMO hard handover. The simulation and numerical results for each handover of the cellular systems are computed to validate the effectiveness of adaptive MIMO semisoft handover in the femtocell networks.

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of full-duplex transceivers. In this paper, we address the radio resource allocation problem for full-duplex system. Due to the self-interference and inter-user interference, the problem is coupled between uplink and downlink channels, and can be formulated as joint uplink and downlink sum-rate maximization. As the problem is non-convex, an iterative algorithm is proposed based on game theory by modelling the problem as a noncooperative game between the uplink and downlink channels. The algorithm iteratively carries out optimal uplink and downlink resource allocation until a Nash equilibrium is achieved. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves fast convergence, and can significantly improve the full-duplex performance comparing to the equal resource allocation approach. Furthermore, the full-duplex system with the proposed algorithm can achieve considerable gains in spectral efficiency, that reach up to 40%, comparing to half-duplex system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145850.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theory Based Radio Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Uplink","Interference","Games","Wireless communication","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","game theory","iterative methods","multiplexing","radio links","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-duplex system","Nash equilibrium","optimal downlink resource allocation","optimal uplink resource allocation","noncooperative game","iterative algorithm","sum-rate maximization","downlink channels","uplink channels","interuser interference","self-interference","wireless system spectral efficiency","full-duplex transceivers","full-duplex systems","radio resource allocation","game theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Game Theory Based Radio Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287934","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theory Based Radio Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06212S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145851,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Nasiri Khormuji","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Sweden AB, Stockholm"],"firstName":"Majid Nasiri","lastName":"Khormuji","id":"37643215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145851","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Interference","Protocols","Uplink","Blanking","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","protocols","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource-offset sequence","mutually orthogonal pilot sequences","time-division duplex protocol","massive MIMO","generalized semi-orthogonal multiple-access"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel framework to enable concurrent transmission of multiple users to an access node equipped with a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO), which encompasses and extends the conventional time-division duplex (TDD) protocol and the recently proposed semi-orthogonal multiple-access (SOMA).

To enable GSOMA, the users are grouped such that the users within each group are assigned mutually orthogonal pilot sequences.

A possible intermediary solution between using the optimal but complex SIC decoder and the simple but poor performing MMSE decoder, is to consider different group decoders, namely, group SIC (GSIC) and group parallel decoding (GPD). The performances of such decoders strongly depend on the grouping strategy. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to handle different group decoders. We use tools from random matrix theory to present a tight approximation of the average sum rate achieved in the case of adopting any kind of these decoders using only statistical CSI. For large number of data streams and fast changing channels, finding the optimal grouping for each channel realization is very complex. We formulate an optimization problem in which we use our developed approximations to find a static grouping which is shown to lead to a performance near to the optimal SIC and much better than the MMSE, especially for high transmit correlation. We also show how the performance depends on different system parameters, such as correlation strength and number of groups.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145853.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Decoders for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems: The Use of Random Matrix Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Silicon carbide","Approximation methods","Correlation","MIMO","Receivers","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","MIMO communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group decoders","correlated massive MIMO systems","random matrix theory","group parallel decoding","unified framework","average sum rate","optimization problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Group Decoders for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems: The Use of Random Matrix Theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145853/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287902","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Decoders for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems: The Use of Random Matrix Theory","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045909S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145855,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Fang","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085488227"},{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Makki","id":"37289967200"},{"name":"Yateng Hong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yateng","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085391375"},{"name":"Xiaodong Xu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37290503400"},{"name":"Tommy Svensson","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tommy","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37294450000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145855","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) plays an important role in improving the transmission efficiency and the robustness of wireless networks.

To overcome this, spatial multiplexing and beamforming can be employed and in mmWave due to the small wavelength, large antenna arrays can be used to provide the required gain. However, unlike the traditional microwave systems it is not feasible to afford one RF chain per antenna. To overcome this practical limitation, hybrid beamforming can be utilized and the complexity of the transceiver can be reduced by implementing the RF domain processing using only the analog phase shifters. In this paper, we propose a two step approach to design a hybrid beamforming architecture. In this approach, we first design the baseband beamforming and then the RF domain beamforming is realized using an iterative algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by providing numerical examples by means of simulation.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145861","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145861.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145861","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming under Equal Gain Constraint for Maximizing Sum Rate at 60 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming under Equal Gain Constraint for Maximizing Sum Rate at 60 GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145861/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288376","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Beamforming under Equal Gain Constraint for Maximizing Sum Rate at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075879S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7145863,"authors":[{"name":"Dushyantha A.

A hybrid system with multiple VLC access points (APs) and RF APs is designed and compared. In indoor environments, VLC APs can provide very high data rates whilst satisfying illumination requirements, and RF APs can offer ubiquitous coverage. Even though very high throughput is supported by VLC APs, such coverage area may be spatially limited. This gives an opportunity to introduce a new small cell layer to current heterogeneous wireless networks, and it is referred as optical attocellular layer. However since VLC piggy-backs on the existing lighting infrastructure, it may not be possible to achieve full coverage. Hence in practical deployments, the spatial throughput distribution of standalone VLC systems should be augmented. In this context, RF APs can be used to improve the overall rate performance of the heterogeneous wireless system. In this study, the focus is on improving the per user average and outage throughput. It is assumed that the VLC system resources are fixed, and the study quantifies the spectrum and power requirements for a RF system, which after introduction to the VLC system, achieves better per user rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145863","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145863.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid RF and VLC Systems: Improving User Data Rate Performance of VLC Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid RF and VLC Systems: Improving User Data Rate Performance of VLC Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145863/","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288248","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid RF and VLC Systems: Improving User Data Rate Performance of VLC Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093812S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145864,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Bassoli","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, Surrey, UK","Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Bassoli","id":"37072763200"},{"name":"Vahid N.

When a large number of femtocells are overlapped, serious femto-femto interference becomes one of the major technical challenges. In this paper, we propose an inter-cell interference coordination scheme based on Quality of Service (QoS) hypergraph coloring algorithm.The hypergraph is used to model the cumulative interference relationships between femtocells, so as to mitigate interference more accurately. Taking into account the different QoS demand and greedy hypergraph coloring algorithm, all the femtocells are divided into different clusters, each of which has the maximum sum throughput. An effective resource allocation strategy is then gained by solving the optimisation problem of multi-user subchannels allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could enhance the user throughput and average throughput.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145865","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145865.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Intercell Interference Coordination for QoS Guarantees in Dense Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145865/","displayDocTitle":"Hypergraph-Based Intercell Interference Coordination for QoS Guarantees in Dense Femtocell Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288040","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145865/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hypergraph-Based Intercell Interference Coordination for QoS Guarantees in Dense Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057083S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145881,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Networks, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716001800"},{"name":"Claudio Rosa","affiliation":["Nokia Networks, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Rosa","id":"37294529900"},{"name":"Klaus I.

In this paper we focus on the case where the macro and small cell eNBs are inter-connected with traditional backhaul connections characterized by certain latency, assuming independent radio resource management (RRM) functionalities residing in each eNB. In order to fully harvest the gain provided by DC, an efficient flow control of data between the involved macro and small cell eNBs is proposed. It is demonstrated how proper configuration of the proposed flow control algorithm offers trade-offs between reducing the probability that one of the eNBs involved in the DC runs out of data and limiting the buffering time in the corresponding eNB.

From simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide the better sum rate performance under the same system configurations than the existing schemes which mitigate the interference leakage by aligning the ICI channels under limited feedback.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145882","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Limited Feedback for Two-Cell Interfering MIMO-MAC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Limited Feedback for Two-Cell Interfering MIMO-MAC","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145882/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288367","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145882/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Limited Feedback for Two-Cell Interfering MIMO-MAC","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07738S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145883,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Rihan","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Communications, and Computing, Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST), New Borg Elarab Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Rihan","id":"37085467901"},{"name":"Maha Elsabrouty","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Communications, and Computing, Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST), New Borg Elarab Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Elsabrouty","id":"37297463000"},{"name":"Osamu Muta","affiliation":["Center for Japan-Egypt Cooperation in Science and Technology, Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Muta","id":"37293729800"},{"name":"Hiroshi Furukawa","affiliation":["Center for Japan-Egypt Cooperation in Science and Technology, Kyushu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Furukawa","id":"37342224700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145883","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Upper bound","Quantization (signal)","Closed-form solutions","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","femtocellular radio","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","macrocell-femtocell heterogeneous networks","channel state information at transmitters","CSIT","limited feedback-based IA scheme","heterogeneous networks"]}],"abstract":"Interference alignment (IA) emerged on the communication scene as a solution to the interference problem in all interference-limited networks, including heterogeneous cellular systems. However, the performance of IA is greatly related to the accuracy of the channel state information at transmitters (CSIT), namely the number of feedback bits. Accordingly, in order to improve the performance of IA, it would be useful to analyze the number of feedback bits with respect to the sum rate loss. Motivated by that, this paper studies a limited feedback-based IA scheme suitable for two tier macrocell-femtocell heterogeneous networks. First, an approximate analytical expression for the upper bound on the total sum rate loss due to limited feedback in the studied IA system, is derived. Then, a simulation based evaluation of the sum-rate loss due to the implementation of limited feedback IA in heterogeneous networks is obtained. Simulation results confirmed the severe effect of quantization of CSI on the interference alignment performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment with Limited Feedback for Macrocell-Femtocell Heterogeneous Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145883","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145883.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment with Limited Feedback for Macrocell-Femtocell Heterogeneous Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145883/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287814","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment with Limited Feedback for Macrocell-Femtocell Heterogeneous Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066411S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7145887,"authors":[{"name":"Ain-ul-Aisha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Ain-ul-Aisha","id":"37085531597"},{"name":"Nikita Mayekar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikita","lastName":"Mayekar","id":"37085532366"},{"name":"Alexander M.

The features of proposed method are to employ a time domain training sequence (TS) in the estimation of channel impulse response (CIR) instead of using pilot subcarriers in the frequency domain and to employ a time domain equalization (TDE) method with a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation instead of using a conventional frequency domain equalization (FDE) method. This paper also proposes a low-complexity iterative method for solving the simultaneous equations in the MLD method instead of using an inverse matrix calculation.

In order to resolve the virtual symbol into the two original symbols, extrinsic log likelihood ratio (LLR), which is fed back from the channel decoder, is exploited with the aid of iterative decoding. For the sake of improving the convergence property of iterative decoding, sparse pilot symbols are doped in a stream of transmitted symbols.

The obtained results have shown significant improvements in terms of energy efficiency and bit error rate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145894","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145894.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Equalization for General QAM Constellations with Reduced Envelope Fluctuations through Magnitude Modulation Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Equalization for General QAM Constellations with Reduced Envelope Fluctuations through Magnitude Modulation Techniques","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145894/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288256","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145894/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Frequency-Domain Equalization for General QAM Constellations with Reduced Envelope Fluctuations through Magnitude Modulation Techniques","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072296S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7145900,"authors":[{"name":"Nur Oyku Tuncel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nur Oyku","lastName":"Tuncel","id":"37085453444"},{"name":"Mutlu Koca","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mutlu","lastName":"Koca","id":"37296264100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145900","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Bandwidth","Joints","Load management","Indexes","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell edge spectral efficiency","frequency planing schemes","FFR","fractional frequency reuse","self-organizing OFDMA networks","ICI","intercell interference coordination","MLB algorithm","mobility load balancing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We consider the joint load imbalance and inter-cell interference (ICI) problems and propose a novel mobility load balancing (MLB) algorithm that is compatible with the well-known ICI coordination (ICIC) approaches relying on fractional frequency reuse (FFR).

The use of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) is effective to remove the inter-user interference (IUI). To remove the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the channel frequency-selectivity, transmit equalization (TE) can be introduced. In the Degen and Rr\u00fchl's SC-MU-MIMO scheme (called as FD-SC-TETHP in this paper), THP and TE are performed separately in the frequency-domain. The modulo operation in THP suppresses the power increase caused by the IUI removal. TE can remove the ISI and the amplitude variation in the signals of a block received at each user, though it increases the signal power after equalization. This degrades significantly the received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a time-domain SC-TETHP (TD-SC-TETHP), in which the ISI subtraction is performed together with IUI subtraction both in the time-domain. The modulo operation suppresses the power increase caused by both IUI and ISI removal. To prevent the amplitude variation, pre-removal of the received signal amplitude variation is inserted between the modulo operation and the precoding matrix multiplication. Uncoded average bit error rate (BER) performance achievable by our proposed TD-SC-TETHP is evaluated by computer simulation to confirm its superiority to the FD-SC-TETHP. Computational complexity is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145906","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145906.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding and Transmit Equalization in Time-Domain for Single-Carrier MU-MIMO Block Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145906/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding and Transmit Equalization in Time-Domain for Single-Carrier MU-MIMO Block Transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288033","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145906/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding and Transmit Equalization in Time-Domain for Single-Carrier MU-MIMO Block Transmission","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04777S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145908,"authors":[{"name":"Maurice Bellanger","affiliation":["CNAM, Paris cedex 03, France"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Bellanger","id":"37284922400"},{"name":"Davide Mattera","affiliation":["Dpt.

The proposed approach, based on the so-called lapped transform, combines a simple yet efficient perfect reconstruction real filter bank with QAM modulation. Real processing of the real and imaginary components of the QAM data samples introduces a symmetry of the used carriers and the spectrum of the multicarrier signal can be either continuous or fragmented. Implementing the receiver with an extended FFT allows for frequency domain channel equalization and the performance achieved is sufficient to avoid the need for a cyclic prefix. The scheme is appropriate for asynchronous access and the filter provides a high level of spectral protection, as required by users in cognitive radio scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145908","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145908.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lapped-OFDM as an Alternative to CP-OFDM For 5G Asynchronous Access and Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Lapped-OFDM as an Alternative to CP-OFDM For 5G Asynchronous Access and Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145908/","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287950","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145908/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lapped-OFDM as an Alternative to CP-OFDM For 5G Asynchronous Access and Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04644S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145910,"authors":[{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279547400"},{"name":"Zhenling Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Zhenling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085550651"},{"name":"Yuqi Huang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Yuqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085411977"},{"name":"Hao Wei","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085425956"},{"name":"Xiangyang Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407477600"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37085545995"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145910","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"abstract":"In this paper, we study the large-scale multi-user distributed antenna system (DAS) for hot-spot coverage in the future 5G wireless network.

In our evaluations, for the case of a 1-by-2 transmission and the number of NOMA multiplexed users is two, we clarify the performance of NOMA for cell-center user equipment (UE) with codeword level SIC (CWIC) receiver and the performance of the cell-edge UE, which does not apply SIC. Based on link-level performance evaluations, we show that the performance of CWIC receiver is almost the same as that of ideal SIC when the allocated transmit power ratio to cell-center UE is less than 0.35, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of cell-center UE is 16QAM (R = 0.51) or 64QAM (R = 0.47), and the MCS of cell-edge UE is QPSK (R = 0.51). Furthermore, we also show that, when EVM value is 4 % and the allocated power ratio to cell-center UE is between 0.2 and 0.37, the level of degradation due to the influence of EVM is below 0.6 dB, which is almost the same level of degradation as that of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for the EVM value required by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE). On the other hand, we show that the influence of EVM is marginal for cell-edge UE compared to cell-center UE. However, when the cell-center UE uses a higher order modulation such as 64QAM, we show that the required SNR of cell-edge UE increases due to the increase in inter-user interference. Based on these results, we clarify that it is important for the base station (BS) to take into account the target BLER and influence of EVM when selecting the MCS and allocated transmit power ratio of NOMA UEs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-Level Performance of Downlink NOMA with SIC Receiver Considering Error Vector Magnitude","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145913","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Link-Level Performance of Downlink NOMA with SIC Receiver Considering Error Vector Magnitude","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145913/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288347","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-Level Performance of Downlink NOMA with SIC Receiver Considering Error Vector Magnitude","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100711S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145914,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Yu Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chia-Yu","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37085556876"},{"name":"David W.

This paper, which is put in the latter, utilizes load-modulated arrays with only reactance loads for single-RF transmission of spatially multiplexed QAM signals. To alleviate the need for iterative processes while considering mutual coupling in the compact antenna, we present a novel design methodology for the loading network, which enables the exact computation of the three reactance loads per antenna element and also the perfect matching to the source with the opportunity to select appropriate analog tunable loads. We verify the design methodology by comparing the calculated values for some key parameters with the values from the circuit simulation. In addition, as an evaluation of the proposed architecture, we perform the bit error rate (BER) comparison which shows that our scheme with ideal loading is comparable to the conventional MIMO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Modulated Single-RF MIMO Transmission for Spatially Multiplexed QAM Signals","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145915","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145915.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Load-Modulated Single-RF MIMO Transmission for Spatially Multiplexed QAM Signals","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145915/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287826","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Modulated Single-RF MIMO Transmission for Spatially Multiplexed QAM Signals","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063329S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145916,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyao Wang","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Dongyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085413863"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406077300"},{"name":"Yinan Qi","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Qi","id":"37598671700"},{"name":"Atta Ul Quddus","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Atta Ul","lastName":"Quddus","id":"37266414400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145916","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Handover","Mobile radio mobility management","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","software defined networking","synchronisation","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localized mobility management","software defined network","SDN","small cell","SCell network","telecommunication networks","Long Term Evolution","LTE mobile backhaul network","IEEE 802.1ad double tagging scheme","traffic forwarding","serving gateway","S-GW","quality of service","QoS","dynamic localized forwarding scheme","packet delivery","traffic session","path-switch signalling cost","path switch policy","forwarding path deletion","data delivery","delivery cost","forwarding chain","backhaul latency"]}],"abstract":"Small cell (SCell) and Software Define Network (SDN) are two key enablers to meet the evolutional requirements of future telecommunication networks, but still on the initial study stage with lots of challenges faced. In this paper, the problem of mobility management in SDN-integrated LTE (Long Term Evolution) mobile backhaul network is investigated. An 802.1ad double tagging scheme is designed for traffic forwarding between Serving Gateway (S-GW) and SCell with QoS (Quality of Service) differentiation support. In addition, a dynamic localized forwarding scheme is proposed for packet delivery of the ongoing traffic session to facilitate the mobility of UE within a dense SCell network. With this proposal, the data packets of an ongoing session can be forwarded from the source SCell to the target SCell instead of switching the whole forwarding path, which can drastically save the path-switch signalling cost in this SDN network. Numerical results show that compared with traditional path switch policy, more than 50% signalling cost can be reduced, even considering the impact on the forwarding path deletion when session ceases. The performance of data delivery is also analysed, which demonstrates the introduced extra delivery cost is acceptable and even negligible in case of short forwarding chain or large backhaul latency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145916.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized Mobility Management for SDN-Integrated LTE Backhaul Networks","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145916","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Localized Mobility Management for SDN-Integrated LTE Backhaul Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145916/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287991","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145916/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized Mobility Management for SDN-Integrated LTE Backhaul Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063387S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145919,"authors":[{"name":"Ailing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

However, with the development of 3D MIMO technique, there are increasing number antenna ports in a limited space. The pilot overhead in 3D PACE method which increase linearly with the antenna number becomes unacceptable. Since compressed sensing (CS) technique ignoring the theoretic upper limit in the pilot spacing derived by the sampling theorem has been successfully applied to pilot aided 2D sparse channel estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we introduce the CS technique to 3D pilot aided channel estimation to reduce pilot overhead in 3D MIMO systems. Moreover, a random search method based non-uniform pilot allocation algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to further improve the CS performance. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the traditional evenly pilot for 3D PACE, our proposed non-uniform pilot for CS-based channel estimation its average gain can improves about 3.58dB with the same pilot overhead. The result also shows that by employing the CS-based channel estimation, pilot overhead can be sharply reduced without estimation accuracy loss.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145919","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Compressed Sensing Based Channel Estimation in 3D MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Compressed Sensing Based Channel Estimation in 3D MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287883","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Compressed Sensing Based Channel Estimation in 3D MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078131S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145920,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Indoor positioning becomes a popular issue for location- based services used in shopping malls, hospitals, or largescale buildings. Contrast with spacious surroundings of outdoor, indoor environment is filled with obstacles and moving people, which impose great challenges to provide precise estimation of indoor positioning. This paper proposes Wi-Fi fingerprinting technique using received signal strength with consideration of map information to effectively eliminate unreasonable estimation outcomes. The proposed area estimation (AE) algorithms calculate the similarity of each area in the entire region to increase accuracy of distinguishing which area the user locates. Moreover, the shortest path with adjacent recognition (SPAR) algorithm further utilizes the concept of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the previous location information to predict user's position. Experimental results show that the proposed AE with SPAR algorithms can provide better area estimation compared to conventional scheme.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145926","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Map-Aware Indoor Area Estimation with Shortest Path Based on RSS Fingerprinting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Map-Aware Indoor Area Estimation with Shortest Path Based on RSS Fingerprinting","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145926/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288039","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145926/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Map-Aware Indoor Area Estimation with Shortest Path Based on RSS Fingerprinting","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068432S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145928,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled M.

The performance of the receiver is analyzed for an indoor visible light communications system where LED lights are used as data transmitters. It is shown that the MIMO channel matrix has full rank for typical receiver positions and that for a given number of PDs, the new receiver provides much greater diversity than a conventional receiver of the same overall dimensions in which all of the PDs have the same FOV. Finally the overall bit error rate (BER) is presented for systems using asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) as the modulation scheme. Results are presented for both zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in the receiver. It is shown that the BER varies with receiver position, with relatively high values in the center and the corners of the room.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology

pilot contamination (PC) unless appropriate PC mitigation or avoidance schemes are employed. In this paper we develop techniques based on existing long term evolution (LTE) measurements - open loop power control (OLPC) and pilot sequence reuse schemes, that avoid PC within a group of cells. We compare the performance of simple least-squares channel estimator with the higher-complexity minimum mean square error estimator, and evaluate the performance of the recently proposed coordinated pilot allocation (CPA) technique (which is appropriate in cooperative systems). The performance measures of interest include the normalized mean square error of channel estimation, the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise and spectral efficiency when employing maximum ratio transmission or zero forcing precoding at the base station. We find that for terminals moving at vehicular speeds, PC can be effectively mitigated in an operation and maintenance node using both the OLPC and the pilot reuse schemes. Additionally, greedy CPA provides performance gains only for a fraction of terminals, at the cost of degradation for the rest of the terminals and higher complexity. These results indicate that in practice, PC may be effectively mitigated without the need for second-order channel statistics or inter-cell cooperation.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145932","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145932.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating Pilot Contamination by Pilot Reuse and Power Control Schemes for Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145932/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating Pilot Contamination by Pilot Reuse and Power Control Schemes for Massive MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288315","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145932/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating Pilot Contamination by Pilot Reuse and Power Control Schemes for Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053307S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145934,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Zhao","affiliation":["Network Technology, SONY Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden","Department of Electromagnetic Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38503528800"},{"name":"Jakob Helander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","Network Technology, SONY Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Helander","id":"37085388407"},{"name":"Zhinong Ying","affiliation":["Network Technology, SONY Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhinong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37305489700"},{"name":"Daniel Sjoberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sjoberg","id":"37310304200"},{"name":"Mats Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37307263000"},{"name":"Sailing He","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sailing","lastName":"He","id":"37085383875"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145934","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Mobile communication","Mobile antennas","Antenna arrays","Thumb","Skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","millimetre wave antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mmWave phased array","mobile terminal","5G mobile system","hand effect","frequency 15 GHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the latest study of the millimeter wave (mmWave) phased array in mobile terminals for the 5G communication is presented.

However, such a system is quite vulnerable to co-channel interference, due to presence of multiple users in the system. Signal detection becomes highly challenging when number of transmit antennas exceeds the number of receive antennas,thereby creating an over-loaded wireless system. In this case, Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection offers optimal performance as compared to suboptimal methods. However, ML detection is prohibitively complex especially once the number of transmit antenna increase. This work proposes a receiver architecture tohandle multi user overloaded systems using a combination of Network Coding (NC) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) protocol to transform an overloaded system into a simplified co-channel system. An overloaded system is created using stacked HARQ retransmissions and NC techniques. This enables application of conventional low complexity detectors in such systems. Monte Carlo Simulations prove that the proposed approach results in significant gains in terms of Error Rates and throughput, while keeping the dropped packet rate quite low at an affordable complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Detection of Co-Channel Systems Using Combination of Basic Network Coding and HARQ","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145943","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145943.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection of Co-Channel Systems Using Combination of Basic Network Coding and HARQ","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145943/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288364","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection of Co-Channel Systems Using Combination of Basic Network Coding and HARQ","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058952S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145944,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Kai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yen-Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085461835"},{"name":"David W.

In a frequency-division duplex (FDD) system, the obtaining of CSIT requires receiver feedback, and various CSI compression and feedback methods have been proposed in the literature. The present work considers an LTE-like scenario where the transmitter uses implicit CSI fed back by the receivers to reconstruct the MIMO channel coefficients, where the implicit CSI includes preferred precoding matrices and channel quality indications. To solve for the channel coefficients from these implicit CSI quantities, however, requires multiple feedbacks computed using different sounding pilots. We describe the overall design of the proposed method, formulate the corresponding mathematical problem of CSIT estimation, and derive a solution to the problem considering both time-invariant and time-varying channels. And we present some numerical results to illustrate the performance of the method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User MIMO Channel Estimation with Multiple CSI Feedbacks in an LTE-Like Scenario","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145944","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145944.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User MIMO Channel Estimation with Multiple CSI Feedbacks in an LTE-Like Scenario","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145944/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288171","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User MIMO Channel Estimation with Multiple CSI Feedbacks in an LTE-Like Scenario","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056963S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145946,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Hoshino","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, Softbank Mobile Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Hoshino","id":"37710866700"},{"name":"Sho Nabatame","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, Softbank Mobile Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Sho","lastName":"Nabatame","id":"37990729000"},{"name":"Atsushi Nagate","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, Softbank Mobile Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Nagate","id":"37294615700"},{"name":"Teruya Fujii","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, Softbank Mobile Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruya","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37290596700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145946","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication","Base stations","Buildings","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coordinated intercell interference control","horizontal plane beamforming","small cellular network","3D cell structure","macrocellular deployment","network coordinated base station beamforming","horizontal plane beam control","beam coordination","network coordination"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coordinated Inter-Cell Interference Control Using Horizontal-Plane Beamforming on Small Cells in 3D Cell Structure","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145946","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145946","abstract":"3D cell structure, where small cells are three- dimensionally deployed on macro cells, is considered as one of the effective cell structures to accommodate data traffic growing rapidly in recent years.

Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes outperform the existing OIA scheme significantly in terms of both sum rate and BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145952","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Opportunistic Interference Alignment Schemes in MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Opportunistic Interference Alignment Schemes in MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145952/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288149","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145952/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Opportunistic Interference Alignment Schemes in MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1160166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058288S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145953,"authors":[{"name":"Mikio Iwamura","affiliation":["NGMN 5G Initiative Workstream Lead \u201cTechnology and Architecture\u201d, NGMN Alliance"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Iwamura","id":"37085504525"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4073},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Computer architecture","Mobile communication","Hardware","Context","Microprocessors","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G architecture design","5G radio access technology","network slicing","5G design principles","NGMN 5G whitepaper","socio-economic demands","fifth generation mobile technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145953","abstract":"The fifth generation of mobile technology (5G) will address the socio-economic demands and business contexts of 2020 and beyond.

The existing works have been widely researched on the CSI feedback problem for system throughput aspects. With limited available radio resources, system throughput and fairness are usually in conflict with each other, balancing system throughput and fairness with high resource efficiency is necessary. Also, the analysis of feedback-rate allocation considering these two performance measures is needed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game for improving throughput fairness in MU-MIMO system. Based on the game theory, the utility function of each user is considered both throughput fairness and total throughput. Moreover, we investigate the existence of the Nash-equilibrium of the proposed game and outage probability in terms of CSI feedback-rate. Simulation results show that the proposed game improves throughput fairness, and thus achieves better outage performance, as compared to the conventional equal-sized feedback scheme.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145954","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145954.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Cooperative Feedback Control Game for Improving Throughput Fairness in MIMO Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Cooperative Feedback Control Game for Improving Throughput Fairness in MIMO Broadcast Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145954/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287819","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Cooperative Feedback Control Game for Improving Throughput Fairness in MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053979S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145958,"authors":[{"name":"Ehab Salahat","affiliation":["Technology and Research, Khalifa University of Science, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Ehab","lastName":"Salahat","id":"37070010000"},{"name":"Hani Saleh","affiliation":["Technology and Research, Khalifa University of Science, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37391220900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145958","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","MIMO","Noise","Diversity reception","Error analysis","Performance analysis","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","orthogonal codes","radio networks","space-time block codes","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal space-time block codes","generalized-K networks","AWGGN MIMO networks","unified performance analysis","multiple input multiple output network","average bit error rate","coherent modulation","distributed generalized-K fading channels","multipath fading","shadowing efect","Nakagami-m distribution","gamma distributions","additive white generalized Gaussian noise"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel unified performance analysis of Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) operating in the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) network.

The noise model in the network is assumed to be an Additive White Generalized Gaussian Noise (AWGGN), which encompasses the Laplacian and the Gaussian noise environments as special cases. The derived expression obviates the need to recalculate the diversity of various receivers for many fading and noise models in a piecemeal fashion.

The derived lower bound is shown to be limited by three types of interferences: inter-cell interference, intra- cell interference and pilot contamination. A set of conditions including the number of users, antennas, pilot reuse factor and coherence period is analyzed for which the lower bound of throughput is achieved.

Rayleigh fading assumption with a very large number of base station antennas. However, it has been shown that at millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies, this assumption is not valid due to the limited number of multipath components and spatial channel correlation. In this paper, we examine the mutual orthogonality of a realistic 60-GHz outdoor propagation channel with practical large antenna arrays, and determine the factors deciding it based on the channel data generated by means of deterministic field prediction. The results obtained reveal relationships between mutual orthogonality, inter-user distance, number of active users, transmit array dimensions, and downlink system capacity at 60-GHz band, which are useful for designing future mmW massive MU-MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mutual Orthogonality of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145972","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145972.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Mutual Orthogonality of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145972/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288128","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mutual Orthogonality of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056526S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145977,"authors":[{"name":"Jaakko Vihriala","affiliation":["Nokia Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Vihriala","id":"37269214300"},{"name":"Natalia Ermolova","affiliation":["Nokia Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Natalia","lastName":"Ermolova","id":"37267434800"},{"name":"Eeva Lahetkangas","affiliation":["Nokia Networks, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Eeva","lastName":"Lahetkangas","id":"37947152500"},{"name":"Olav Tirkkonen","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Olav","lastName":"Tirkkonen","id":"37085369079"},{"name":"Kari Pajukoski","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Kari","lastName":"Pajukoski","id":"37269109300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145977","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":862},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145977","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Filter banks","MIMO","Time-frequency analysis","Complexity theory","Mobile communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","broadband networks","channel bank filters","energy conservation","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","radiofrequency power amplifiers","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear power amplifier","spectral properties","FBMC","5G MBB waveform","OFDM","filter bank multicarrier","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","cost efficiency","energy efficiency","air interface design","millimeter wave region","radio access performance","ubiquitous mobile broadband","5G mobile broadband communication"]}],"abstract":"To realize the vision of ubiquitous mobile broadband where radio access performance should not be a limiting factor for user experience, we need to access very large bandwidths, and thus consider higher frequency bands up to the millimeter wave region. Air interface design, including waveforms, is a very important component for the success of 5G mobile broadband (MBB) in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and cost efficiency. In this paper, we compare two waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and filter bank multicarrier (FBMC), in terms of these requirements. We show that OFDM is a suitable waveform for MBB due to reasonably low overhead, low cost and latency; whereas FBMC loses its spectral properties when non-linear power amplifier is used.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145977","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145977.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Waveforms for 5G Mobile Broadband Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Waveforms for 5G Mobile Broadband Communications","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145977/","accessionNumber":"15288099","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Waveforms for 5G Mobile Broadband Communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159720.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042544S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7145983,"authors":[{"name":"Yuefeng Li","affiliation":["NCL, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuefeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085447362"},{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["NCL, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085441130"},{"name":"Yu Gong","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical and Systems Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Gong","id":"37085448210"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145983","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145983","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Interference","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","network coding","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue network coding","relay link","direct link","relay nodes","source nodes","primary users","licensed spectrum bands","spectrum-underutilization problem","CR technology","cognitive radio networks","coordinated transmission","power allocation schemes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145983","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145983.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Coordinated Transmission in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology has been developed to solve the spectrum-underutilization problem. In CR networks, the CR users have opportunities to access the licensed spectrum bands assigned to the primary users (PUs). Since the PUs have priorities to use the bands, the CR users are not allowed to generate unacceptable interference to them. In this paper, we investigate power allocation schemes for source and relay nodes in CR with direct and relay link. We show that there is a significant benefit to the system rate by jointly distributing the transmitting power. Three schemes are considered, where particularly the scheme based on analogue network coding shows significant superior performance to other two classic schemes.

Moreover, the effects of shadowing on the performance of the system have been quantified and it has been shown that the shadowing does not average out by increasing the number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145990","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Analysis of Multi-User Massive MIMO Systems Subject to Composite Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage Analysis of Multi-User Massive MIMO Systems Subject to Composite Fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145990/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287807","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145990/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Analysis of Multi-User Massive MIMO Systems Subject to Composite Fading","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043465S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145994,"authors":[{"name":"Panca Dewi Pamungkasari","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Panca Dewi","lastName":"Pamungkasari","id":"37085448148"},{"name":"Yukitoshi Sanada","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukitoshi","lastName":"Sanada","id":"37269451300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145994","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145994","abstract":"In this paper, a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme without side information (SI) is propossed. Cyclic-selective mapping (cyclic-SLM) has been applied to reduce the PAPR of a transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The cyclic-SLM generates a signal candidate by combining an original signal and its cyclic shifted signal. The Cyclic SLM requires side information regarding the cyclic shift to recover the signal while it will reduce the throughput of a wireless OFDM system. The propossed scheme applies delayed correlation based estimation to omit the transmision of the SI. In the receiver side, the amount of the cyclic shift is estimated with exploiting the correlation between a guard interval sequence and a received signal. Numerical results show that the cyclic-SLM with the delayed correlation (DC) provides significant PAPR reduction while it realizes the accuracy of the shift estimation close to 100% at E_b/N_0 of 8 dB. It also achieves the PAPR that is equivalent to the conventional SLM and the bit error rate degradation is slightly different from that with perfect shift estimation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Correlation","Silicon","Receivers","Accuracy","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic-selective mapping","delayed correlation","time domain","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","side information","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless OFDM system","bit error rate"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145994","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145994.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction Using Cyclic-Selective Mapping with Delayed Correlation in Time Domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction Using Cyclic-Selective Mapping with Delayed Correlation in Time Domain","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15288212","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7145994/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction Using Cyclic-Selective Mapping with Delayed Correlation in Time Domain","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038071S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145998,"authors":[{"name":"Mansour M.

This has resulted into cellular network expansion and upgrade that have increased energy costs and generated environmental concerns. Distributed antenna systems (DAS) are applied to enhance the coverage of the cell via geographically distributed antennas elements (DAEs) which are connected to the base station that is located at the centre of the cell. In this paper, DAS is proposed as a network solution to fulfill increasing capacity demands while addressing the energy efficiency (EE) and environmental concerns associated with cellular network operation. Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) and Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) are applied to calculate the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE), EE and energy consumption ratio (ECR). Nakagami-m fading and log-normal shadowing are considered. Our results demonstrate that DAS using MRT and FFR increases the spectral and energy efficiency of the network compared to a basic cellular network system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07145998.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7145998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Energy Efficient Distributed Antenna Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","data communication","energy conservation","environmental factors","frequency allocation","log normal distribution","mobile antennas","Nakagami channels","smart phones","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed antenna system EE performance analysis","data traffic","data hungry applications","smart mobile device","cellular network expansion","distributed antenna element","DAE","DAS energy efficiency","environmental concerns","maximum ratio transmission","fractional frequency reuse","downlink ergodic spectral efficiency","downlink ergodic SE","energy consumption ratio","ECR","base station","Nakagami-m fading capacity","log-normal shadowing","MRT","FFR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7145998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Energy Efficient Distributed Antenna Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7145998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288182","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Energy Efficient Distributed Antenna Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053701S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7145998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7145999,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Shafique Ansari","affiliation":["Computer Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Makkah Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Imran Shafique","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37679657400"},{"name":"Ferkan Yilmaz","affiliation":["Vodafone Technology in Turkey, ITU, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ferkan","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37408923000"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Makkah Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7145999","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Fading","Simulation","Optical transmitters","Communication systems","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FSO links","unified gamma-gamma turbulence channels","free-space optical link","unified exact closed-form expressions","asymptotic expressions","ergodic capacity","simple elementary functions","computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present a unified performance analysis of a free-space optical (FSO) link that accounts for pointing errors and both types of detection techniques (i.e. intensity modulation/direct detection as well as heterodyne detection).

SSB-DFTs-OFDM is generated by eliminating USB (Upper Side Band) or LSB (Lower Side Band) spectrum in frequency domain after DFT spreading of multi-level BPSK signals, thus Hilbert transformer is not necessary to generate SSB signals. The simulation results show that SSB-DFTs-OFDM achieves almost the same PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) and ACLP (adjacent channel power leakage) as conventional DFTs-OFDM and lower PAPR and ACLP than OFDM and required bandwidth can be reduced by half when BPSK modulation is employed. Furthermore, SSB-DFTs-OFDM using multi-level BPSK shows less error floor and/or Eb/N0 degradation compared with conventional DFTs-OFDM using QAM modulation in some cases when HPA OBO (Output Back Off) is small. SSB-DFTs-OFDM is an attractive alternative to DFTs-OFDM for WLAN and cellular applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Binary phase shift keying","Amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Discrete Fourier transforms","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","Hilbert transforms","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiofrequency power amplifiers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary phase shift keying","WLAN applications","cellular applications","output back off","QAM modulation","adjacent channel power leakage","peak to average power ratio","ACLP","PAPR","Hilbert transformer","multilevel BPSK modulation signal","lower side band elimination","LSB elimination","USB elimination","upper side band elimination","frequency domain","nonlinear high power amplifier","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","discrete Fourier transform spreading","single side band transmission","nonlinear HPA OBO","DFTs-OFDM SSB transmission performance evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146006","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146006.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of SSB Transmission of DFTs-OFDM Using Multi-Level BPSK through Nonlinear HPA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of SSB Transmission of DFTs-OFDM Using Multi-Level BPSK through Nonlinear HPA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146006/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146006/","accessionNumber":"15288132","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of SSB Transmission of DFTs-OFDM Using Multi-Level BPSK through Nonlinear HPA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052807S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7146007,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehong Gao","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

In this paper, we discuss the interference coordination and mitigation problem in the dynamic TDD network. With cell-clustering interference mitigation, the synchronous operation can be provided in a cluster and well isolation can be obtained between cells in the different clusters. Furthermore, we propose that the simplified downlink CoMP DCS mode can be used in the clusters to optimize the downlink performance. At last of the paper, we analyze the performance gain of the proposed scheme by system level simulation.

In this paper, we consider a CR scheme, which opportunistically accesses a PR channel for communication between a pair of nodes based on the stop-and-wait hybrid automatic repeat request (SW-HARQ). Hence, it is referred to as the cognitive SW-HARQ (CSW-HARQ) arrangement. In our CSW-HARQ system, the PR channel is modelled as a two-state Markov chain having `On' and `Off' states. The CR may only access the PR channel in its `Off' state. In this paper, we analyze both the throughput and delay performance of the CSW-HARQ system, for which a range of closed-form formulas are derived that are also validated by simulation results. Our performance results show that both the activities of PR users and the reliability of the CR channel have a substantial impact on the achievable performance of the CR system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146009.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Cognitive Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest: Stop-and-Wait","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Transmitters","Throughput","Automatic repeat request","Receivers","Sensors","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","Markov processes","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum hole detection","cognitive radio","primary radio licensed spectrum","cognitive SW-HARQ","CSW-HARQ","cognitive stop-and-wait hybrid automatic repeat request","PR channel","two-state Markov chain","CR channel reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Cognitive Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest: Stop-and-Wait","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288124","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Cognitive Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest: Stop-and-Wait","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06074S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146011,"authors":[{"name":"Jaroslaw Sadowski","affiliation":["Department of Radio Communication Systems and Networks, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Jaroslaw","lastName":"Sadowski","id":"37410303600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146011","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Time measurement","Sea measurements","Position measurement","Tracking loops","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","direction-of-arrival estimation","radio receivers","radionavigation","time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA","radionavigation receiver","subsample time measurement resolution","position estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents results of investigation of position estimation performance in TDOA radionavigation system with receiver containing code tracking loop with sub-sample time measurement resolution.

This co-existence has several impacts on the whole network. This has motivated us to study the performance of a more practical dual-hop underlay cognitive network, by considering the interference power constraint, the primary transceiver and the co-channel interference (CCI).We start by determining the equivalent signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the secondary network, then, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the equivalent SINR. Using the derived CDF, system outage probability has been assessed. Furthermore, an approximate expression for the system average error probability has been derived. From the results it can be observed that besides the impact of the interference power constraint, the presence of the primary transmitter and the CCI will severely reduce the system performance especially when the CCI linearly increases with the secondary transmit power. Finally, numerical results and Monte Carlo simulations are also provided to sustain the correctness of the analytical derivations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146013.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Study of the Dual-Hop Underlay Cognitive Network in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146013/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Study of the Dual-Hop Underlay Cognitive Network in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287921","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Study of the Dual-Hop Underlay Cognitive Network in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05779S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146014,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Woltering","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Woltering","id":"37085440954"},{"name":"Dirk Wubben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Wubben","id":"37269338400"},{"name":"Armin Dekorsy","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dekorsy","id":"37284963100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146014","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Equalizers","Relays","Interference","Silicon carbide","Robustness","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error statistics","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer network coding","Gaussian waveforms","two way relay channels","multicarrier TWRC system","soft interference cancellation","SIC equalizer","intrinsic interference","Gaussian transmit filters","Gaussian receive filters","bit error rates","rectangular waveforms","PLNC systems"]}],"abstract":"The performance of physical-layer network coding (PLNC) in two way relay channels (TWRCs) is significantly decreased by impairments like carrier frequency offsets or timing offsets. This mismatch cannot be completely compensated at the receiver side, even if the offsets are known. Multi-carrier systems with Gaussian waveforms for TWRC systems are more robust against the impact of these offsets. In comparison to rectangular multi-carrier systems, Gaussian waveforms have a better time-frequency shape and they provide improved spectral efficiency due to lower out of band radiations. In this paper, we introduce a multi-carrier TWRC system with Gaussian waveforms and develop an adapted soft interference cancellation (SIC) equalizer to consider the intrinsic interference of the Gaussian transmit/receive filters. The presented results show, that systems with Gaussian waveforms achieve bit error rates close to the rectangular waveforms in PLNC systems while being more robust against Doppler and delay spreads.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146014","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Gaussian Waveforms using Soft Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Gaussian Waveforms using Soft Interference Cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146014/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288017","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Gaussian Waveforms using Soft Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1160102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10223S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146015,"authors":[{"name":"David E.

Our approach is shown to be robust against the eavesdropper's channel being correlated with that of the legitimate users, and also active attacks in which the eavesdropper injects fraudulent messages into the system. For the active attack, we show that when the eavesdropper injects fraudulent messages into the system, they will also inadvertently allow the legitimate users to calculate a lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the channel. This allows them to establish whether secrecy has been achieved. A consequence of our approach is that the degrees of freedom within the channel are halved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Security over OFDM-Based Links: Conjugate-and-Return","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Security","OFDM","Fading","Channel capacity","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic messaging","fading channels","OFDM modulation","private key cryptography","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fraudulent message","malicious attacker","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing fading channel","secret key exchange","conjugate and return method","OFDM based link","physical layer security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Security over OFDM-Based Links: Conjugate-and-Return","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288123","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Security over OFDM-Based Links: Conjugate-and-Return","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052422S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146017,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Gholami-Boroujeny","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Shiva","lastName":"Gholami-Boroujeny","id":"38277784200"},{"name":"Adel O.

Performance comparisons with the traditional SC DS- CDMA block transmission system are presented. A key feature of the proposed transmission technique is that, unlike SC DS-CDMA transmissions, the original code orthogonality between users is preserved despite propagation through multipath frequency selective channels, thus ideally allowing the decoupling of the signals at the receiver side. Besides this advantage, and mostly due to it, the performance results indicate a clear superiority of the proposed system over the traditional SC DS-CDMA.

Different beamforming strategies are presented, analysed and compared. Compressive sensing (CS) is investigated to accurately estimate the sparse Power Angular Profile (PAP) of the mmWave channel. This information is then used to estimate the antenna array weights required to steer the beam to maximise received SNR. This scheme is particularly attractive for outdoor mmWave networks where large antenna arrays are necessary to mitigate high observed pathloss.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems have been extensively used in digital communication systems, for they are extremely efficient in terms of channel estimation and equalization. Estimation being a crucial part of digital communication systems, techniques have been developed to reduce the impact of noise on the channel estimation process, the optimal one being the LMMSE one. Until recently, non-orthogonal multicarrier modulations such as FBMC, were unable to use OFDM-like estimation techniques due to the non-orthogonality. The interference approximation method (IAM) is one of the most popular method among preamblebased estimation techniques with a limited complexity. This paper present a combination of IAM and a LMMSE-based algorithm that makes possible to achieve a LMMSE estimation in FBMC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble-Based LMMSE Channel Estimation in OFDM/OQAM Modulation","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146025","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Preamble-Based LMMSE Channel Estimation in OFDM/OQAM Modulation","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146025/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288136","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble-Based LMMSE Channel Estimation in OFDM/OQAM Modulation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048002S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146027,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Navarro","affiliation":["Universidad Icesi Cali, Colombia"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Navarro","id":"37269048500"},{"name":"Dinael Guevara","affiliation":["Francisco de Paula Santander University, Cucuta, Colombia"],"firstName":"Dinael","lastName":"Guevara","id":"37546227000"},{"name":"Jorge Gomez","affiliation":["University of Magdalena, Santa Martha, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37085514181"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146027","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Ray tracing","Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Diffraction","Buildings","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","delay estimation","game theory","graphics processing units","MIMO communication","prediction theory","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game engine","channel delay spread estimation","3D ray launching tool","graphics processing units","GPU","channel measurements","MIMO system","Ilmenau","ray angular separation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we show results of channel delay spread estimation using a 3D ray launching tool based on Game Engines and GPU, comparing simulation results with channel measurements of a MIMO system taken in Ilmenau.

In the HST scenarios, not only phase noise but also Doppler shift should be considered. In previous works, our proposed iterative phase noise compensation method was evaluated with a dynamic channel model with high Doppler shift. The efficacy of the iterative method, employing symbol level decision directed channel estimation (SDDCE), was demonstrated with the dynamic channel model. However, parameters of the channel model need to be obtained further for the HST environments. In this paper, we construct a linear HST environment, and analyse the propagation characteristics of the HST scenario with a ray tracing method at 60 GHz band. With the simulation, we obtain the received power, the K factor of the Rician model, delay spread, and angular spread characteristics of the HST environment. It is shown that the K factor is large when the distance between the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas is short, and that when the distance between the Tx and Rx is large, the level of fading becomes large, which is much different from the indoor environment. We also complete the dynamic channel model with the obtained statistical parameters, which can simulate the dynamic channel fluctuation due to the Doppler shift.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Analysis with Ray Tracing Method for High Speed Trains Environment at 60 GHz","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146034","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146034.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Analysis with Ray Tracing Method for High Speed Trains Environment at 60 GHz","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146034/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Analysis with Ray Tracing Method for High Speed Trains Environment at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06292S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146035,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Miyazaki","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"38557777600"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146035","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Frequency-domain analysis","Computational complexity","MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","belief propagation","QR decomposition","maximum likelihood block signal detection","frequency-domain iterative interference cancellation","inter-symbol interference","frequency-domain equalization","minimum mean square error method","PBC-SC transmission","frequency-domain block signal detection","pseudo block coded single-carrier transmission"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146035","abstract":"Recently, we proposed a pseudo block coded single-carrier (PBC-SC) transmission using minimum mean square error (MMSE) based frequency-domain equalization and decoding (FDED) and show that MMSE based FDED achieves BER performance superior to 2-step decoding (which performs frequency-domain equalization and hard decision decoding separately). However, there still exists a large BER performance gap between MMSE based FDED and MF bound due to the presence of residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) after MMSE based FDED. In this paper, in order to narrow the performance gap, we propose frequency-domain block signal detection (FDBD) aided FDEDs for PBC-SC transmission: frequency-domain iterative interference cancellation (FDIC), maximum likelihood block sig-nal detection employing QR decomposition and M algorithm (QRM-MLBD) and belief propagation (BP). We compare, by computer simulation, the BER performances and the computa-tional complexities of three FDBD aided FDED schemes. It is shown that QRM-MLBD and BP can achieve almost the same BER performance as MF bound with much lower computational complexity than MMSE based FDED.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146035","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146035.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo Block Coded Single-Carrier Transmission Using Frequency-Domain Block Signal Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo Block Coded Single-Carrier Transmission Using Frequency-Domain Block Signal Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287988","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146035/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo Block Coded Single-Carrier Transmission Using Frequency-Domain Block Signal Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080573S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146036,"authors":[{"name":"Mouna Hajir","firstName":"Mouna","lastName":"Hajir","id":"37085457377"},{"name":"Francois Gagnon","firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"37085457103"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146036","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Admission control","Resource management","Interference","Bandwidth","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","probability","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell channel partitioning","blocking probability","QoS-aware admission control analytical model","downlink cross-tier interference","FFR","OFDMA two-tier macrocell-femtocell network throughput enhancement","outage probability reduction","fractional frequency reuse","fractional frequency based allocation"]}],"abstract":"Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) is considered to provide enhancement in total throughput and an important reduction of the outage probability in two-tier macrocell-femtocell networks.

The optimal parameters for cell channel partitioning in the proposed FFR-scheme are integrated to enhance the proposed system.

These devices have to be able to ensure both a minimum Quality of Service (QoS) and a minimum level of security when gathering and transmitting data. Compressive Sensing (CS) is a relatively new theory that performs simultaneous lightweight compression and encryption and can be used to prolong the battery lifetime of devices. In this paper, we stress the fact that on the contrary with most previous approaches, the sparsity of the signals can change significantly due to their time-varying nature. We propose a rate-adaptive scheme for maintaining a maximum level of reconstruction error at the receiver, and ensure the QoS requirements. This scheme uses a change point detection method, detecting the change in the sparsity, and estimating the optimum compression rate for maintaining a minimum reconstruction error. Performance is evaluated using real experimental data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC

(NOMA) is one of the promising radio access techniques for further cellular enhancements toward 5G. Compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) such as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), large performance gains were confirmed via system-level simulations. However, NOMA link-level simulations and the design of the receiver remain of great importance to validate NOMA performance gains. In this paper, we evaluate downlink NOMA link-level performance with multiple receiver designs and propose a novel NOMA transmitter and receiver design, where the signals of multi-users are jointly modulated at transmitter side and detected at receiver side. The predominant advantage of the proposed scheme is that at receiver side interference cancellation to the interference signal is not needed, thus low complexity is achieved. The performances of codeword-level SIC, symbol-level SIC and the proposed receiver are evaluated and compared with ideal SIC. Simulation results show that compared with ideal SIC, downlink NOMA link-level performance depends on actual receiver design and the difference in the power ratio split between the cell edge user and cell center user. In particular, it is shown that codeword-level SIC and the proposed receiver can both provide a good performance even when the power ratio difference between the cell center user and cell edge user is small and with real channel estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146043/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15288353","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146043/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Receiver Design for Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver Design for Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069271S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7146044,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It calls for the cohabitation of users in the power domain at the transmitter side and for successive interference canceller (SIC) at the receiver side. Taking into account multi-user scheduling, subband assignment and transmit power allocation, a hybrid NOMA scheme is introduced. Adaptive switching to orthogonal signaling (OS) is performed whenever the non-orthogonal cohabitation in the power domain does not improve the achieved data rate per subband. In addition, a new power allocation technique based on waterfilling is introduced to improve the total achieved system throughput. We show that the proposed strategy for resource allocation improves both the spectral efficiency and the cell-edge user throughput. It also proves to be robust in the case of communications in crowded areas.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146056.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146056","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for Future Radio Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146056/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for Future Radio Access","htmlLink":"/document/7146056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15288066","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for Future Radio Access","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05685S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7146060,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohua Lu","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085393250"},{"name":"Jiaqi Ning","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Ning","id":"37085396266"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085395770"},{"name":"Tian Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085386318"},{"name":"Wenqian Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085385904"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146060","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"abstract":"For massive MIMO system with hundreds of antennas at the base station (BS), zero forcing (ZF) precoding can achieve the near-optimal capacity due to the asymptotically orthogonal channel, but it involves complicated matrix inversion of large size. In this paper, we propose a Richardson Method (RM) based precoding to avoid the complicated matrix inversion in an iterative way, which can reduce the complexity by one order of magnitude. We also prove that the optimal relaxation parameter to RM can be approached by a simple and quantified value to maximize the convergence rate of RM-based precoding, which only depends on the number of BS antennas and the number of users.

Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed robust schemes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146065.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Beamforming Techniques for MISO Secrecy Communication with a Cooperative Jammer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146065/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming Techniques for MISO Secrecy Communication with a Cooperative Jammer","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287973","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming Techniques for MISO Secrecy Communication with a Cooperative Jammer","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15526S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7146067,"authors":[{"name":"Xinzheng Jie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinzheng","lastName":"Jie","id":"37085479851"},{"name":"Yunxiao Zu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunxiao","lastName":"Zu","id":"37299824400"},{"name":"Hongjian Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjian","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085355855"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146067","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Robustness","MIMO","Uncertainty","Interference","Simulation","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cognitive radio","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","precoding","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-definite programming","sum of mean square error","min-max problem","amplify-and-forward","interference temperature","primary users","secondary users","two-way relay","multi-input multi-output","cognitive networks","MIMO","robust relay precoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates robust precoding with bounded channel uncertainties for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) cognitive networks which are equipped with two-way relay (TWR).

Exploiting a preamble of two identical parts and proceeding in two stages, the proposed technique achieves synchronization under non- coherent detection. To take advantage from transmit diversity, we use differential Alamouti space time block coding which provides full- spatial diversity without requiring any channel knowledge in neither the transmitter nor the receiver. Two different replicas of the preamble are generated and sent simultaneously from dual- antenna transmitter. At the receiver side, a coarse synchronization is first carried onto the received signal to roughly localize the preamble respecting the famous Cox and Schmidl algorithm. Second, differential Alamouti decoding must be achieved to recover the transmitted signal. Then, a fine synchronization metric is calculated based on cross-correlating the recovered signal with the local known preamble to detect the exact preamble start. The fine metric is calculated over a short interval around the coarse time estimate which relaxes the computational complexity of this stage. As a byproduct, the fractional part of the frequency offset is estimated using the same timing metric. Computer simulations carried to evaluate the proposed technique show its robustness in the Rayleigh fading channel under non-coherent reception.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular

the context of physical layer security, a physical layer characteristic is used as a common source of randomness to generate the secret key. Therefore an accurate estimation of this characteristic is the core for reliable secret key generation. Estimation of almost all the existing physical layer characteristic suffer dramatically at low signal to noise (SNR) levels. In this paper, we propose a novel secret key generation algorithm that is based on the estimated angle of arrival (AoA) between the two legitimate nodes. Our algorithm has an outstanding performance at very low SNR levels. Our algorithm can exploit either the Azimuth AoA to generate the secret key or both the Azimuth and Elevation angles to generate the secret key. Exploiting a second common source of randomness adds an extra degree of freedom to the performance of our algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the algorithm that uses the most commonly used characteristics of the physical layer which are channel amplitude and phase. We show that our algorithm has a very low bit mismatch rate (BMR) at very low SNR when both channel amplitude and phase based algorithm fail to achieve an acceptable BMR.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146072","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146072.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret Key Generation Based on AoA Estimation for Low SNR Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secret Key Generation Based on AoA Estimation for Low SNR Conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146072/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287858","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146072/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret Key Generation Based on AoA Estimation for Low SNR Conditions","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099166S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7146073,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085564279"},{"name":"Ruohan Cao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38028640400"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"},{"name":"Cong Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085335635"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146073","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Optimization","Iterative methods","Security","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","electronic messaging","interference suppression","iterative methods","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure beamforming design","wiretap MISO interference channel","secrecy communication","eavesdropper","message transmission","transmitters","secrecy sum rate maximisation","power constraint","complex nonconvex problem","iterative algorithm","constrained concave convex procedure","successive convex approximation","CCCP","SCA","null-space beamforming design scheme","beamforming vectors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146073","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146073","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","abstract":"In this paper, we study the secrecy communication in two-user MISO interference networks where an external eavesdropper is interested in the messages transmitted by both transmitters.

In conventional three dimensional (3D) MIMO studies, the antenna elements (AEs) in one column are usually virtualized as one antenna port and the transmission schemes in long term evolution system (LTE) or other systems can be reused. In this case, multi-stream transmission can only be supported by the horizontal direction. While in massive MIMO systems with more AEs, forming one antenna port in the vertical direction to support single stream transmission will be inefficient. In this paper, we propose two joint port virtualization and multi-stream transmission algorithms in the framework of separated horizontal and vertical feedback. The proposed algorithms make a better tradeoff between the beamwidth and the number of simultaneously supported data streams. A rank indication (RI) feedback scheme is also proposed to assist the multi-stream transmission.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146081","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separated Horizontal and Vertical Transmission Methods in Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Separated Horizontal and Vertical Transmission Methods in Massive MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146081/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288263","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146081/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separated Horizontal and Vertical Transmission Methods in Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048947S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7146085,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Felipe Del Carpio","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Luis Felipe","lastName":"Del Carpio","id":"37085556653"},{"name":"Alexis A.

Based on obtained performance results, it is possible to conclude that three-hop cooperative transmission with backward IC provides better performance than its two-hop counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146085","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146085.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Clustering Methods for Multi-Hop Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Simple Clustering Methods for Multi-Hop Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146085/","accessionNumber":"15288055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146085/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Clustering Methods for Multi-Hop Cooperative Device-to-Device Communication","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054696S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7146087,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Benkhelifa","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Benkhelifa","id":"38469385500"},{"name":"Ahmed Kamal Sultan Salem","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, SA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Kamal Sultan","lastName":"Salem"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146087","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for a decode-and-forward (DF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay system where the relay is an energy harvesting node.

networks based on smart grid and smart metering applications will be highly decentralized. Cellular wireless is one promising technology to interconnect novel energy grids. Although industrial wireless standards are seen as one of the new study items for 5G radio systems, 3G/4G-based technology may cover this field until tailored standards become available. Due to the beneficial propagation conditions below 500 MHz, cellular radio systems operating at these frequencies are getting more attention, especially in the case of rural and suburban deployments. In this paper, we investigate the propagation characteristics at 450 MHz in a suburban to rural environment using cellular radio technology. Extensive measurements were done in a test pilot installation using latest LTE technology. The results are based on pilot symbols collected during the campaign. They show the coverage in the chosen environment and highlight channel characteristics at 450 MHz. Delay spreads (DS) and shadow fading (SF) coefficients are detailed and a generalized pathloss model is derived. The results can be used for propagation modeling in similar environments as well as to complement and verify channel models for similar frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146091","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146091.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Grid Communications: LTE Outdoor Field Trials at 450 MHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Smart Grid Communications: LTE Outdoor Field Trials at 450 MHz","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146091/","accessionNumber":"15288046","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146091/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Grid Communications: LTE Outdoor Field Trials at 450 MHz","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062804S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7146098,"authors":[{"name":"Weixi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Weixi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38260049500"},{"name":"Jingxian Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Jingxian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279160700"},{"name":"Pingzhi Fan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Pingzhi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085344210"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146098","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Efficient Doppler Diversity Transmissions in High Mobility Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","abstract":"This paper studies spectral efficient Doppler diversity transmissions in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Fast time-varying fading in high mobility communication systems introduces Doppler diversity that can benefit system performance. On the other hand, it is more difficult to estimate and track fast time-varying channel, thus channel estimation errors might seriously degrade system performance in high mobility systems. We propose a practical pilot- assisted system design that can balance the tradeoff between Doppler diversity and channel estimation errors. At the transmitter, the data symbols are precoded with a rate-1 Doppler domain multiplexing scheme to achieve maximum Doppler diversity without sacrificing spectral efficiency. At the receiver, the information is detected by using imperfect CSI and a block decision feedback equalizer (BDFE), which is developed by exploiting the statistical properties of channel estimation errors. The analytical pairwise error probability (PEP) and a bit error rate (BER) lower bound are developed by considering a large number of design parameters, such as the percentage of pilot symbols in the transmitted symbols, the energy allocation between pilot and data symbols, and the maximum Doppler spread of the channel. Both simulation and analytical results show that maximum Doppler diversity can be achieved through optimizations of the various design parameters in the presence of imperfect CSI.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146098","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146098","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Covariance matrices","Receivers","Diversity reception","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","diversity reception","Doppler effect","error statistics","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficient Doppler diversity transmissions","mobility systems","channel estimation errors","channel state information","time varying fading channel","practical pilot assisted system design","Doppler domain multiplexing","maximum Doppler diversity","block decision feedback equalizer","pairwise error probability","bit error rate lower bound","maximum Doppler spread"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146098/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Efficient Doppler Diversity Transmissions in High Mobility Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","accessionNumber":"15288220","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146098/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Efficient Doppler Diversity Transmissions in High Mobility Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054021S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146101,"authors":[{"name":"Stavroula Vassaki","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stavroula","lastName":"Vassaki","id":"37542352100"},{"name":"Marios I.

We take advantage from the fact that the probability density function (PDF) of the channel power gain can be approximated by a left-truncated Gaussian distribution if the number of transmit and receive antennas is large. Assuming a symmetrical Doppler power spectral density (PSD), a closed- form expression is presented for the Rice probability function of the outage durations. This function, in general, approximates the PDF of the outage intervals only over its initial part. By applying the asymptotic behavior of level crossings of Gaussian processes, an alternative expression, valid only for low capacity thresholds, is obtained, which, in turn, is applied to determine an approximate solution for the kth-order moments of the outage intervals. Also presented is the PDF of the so- called instantaneous capacity loss with respect to the average capacity. Simulation results have been shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical approximations, thereby confirming their validity. Although, the focus of the study is on massive MIMO systems, it has been observed that the approximations are accurate even for a moderate number of antennas such as the case of 4\u00d74 MIMO-OSTBC systems.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146107","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146107.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Analysis of the Channel Capacity Outage Intervals in Massive MIMO Systems with OSTBC over Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146107/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis of the Channel Capacity Outage Intervals in Massive MIMO Systems with OSTBC over Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288036","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146107/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis of the Channel Capacity Outage Intervals in Massive MIMO Systems with OSTBC over Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083905S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146109,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Guan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S - UMR 8506), University of Paris-Sud XI (UPS-XI), Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Guan","id":"37085540577"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S - UMR 8506), University of Paris-Sud XI (UPS-XI), Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146109","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Approximation methods","Stochastic processes","Geometry","Nickel","Interference","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","energy conservation","geometry","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","space division multiplexing","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic geometry analysis","multiantenna downlink MIMO cellular network","spectral efficiency mathematical evaluation","energy efficiency mathematical evaluation","base stations","BS","Poisson point process","PPP","spatial multiplexing multiple input multiple output system","receiver antenna","transmitter antenna","Rayleigh fading channel model","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an approximation to the mathematical evaluation of the spectral and energy efficiency of multi-antenna downlink cellular networks is introduced.

The accuracy of the proposed approximation is substantiated with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Geometry Analysis of the Energy Efficiency of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146109","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146109.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Geometry Analysis of the Energy Efficiency of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146109/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288305","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Geometry Analysis of the Energy Efficiency of Downlink MIMO Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065741S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146113,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Bukar","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Bukar","id":"37085551444"},{"name":"Falah Ali","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Falah","lastName":"Ali","id":"37277226200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146113","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Binary phase shift keying","OFDM","Bit error rate","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cochannel interference","encoding","error statistics","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier multiplexing scheme","coordinated multipoint transmission","LTE-COMP OFDMA","cell-edge","joint transmission","coordinated scheduling-coordinated beamforming","CS-CB","coordinating base station","CBS","cochannel interference","CCI","superposition coding","coordinating femtocell access points","CFAP","bit error rates","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) transmission is seen as a valuable tool in LTE-Advanced to improve cell-edge and/or system throughput. CoMP is divided into two categories; Joint Transmission (JT) and Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB). In JT, backhaul data and channel information intended for a user are shared among coordinating base station (CBS) whereas in CS/CB, data is only transmitted from one CBS, however scheduling and beamforming are coordinated to reduce the effect of co-channel interference (CCI).This paper introduces a novel subcarrier multiplexing scheme which aims to exploit the extra degrees of freedom provided by CoMP systems based on the principles of superposition coding. Multiple streams from coordinating femtocell access points (CFAP) are superimposed together such that they produce a unique interference pattern known at the receiver which is equipped with a single antenna. Simulation results show that we get an increase in data rate according to the number of CFAP. The proposed scheme also provides better bit error rates compared to traditional schemes, with minimal overhead signalling and without the need for channel estimation at receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Multiplexing in LTE-COMP OFDMA","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146113","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Multiplexing in LTE-COMP OFDMA","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146113/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288234","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Multiplexing in LTE-COMP OFDMA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077064S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146114,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Gui","affiliation":["Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gui"},{"name":"Zhengyu Zhu","affiliation":["Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146114","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Complexity theory","Simulation","Convergence","Interference","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","energy harvesting","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO system","SWIPT","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","multiuser broadcast","BC","multiple-input multiple-output system","base station","information decoding","ID users","energy harvesting","EH","optimal rate energy","R-E boundary","multiple access channel","MAC","dirty paper coding","transceivers","encoding","decoding","suboptimal algorithm","weighted minimum mean square error","WMMSE approach"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multiuser broadcast (BC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, in which a base station sends messages to several information decoding (ID) users, and transmits wireless power to multiple energy harvesting (EH) user at the same time. We aim to maximize the sum-rate of the ID users while maintaining a minimum EH constraint for each EH user. Firstly, an optimal rate-energy (R-E) boundary is characterized by using a BC-multiple access channel (MAC) duality derived from dirty paper coding (DPC). Since the complexity of the DPC is quite high due to continuously encoding and decoding at the transceivers, we then propose a sub- optimal algorithm using a weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach, which has lower complexity and iteratively converges a local optimal point. Finally, the performance comparisons and convergence properties are illustrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146114","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146114.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Rate Maximizing in a Multi-User MIMO System with SWIPT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146114/","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate Maximizing in a Multi-User MIMO System with SWIPT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287849","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate Maximizing in a Multi-User MIMO System with SWIPT","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052526S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"15","articleId":"7146114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146116,"authors":[{"name":"Yejian Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Yejian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716852900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146116","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Noise","Binary phase shift keying","Decoding","Security","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error correction codes","forward error correction","Monte Carlo methods","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed pilot symbol","secure communication","multiple antenna array","trellis-based joint channel tracking","data detection","power ratio","data symbol","forward error correction code","FEC code rate","eavesdropping","secure capacity region","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate secure communications by introducing superimposed pilots for multiple antenna system.

The combination of the two techniques in a cellular network with large cells however, results in timing asynchronization. This leads to symbol timing offset (STO) and, thus, degrades users' performance. In this paper, we propose a novel user position aware (UPA) algorithm to tackle the timing offset problem by partitioning the coverage area into different zones based on users' received power requirements. Serving base stations in each zone are assigned such that their distances to a user within the zone are bounded. Hence, the time difference of signals arrived at the user is controlled and, therefore, the effect of STO is mitigated. We analyze the performance of the proposed method by deriving bounds on the STO, and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in different zones. Simulation results confirm that the proposed UPA algorithm significantly reduces the STO and improves users' SINR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Timing Offset Mitigation in OFDMA-Based CoMP Utilizing Position Aware Transmission","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146118","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Timing Offset Mitigation in OFDMA-Based CoMP Utilizing Position Aware Transmission","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146118/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Timing Offset Mitigation in OFDMA-Based CoMP Utilizing Position Aware Transmission","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1158738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.331774S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146120,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Saito","affiliation":["5G Radio Access Network Research Group, 5G Laboratory"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Saito","id":"37085580430"},{"name":"Anass Benjebbour","affiliation":["5G Radio Access Network Research Group, 5G Laboratory"],"firstName":"Anass","lastName":"Benjebbour","id":"37294604500"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["5G Radio Access Network Research Group, 5G Laboratory"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37085578262"},{"name":"Takehiro Nakamura","affiliation":["5G Radio Access Network Research Group, 5G Laboratory"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37085367282"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146120","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Macrocell networks","Performance gain","MIMO","Interference","Resource management","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","adaptive codes","radio links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system level performance","downlink nonorthogonal multiple access","NOMA","various environments","spectrum efficiency","5th generation mobile communication systems","macrocell deployment","long-term evolution","LTE","single user multiple-input multiple-output","SU-MIMO technique","adaptive modulation and coding","AMC","feedback channel quality indicator","CQI","computer simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146120","abstract":"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access scheme for further improving the spectrum efficiency compared to that for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in the 5th Generation (5G) mobile communication systems.

Currently, small cells are becoming important and being studied for future Long-Term Evolution (LTE) enhancements in order to improve further the system performance. Thus, it is of great interest to study the performance of NOMA for small cell deployment under various environments. This paper investigates the system level performance of NOMA in small cells considering practical assumptions such as the single user multiple-input multiple-output (SU-MIMO) technique, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), feedback channel quality indicator (CQI). Some of the key NOMA specific functionalities, including multi-user paring and transmit power allocation are also taken into account in the evaluation.

Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields high users' satisfaction percentage of a minimum of 90% for up to 4 users per small cell, moderate power consumption, and/or high latency gain.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146129","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146129.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Fog Balancing: Load Distribution for Small Cell Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146129/","displayDocTitle":"The Fog Balancing: Load Distribution for Small Cell Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146129/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288125","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Fog Balancing: Load Distribution for Small Cell Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043276S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146130,"authors":[{"name":"Di Kong","affiliation":["Communications Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Kong","id":"38238883900"},{"name":"Evangelos Mellios","affiliation":["Communications Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Mellios","id":"37593623900"},{"name":"Geoffrey Hilton","affiliation":["Communications Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Hilton","id":"37279623700"},{"name":"Angela Doufexi","affiliation":["Communications Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Doufexi","id":"37085367424"},{"name":"Andrew Nix","affiliation":["Communications Systems & Networks Group, University of Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Nix","id":"37276828100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146130","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Throughput","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","home networks","IEEE standards","MIMO communication","radio links","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output","beamforming data throughput","Wi-Fi beamforming system","radio links","spatial stream","medium range channel","IEEE 802.11n standard","access point","antenna selection","regulatory transmit power constraint","WLAN","multielement in-home wireless local area network","frequency 5 GHz"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Regulatory Transmit Power Constraints on the Relative Performances of Wi-Fi Beamforming and Antenna Selection","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146130.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146130","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146130","abstract":"This paper analyses the theoretic throughput and coverage for a multi-element in-home Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) in the 5 GHz band.

A novel methodology is applied based on part measurement and part simulation. In home results are provided for standard 802.11n multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) deployments. Results show that beamforming is particularly affected by regulatory transmit power constraints. For long-range links beamforming data throughputs are reduced by more than 50%. The average data rate in our test home reduces by 14.3% when regulatory constraints are applied to the beamforming system. For antenna selection the regulatory limits result in an 8.9% reduction in average throughput. Furthermore, we show that for long range links the average data rate is improved by 50% when the antenna selection is used in place of beamforming. Although antenna selection uses single stream MIMO more frequently than beamforming, the latter performs better when multiple spatial streams are used. Beamforming is shown to work best in the easy and medium-range channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15288225","htmlLink":"/document/7146130/","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Regulatory Transmit Power Constraints on the Relative Performances of Wi-Fi Beamforming and Antenna Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Regulatory Transmit Power Constraints on the Relative Performances of Wi-Fi Beamforming and Antenna Selection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.636765S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146132,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Yue","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085354319"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"},{"name":"Ruohan Cao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38028640400"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146132","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"abstract":"This paper proposes a linear precoding that aims at maximizing the sum-rate in a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system.

The sum-rate for information decoding users is considered as the optimization policy where the transmit power constraint and power harvesting per user constraints are taken into account. Since the objective function of the sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex, it is difficult to find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm to find a locally optimal design based on a sequential convex approximation (SCA) method. In this way, the non-convex optimization problem is approximated by a convex program at each iteration. Finally, with the aid of the concept of the Rate-Energy (R-E) region simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvement compared to existing works.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sum-Rate Maximization Precoding for Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Receivers","Wireless communication","Energy harvesting","Wireless sensor networks","Optimization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","energy harvesting","iterative methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum rate maximization precoding","multiuser MIMO SWIPT systems","linear precoding","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","SWIPT","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output","receivers harvest energy","optimization policy","transmit power constraint","power harvesting","iterative algorithm","sequential convex approximation","SCA method","nonconvex optimization problem","rate energy region simulation","R-E region simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"The Sum-Rate Maximization Precoding for Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287824","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sum-Rate Maximization Precoding for Multiuser MIMO SWIPT Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088974S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146133,"authors":[{"name":"Guixian Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

Different 5G research projects have acknowledged the demand for a new air interface that will be designed to operate in higher frequency bands (compared to the ones currently allocated to LTE) where propagation is more challenging and coverage is spotty. This paper proposes a radio access network (RAN) architecture that realizes a tight integration of this new air interface with LTE to enable cross-air interface optimizations such as common resource management, faster mobility and simultaneous multi-connectivity features. The tight integration also aims at leveraging both the better coverage of LTE and the higher capacity of the higher frequency bands. In order to realize this integration, a common protocol layer (also called integration layer) lying on the top of lower layer protocols specified per air interface is proposed. The paper analyzes the alternatives for this integration layer, having the LTE protocol stack specified by 3GPP as a reference model. A recommendation is issued and, based on that, potential multi-connectivity features are presented.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146134","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146134.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tight Integration of New 5G Air Interface and LTE to Fulfill 5G Requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tight Integration of New 5G Air Interface and LTE to Fulfill 5G Requirements","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15288130","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146134/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tight Integration of New 5G Air Interface and LTE to Fulfill 5G Requirements","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1160040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051512S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7146135,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbo Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085585186"},{"name":"Caili Guo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Caili","lastName":"Guo","id":"37287906300"},{"name":"Xuekang Sun","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuekang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37534900000"},{"name":"Chunyan Feng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289215100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146135","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146135","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cascading style sheets","Wideband","Sparse matrices","Radio frequency","Matrix decomposition","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","matrix algebra","radio spectrum management","signal detection","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","wideband spectrum detection","sparse sampling matrix","D-CSS scheme","decomposition compressed spectrum sensing scheme","signal reconstruction","spectrum bandwidth","signal recovery","compressive sampling","wideband spectrum sensing"]}],"abstract":"Compressed spectrum sensing (CSS) is proposed to detect spectrum opportunities efficiently over a wideband. However, most of existing CSS approaches will cause high computation costs for signal recovery when spectrum bandwidth goes large. As a result, it prolongs time for spectrum detection, which however runs counter to the original purpose of finding out spectrum opportunities over a wideband as rapidly as possible. To reduce the time consumed in signal reconstruction and realize real- time detection, we propose a novel decomposition compressed spectrum sensing (D-CSS) scheme. In D- CSS, a sparse sampling matrix is constructed first, and then it equivalently means a decomposition of the reconstructing process into two recovery subtasks. In doing so, we can scale down the overall problem and reduce the entire time for wideband spectrum detection compared with current CSS methods for a given desired sensing accuracy. Furthermore, the sparse character of our designed sampling matrix not only facilitates the operations of signal sampling and signal recovery, but also relieves the burden on random seeds generator and memory storage, which alleviates the overall implementation cost in CR practice.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146135","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146135.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing Based on Compressive Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Time-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing Based on Compressive Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146135/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288091","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing Based on Compressive Sampling","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053682S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7146139,"authors":[{"name":"Dang Khoa Nguyen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Dang Khoa","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085444465"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146139","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Throughput","Hardware","Protocols","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Distortion","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","probability","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless systems performance","noise distortion sources","transceiver hardware impairments","DF/AF dual-hop cognitive relay networks","amplify and forward-decode and forward relaying protocol"]}],"abstract":"Transceiver hardware impairments are the distortion noise sources that can degrade performances of wireless systems. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of hardware impairments on outage performance and throughput of the cognitive relay networks with amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol under the transmit power limit constraint. We derive the exact expressions that quantify the impacts of transceiver hardware impairments on outage performance and throughput of the networks and corroborate the results by simulation. It is shown that the impacts of transceiver impairments are nonlinear and increase proportional to the increment of hardware impairment levels. Interestingly, we found that the cognitive relay networks with AF protocol is more susceptible to transceiver hardware impairments than the DF protocol. Consequently, the DF cognitive relay networks provide better outage performance and throughput than the AF cognitive networks in the same specific parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Impairments in DF/AF Dual-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks: Outage Performance and Throughput Analysis","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146139","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Impairments in DF/AF Dual-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks: Outage Performance and Throughput Analysis","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146139/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transceiver Impairments in DF/AF Dual-Hop Cognitive Relay Networks: Outage Performance and Throughput Analysis","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053339S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146141,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085395986"},{"name":"Weidong Mei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085390961"},{"name":"Lingxiang Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lingxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085378138"},{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291476200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146141","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Jamming","Lifting equipment","MIMO","Covariance matrices","Transmitters","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","jamming","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit design","MIMO wiretap channel","malicious jammer","multi-input multi-output system","three-node wiretap channel","legitimate user","eavesdropper channel state information","radio transmitter","inverse water-filling algorithm","optimal power allocation","spatial dimension allocation","artificial noise","ergodic secrecy capacity","average secrecy capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the transmit design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channel including a malicious jammer. We first transform the system model into the traditional three-node wiretap channel by whitening the interference at the legitimate user. Additionally, the eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI) may be fully or statistically known, even unknown to the transmitter. Hence, some strategies are proposed in terms of different levels of ECSI available to the transmitter in our paper. For the case of unknown ECSI, a target rate for the legitimate user is first specified. And then an inverse water-filling algorithm is put forward to find the optimal power allocation for each information symbol, with a stepwise search being used to adjust the spatial dimension allocated to artificial noise (AN) such that the target rate is achievable. As for the case of statistical ECSI, several simulated channels are randomly generated according to the distribution of ECSI. We show that the ergodic secrecy capacity can be approximated as the average secrecy capacity of these simulated channels. Through maximizing this average secrecy capacity, we can obtain a feasible power and spatial dimension allocation scheme by using one dimension search. Finally, numerical results reveal the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146141","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Design for MIMO Wiretap Channel with a Malicious Jammer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Design for MIMO Wiretap Channel with a Malicious Jammer","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146141/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287957","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146141/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Design for MIMO Wiretap Channel with a Malicious Jammer","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098892S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146143,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Muller","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Muller","id":"38062499100"},{"name":"Stephan Hafner","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Hafner","id":"37085388188"},{"name":"Diego Dupleich","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Dupleich","id":"37085364097"},{"name":"Jian Luo","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Luo","id":"37537083200"},{"name":"Egon Schulz","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Egon","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37266353400"},{"name":"Ralf Herrmann","affiliation":["Electronic Measurement Engineering Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Herrmann","id":"37535213400"},{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37323248800"},{"name":"Reiner S.

The convergence of D2D communications and the social commerce services may create a synergistic effect because the D2D user can spontaneously relay the advertisement messages to their neighbors. Accordingly, we here propose Wi-Fi Direct based voluntary advertisement dissemination scenario and algorithm (VADA) for social commerce services. By using our proposed VADA algorithm, the small business owners are able to transmit advertisement messages to many local D2D users cost-effectively. Through intensive simulations, we evaluate the performance excellency of our proposed algorithm with respect to total number of successfully received users, average number of relay users, and transmission efficiency compared with conventional algorithms and optimal algorithm based on exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146154","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VADA: Wi-Fi Direct Based Voluntary Advertisement Dissemination Algorithm for Social Commerce Service","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"VADA: Wi-Fi Direct Based Voluntary Advertisement Dissemination Algorithm for Social Commerce Service","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146154/","accessionNumber":"15287867","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146154/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VADA: Wi-Fi Direct Based Voluntary Advertisement Dissemination Algorithm for Social Commerce Service","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044549S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7146155,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Li","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Li","id":"37085390255"},{"name":"Hooman Shirani-Mehr","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Shirani-Mehr","id":"38274924500"},{"name":"Tommaso Balercia","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Balercia","id":"37546394200"},{"name":"Apostolos Papathanassiou","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Papathanassiou","id":"37359752500"},{"name":"Geng Wu","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37855671600"},{"name":"Shu Sun","affiliation":["NYU WIRELESS, New York University"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37060898100"},{"name":"Mathew Khalil Samimi","affiliation":["NYU WIRELESS, New York University"],"firstName":"Mathew Khalil","lastName":"Samimi","id":"37061092600"},{"name":"Theodore S.

Our approach consists in supplying the extra network capacity at dense traffic areas using directive beams: the Virtual Small Cells (VSCs). VSCs are created at the macrocell by the activation of multiple antenna elements and replace the use of picocells, reducing consequently the OPEX and CAPEX expenses. VSCs are reconfigurable according to traffic fluctuation, can increase the throughput in 50% regarding a only-macrocell deployment and reduce the global network consumed power.","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146162","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145358/7145573/07146162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7145573","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Small Cells Using Large Antenna Arrays as an Alternative to Classical HetNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Small Cells Using Large Antenna Arrays as an Alternative to Classical HetNets","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146162/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15288300","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146162/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Small Cells Using Large Antenna Arrays as an Alternative to Classical HetNets","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1159368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052712S","chronDate":"11-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145358","isNumber":"7145573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145358","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7145573","articleId":"7146162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7146163,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Huusari","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Huusari","id":"37085565369"},{"name":"Yang-Seok Choi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA"],"firstName":"Yang-Seok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37556829200"},{"name":"Petteri Liikkanen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Petteri","lastName":"Liikkanen","id":"37085552595"},{"name":"Dani Korpi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Dani","lastName":"Korpi","id":"37085491520"},{"name":"Shilpa Talwar","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37323366400"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8088-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-2252"}],"articleNumber":"7146163","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146163","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Antenna measurements","Delays","Antennas","Bandwidth","Transmission line measurements","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","network synthesis","power amplifiers","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband self-adaptive RF cancellation circuit","RF circuit architecture","self-interference cancellation","inband full-duplex radio transceivers","wideband cancellation","time-varying self-interference channel","ISM band","antenna","nonlinear power amplifier","frequency 100 MHz","frequency 2.4 GHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel RF circuit architecture for self-interference cancellation in inband full-duplex radio transceivers .

In real situations, as a result of variations of density through soft tissue and contradiction of assuming constant sound speed for medical ultrasound imaging systems, phase aberration is made which causes ambiguity in targets' location and degradation in resolution. This effect has influence on MV beamformer as DAS. In this paper, different levels of near field phase screens have been applied to simulate the manner of MV in the presence of phase aberration. In the next step, a conventional phase aberration correction method is performed before beamforming to retrieve the efficiency of the MV beamformer. Simulations are performed in majority resolution which has the lowest robustness. The results show that the correction algorithm improves the performance of the MV in both terms of resolution and contrast, even in the presence of strong aberrations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15278456","htmlLink":"/document/7146176/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Phase aberration correction in minimum variance beamforming of ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase aberration correction in minimum variance beamforming of ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Bioelectric015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056187S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7146186,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Samieinasab","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Samieinasab","id":"37085581703"},{"name":"Reza Sameni","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Sameni","id":"37547512100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146186","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":896},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrical engineering","Decision support systems","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","audio signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","blind source separation","matrix decomposition","medical signal processing","obstetrics","phonocardiography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fetal phonocardiogram extraction","single channel blind source separation","fetal health status","high-risk pregnancies","fully noninvasive method","fetal heart sound","acoustic signal recording","maternal abdominal surface","empirical mode decomposition","nonnegative matrix factorization","audio signal mixtures","algorithm performance","signal recording data","fetal heart rate","fetal phonocardiogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fetal Phonocardiogram","Fetal heart rate","Blind source separation","Emperical Mode Decomposition","Nonnegative Matrix Factorization"]}],"abstract":"Frequent and long-term monitoring of fetal health status is still a challenging task in high-risk pregnancies. This paper presents a fully noninvasive method to extract fetal heart sound (FHS) from acoustic signals recorded from the maternal abdominal surface. The proposed algorithm is based on single channel blind source separation (SCBSS), which utilizes empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to extracts different sources from audio signal mixtures. To evaluate the algorithm performance, a dataset of 110 pregnant women were collected at Hafez Hospital of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The algorithm performance has been tested on 50 randomly selected sample data of recording signals. The results show very good separation of the fetal heart sound. Quantitative results show that the fetal heart rate (FHR) calculated from the processed channel corresponding to the fetal phonocardiogram (fPCG) has an accuracy of 96% as compared to the simultaneously recorded FHS by means of ultrasound.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146186","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146186.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fetal phonocardiogram extraction using single channel blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146186/","displayDocTitle":"Fetal phonocardiogram extraction using single channel blind source separation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15278457","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146186/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fetal phonocardiogram extraction using single channel blind source separation","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Bioelectric041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057372S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146204,"authors":[{"name":"Faezeh Alavi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran"],"firstName":"Faezeh","lastName":"Alavi","id":"37085427412"},{"name":"Nader Mokari","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Mokari","id":"37680459700"},{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146204","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Resource management","System performance","Electrical engineering","Protocols","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay deployment","secondary user sum-rate","radio resource allocation problem","underlay cognitive network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","secondary user secure communication","two way cooperative communication","two way relays","OFDMA based cognitive radio networks","secure resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical (PHY) layer security","cognitive radio networks","Two-way communication","decode-and-forward relay"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a two-way cooperative communication framework to provide secure communications for secondary users within an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based underlay cognitive network.

The problem is more crucial when femtocells operate in an open access mode. In addition, high speed users initiate unnecessary handovers as they stay in a femtocell for a short time. Taking the above challenges into account, the main goal of this paper is to reduce the number of frequent femtocell-to-femtocell handovers in an open access Long Term Evolution (LTE) network by increasing the time interval between handover triggers. Toward this goal, we propose a new handover decision algorithm which selects the most appropriate target femtocell for handover among many candidates by considering the Received Signal Strength (RSS) and the velocity of the user as decision criteria. Simulation results show about 1.8 times increasing in the time interval between handover triggers and 40% reduction in the amount of handovers in comparison with the traditional handover scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient femtocell-to-femtocell handover decision algorithm in LTE femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146212","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146212.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An efficient femtocell-to-femtocell handover decision algorithm in LTE femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146212/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286805","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient femtocell-to-femtocell handover decision algorithm in LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053023S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146218,"authors":[{"name":"Peyman Siyari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Siyari","id":"37085459678"},{"name":"Hassan Aghaeinia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Aghaeinia","id":"37271668500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146218","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"In this paper, power control in a multiuser MIMO network will be analyzed.

The interesting point is that using the first order expected value instead of calculating covariance matrix, which is prevalent in the most former approaches, addresses many concerns in channel characterization such as estimation ambiguity and the necessity of using precoders which cast doubt on the blindness of the former methods.

In this paper we focus on Rician model of fading channel in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems and evaluate the effect of LOS signal on channel characterization. We show that LOS signal makes correlation between consequent covariance matrices which are used to estimate channel response in OFDM systems. As a result, a weighted average between covariance matrices can improve statistical properties and increase the accuracy of estimation in limited number of OFDM symbols. Motivated by the above idea, we propose a simple updating technique to get optimized performance on channel characterization. We investigate the asymptotic performance of the proposed estimator, i.e. normalized mean square error (NMSE) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), for large numbers of independent observations. The results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in estimating channel response as well as its improvement over the conventional techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146229","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","startPage":"303","endPage":"307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rician channel characterization in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rician channel characterization in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146229/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286740","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146229/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rician channel characterization in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06447S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146240,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mohsen Rezvani","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohsen","lastName":"Rezvani","id":"38244228300"},{"name":"Hengameh Keshavarz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hengameh","lastName":"Keshavarz","id":"37391724700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146240","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transceivers","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Cooperative systems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cooperative communication","electronic data interchange","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","search problems","statistical distributions","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed beamforming design","SINR balancing approach","channel state information SOS","CSI second-order statistics","two-way cooperative network","radio transceiver","distributed relay","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","optimization problem","bisection search method","channel coefficient","data exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two-way networks","distributed beamforming","second-order statistics of CSI","SINR balancing","bisection search method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146240","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146240.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed beamforming design for SINR balancing approach in cooperative two-way networks based on second-order statistics","abstract":"We consider a two-way cooperative network consists of two transceivers and a set of relays.

The anonymous tag estimation problem is referred to the case where the reader is willing to estimate the number of the the tags without individually identifying them. In this paper, we study the anonymous cardinality estimation problem considering the capture effect. The capture effect is referred to the situation where two tags transmit their information simultaneously to the reader. One of the tags is closer to the reader while the other one is farther away. The reader can only hear the transmission of the nearby tag and considers the other transmission as noise. Therefore, instead of a collision, the reader hears a successful transmission. Taking into account the capture effect, we propose two cardinality estimation algorithms by counting the number of successful transmissions and the number of collisions in an interrogation of a reader. We mathematical formulate the probability of capture effect. Using this probability along with the information obtained from the interrogations, we develop our estimators. Our simulation results provide a proof for the accuracy of the estimators and show the performance of the algorithms compared to the other schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146242.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tag estimation in RFID systems with capture effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Radiofrequency identification","Random variables","Electrical engineering","Batteries","Noise","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tag estimation","RFID systems","capture effect","radio frequency identification","anonymous cardinality estimation problem","reader interrogation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio frequency identification (RFID) Systems","capture effect","cardinality estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Tag estimation in RFID systems with capture effect","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146242/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286628","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tag estimation in RFID systems with capture effect","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047397S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146254,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Pashazadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Pashazadeh","id":"37085579062"},{"name":"Foroogh S.

Applying physical layer secrecy approaches will enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without using any secret keys. However, physical layer security approaches are typically feasible only when the source-eavesdropper channel is weaker than the source-destination channel. Cooperative jamming can be used to overcome this challenge and increase the secrecy rate. In this paper, the security of two-phase relaying system with multiple intermediate nodes and in the presence of an eavesdropper is investigated. To enhance the system secrecy rate, a joint cooperative beamforming and jamming combined with relay and jammer selections is proposed. In phase I, the source node broadcasts a signal to relays while three intermediate nodes (which act as jammers) help the source node by transmitting random jamming signals to confuse the eavesdropper. Since the friendly (cooperative) jammers create interference for both the intended relays and the eavesdropper, optimal beamforming is applied such that no interference is caused at two preselected desired relays (that are going to receive the confidential massage in phase I). In phase II, two preselected relays transmit the source message with beamforming coefficients such that the received signal at the eavesdropper is completely nulled out. Our goal in this paper is to minimize the received SNR at the eavesdropper while increasing it at the destination as much as possible by applying different methods such as cooperative beamforming, cooperative jamming and relay selection. To avoid operational complexity, we consider the minimum number of intermediate nodes that are necessary without losing the performance. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed scheme compared with the scheme with no cooperative jamming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146258/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15286750","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146258/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Two-phase cooperative jamming and beamforming for physical layer secrecy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-phase cooperative jamming and beamforming for physical layer secrecy","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094319S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146262,"authors":[{"name":"Maedeh Jamali","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec. and Comp.

When impulse response of channel is long the spectral efficiency of OFDM becomes very low due to using cyclic prefix (CP). Another multicarrier system, which achieves high spectral efficiency, is based on using filter-bank (FB). However, due to using real symbols in OFDM/OQAM, which is high spectral efficient FB-based system, it is not suitable for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques in which complex symbols are employed. In this paper, we proposed a new multicarrier system, in which FB and unique word OFDM (UW-OFDM) techniques are combined together; call FB-UW-OFDM. Since complex symbols are used in the FB-UW-OFDM system, the space-time coding scheme can be employed. The proposed system is following the approach of [1] (we call it FB-CP-OFDM) in which CP-OFDM techniques has been used instead of UW-OFDM. Although the FB-UW-OFDM system has the same bandwidth efficiency of FB-CP-OFDM, as computer simulation shows, it has better performance. Moreover, employing UW-OFDM provides the possibility of channel estimation and synchronization due to using a deterministic unique word in FB-UW-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146263","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146263.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO filter-bank multicarrier system using unique word OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146263/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO filter-bank multicarrier system using unique word OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286765","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146263/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO filter-bank multicarrier system using unique word OFDM","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055985S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146273,"authors":[{"name":"Javane Rostampoor","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Javane","lastName":"Rostampoor","id":"37085452584"},{"name":"S.

The cooperation part of this study consists of a single amplify and forward (AF) two-way relay node equipped with multiple antennas. In order to compare the efficiency of the proposed schemes, energy efficiency (EE) is defined as the ratio of total bits of transmitted data to the total amount of consumed energy. In the first scenario, transceivers precoders are designed based on EE-maximization under some constraints on the transmit power of each node and quality of service (QoS) guarantee. The second scenario introduces an energy efficient precoder design at the transceiver nodes which maximizes total sum-rate under transmit power and QoS constraints. Additionally, an appropriate relay precoder matrix is designed in order to eliminate self-interference by applying zero-forcing (ZF) criterion in both scenarios. Two alternating algorithms are proposed to optimize transceivers and relay precoder matrices simultaneously. Simulation results are provided in order to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed schemes which imply the efficiency of EE-maximization method.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146273","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146273.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency and sum-rate maximization in MIMO two-way relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146273/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency and sum-rate maximization in MIMO two-way relay networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286844","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146273/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency and sum-rate maximization in MIMO two-way relay networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Communications341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090928S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146280,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Hossein Hadjahmadi","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Tehran, IR"],"firstName":"Amir Hossein","lastName":"Hadjahmadi","id":"37698172700"},{"name":"Mohammad Mehdi Homayounpour","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Tehran, IR"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mehdi","lastName":"Homayounpour","id":"37298865800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146280","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Electrical engineering","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data visualisation","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","Monte Carlo methods","neural nets","transforms","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertainty propagation","bottleneck features","machine learning system","data visualization","nonlinear transforms","Gaussian approximation","auto-encoders neural networks","Monte-Carlo method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Uncertainty Propagation","Bottleneck Features","Neural Network","Unscented Transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146280","abstract":"Any real world data will have some degree of uncertainty, coping with such uncertainty is one of the most important challenges faced by any Machine Learning system. Transforming the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions has a long history as a method for data visualization, and for extracting key low dimensional features. Recently, the nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, have shown surprising results. But propagating uncertainty of input data through such nonlinear transforms is a difficult and important problem. In this paper, we use a Gaussian approximation by unscented transform to propagate the uncertainty in input data through auto-encoders neural networks. Unscented transform is easier to implement than classic Monte-Carlo method and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. Moreover, we extract an approximate of uncertainty of bottleneck features. The performance of the proposed method is visualized graphically and also evaluated on a small speaker recognition task. The results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method for propagating uncertainties of inputs through bottleneck features in the performance of classification task.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146280","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146280.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty propagation through neural network bottleneck features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146280/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty propagation through neural network bottleneck features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146280/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15286797","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty propagation through neural network bottleneck features","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Computer021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058083S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7146291,"authors":[{"name":"Elham Parhizkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Parhizkar","id":"37085572149"},{"name":"Mahdi Abadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Abadi","id":"37863276700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146291","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Electrical engineering","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","optimisation","sensor fusion","support vector machines","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["false alarm rate","multiple one-class classifier fusion","BeeSnips","binary artificial bee colony algorithm","one-class SVM classifier ensemble approach","anomaly detection system","web-based security attack","Web traffic","OC-WAD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","web-based attack","artificial bee colony algorithm","one-class classifier","classifier ensemble"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, web-based attacks have made up a substantial portion of all security attacks because web-based vulnerabilities are so common and so easy to exploit. To counter these attacks, many anomaly detection systems have been proposed that are able to detect both known and unknown attacks launched against web-based applications. However, most of them suffer from a large number of false alarms. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting OC-WAD, a novel approach to construct an ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers for anomaly detection in web traffic. OC-WAD uses a novel binary artificial bee colony algorithm, called BeeSnips, to prune the initial ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers and to find a near-optimal sub-ensemble. It is motivated by the observation that the fusion of multiple one-class classifiers can considerably decrease the false alarm rate without a significant change in the detection rate. The results of experiments carried out on a real dataset show that OC-WAD can detect web-based attacks with a high detection rate and an acceptable false alarm rate.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146291","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146291.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OC-WAD: A one-class classifier ensemble approach for anomaly detection in web traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146291/","displayDocTitle":"OC-WAD: A one-class classifier ensemble approach for anomaly detection in web traffic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286784","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146291/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OC-WAD: A one-class classifier ensemble approach for anomaly detection in web traffic","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Computer078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087158S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146294,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser Shami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Shami","id":"37085481524"},{"name":"Mehdi Rasti","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Rasti","id":"37683692900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1971-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"7146294","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrical engineering","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","heuristic programming","integer programming","nonlinear programming","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency scheduling scheme","cognitive radio networks","CRN","operation-modes scheduling","cognitive base-station","secondary users","nonlinear integer programming","polynomial time heuristic algorithm","channel switching bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency assignment","cognitive radio network","dynamic spectrum management","energy efficiency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficiency scheduling scheme for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146294","startPage":"648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146294","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on operation-modes scheduling in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), in which a cognitive base-station assigns available frequencies to secondary users (SUs). This is formally stated as the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency (defined as the ratio of the total rate of SUs to total energy consumption), which is a nonlinear integer programming, and then present a polynomial time heuristic algorithm to address it. In contrast to existing schemes, in our proposed scheme, the SUs, who do not have any data to transmit or no frequency is assigned to them, transit into the sleep-mode. This would significantly reduce the energy consumption. Furthermore, since SUs consume significant energy during the channel switching, depending on the difference between frequencies of current and new assigned frequencies (i.e, channel switching bandwidth), in our proposed scheme, a new frequency is assigned to SUs if it is at the vicinity of the current frequency. This results in decreased channel switching bandwidth for SUs (which in turn results in decreased energy consumption) and lowered computational overhead. Our simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms existing scheduling algorithms for CRNs in terms of energy consumption and the channel switching bandwidth for SUs, without reducing the throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15286778","htmlLink":"/document/7146294/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficiency scheduling scheme for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficiency scheduling scheme for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Computer088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063845S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146308,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Ranjbar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical, Computer, and IT, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Ranjbar","id":"37085392343"},{"name":"Mostafa Ersali Salehi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Science (IPM), Tehran, Iran","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mostafa Ersali","lastName":"Salehi","id":"37300562700"},{"name":"M.

However, edge detection algorithms are computation intensive, usually complex to implement, and also sensitive to the noises in the internal circuits. Considering image processing algorithms in robotic, the power limitations of their embedded systems have encouraged designers toward stochastic computing. In this paper, we propose three novel stochastic architectures for three well-known \u201cedge detection algorithms\u201d. Our experimental results show that the proposed architectures require less area and also they consume less power. Furthermore, to handle the long processing time of producing accurate stochastic outputs we propose novel solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146308.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using stochastic architectures for edge detection algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes","Multiplexing","Hardware","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","fault tolerance","image processing","object detection","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic architectures","edge detection algorithms","image preprocessing","object detection","stochastic computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge detection","Fault tolerant","Image processing","Stochastic architectures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Using stochastic architectures for edge detection algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146308/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286618","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using stochastic architectures for edge detection algorithms","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Computer140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043855S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146311,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Afianian","affiliation":["International campus, Kharazmi University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Afianian","id":"37085576094"},{"name":"S.

Trust relations always have been one of the key factors in designing a security architecture for outsourcing data in mobile cloud computing in order to offload some of the computation overhead like pre-encryptions to a third trusted party which in practical environment it is not a wise idea, especially when we have a security sensitive data. In this paper, we present a method to improve Rabin's IDA to further be used for secure dispersal of information by employing a lightweight energy-efficient pre-processing phase before application of the IDA. In the pre-processing phase, we produce a cipher key using a selfie picture taken by the user. Further we employ a method of key management such that in case of missing one file, there would be no way of reconstructing the file while relieving the user from key management complexities. Due to our method's low-energy consuming nature, it can be confidently used in mobile cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146311.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"745","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient secure distributed storage in mobile cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Electrical engineering","Conferences","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","mobile computing","storage management","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient secure distributed storage","mobile cloud computing","outsourced data confidentiality","outsourced data integrity","trust relations","preencryptions","third trusted party","Rabin IDA","information dispersal algorithm","cipher key","selfie picture","key management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secure storage","Mobile cloud","Energy-efficient","Stream Cipher","Distributed storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient secure distributed storage in mobile cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146311/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15286885","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient secure distributed storage in mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Computer151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123512S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146346,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

As the last part of this paper, position control of quadrotor based on the nonlinear dynamic model is designed using feedback linearization approach, which its combination with proposed sliding mode control or backstepping control gives full control of quadrotor.

This is because there is a trade-off between linearity of a PA and its efficiency. This can be a bottleneck in many of modern wireless systems especially those are to be designed for transmission of non-constant envelope signals. This paper presents an efficient predistortion method based on digital baseband injection of appropriate signals to the input to lower the Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) parameter. A mathematical method is given to describe the nonlinear relationship between input and output of the PA The optimum values for the injection signals at the intermodulation frequencies are obtained. In comparison with previous works, the proposed method is relatively low cost and high efficient. Simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of remarkably reducing spectral regrowth in adjacent channels for different non-constant envelope signals.

The post-simulation results shows that the proposed OTA has a 46.4 dB DC gain, a 14.5 MHz gain bandwidth (GBW) and a 85\u00b0 phase margin for 2 PF capacitive loads. The proposed OTA achieved 110.1 dB CMRR. The OTA consumes only 28.6 \u03bcW under a 1.2 V single supply voltage and occupies a very small area of 33 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22125</sup>\n mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

This algorithm reduces switching on read bit-lines by reversible conversion on pattern of input data without any reduction in memory capacity, and decreases write failure and write delay for normally distributed data. An 8T SRAM cell from our previous work was used in the SRAM block. Due to single ended read operation in our cell, an external circuit is posited to increase the number of \"1\"s at storage nodes. According to sign-bit of input data, the decision is made about how data should be saved to increase the number of \"0\"s at left internal nodes of SRAM cells that is equal to storing \"1\" at right internal nodes. To verify the proposed design, a 64\u00d716 SRAM array without external circuits is simulated in 90nm industrial CMOS technology at different supply voltages (typical corner, T=27\u00b0C). Simulation results show that power reduction for any normal data distribution depends on standard deviation of data.

In this paper, a new method for tracking the global MPP under partially shaded conditions using neural network is proposed in which instead of measuring light intensity, the network approximates it. For this purpose, at first by measuring the voltage, current and temperature of panels we estimate the radiation intensity and then a neural network is trained using radiation intensity and temperature of panels as inputs and MPP as output of the network. Finally, this method is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment and results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146447","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128762/7146167/07146447.pdf","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1445","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","publicationTitle":"2015 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based global maximum power point tracking under partially shaded conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based global maximum power point tracking under partially shaded conditions","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15286779","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146447/","conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based global maximum power point tracking under partially shaded conditions","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICEE2015Power005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144083S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128762","isNumber":"7146167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128762","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7146167","articleId":"7146447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7146452,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An adaptive notch filter (ANF) was used as a current estimator which can separate needed current components.

Unfortunately, power consumption of accelerometers becomes a bottleneck for realising pervasive self-powering HAR as the amount of power that can be practically harvested from the environment is very small. Instead of using accelerometer, this paper advocates the use of energy harvesting power signal as the source of HAR when motion (kinetic) energy is being harvested to power the device. The proposed use of harvested power for classifying human activities is motivated by the fact that different activities produce kinetic energy in a different way leaving their signatures in the harvested power signal. Using information theoretic analysis of experimental data, we show that many standard statistical features provide significant information gain when the kinetic power signal is used for discriminating between different activities, confirming its potential use for HAR. We have evaluated activity recognition accuracy for kinetic power signal based HAR using 14 different sets of common activities each containing between 2-10 different activities to be classified. HAR accuracies varied between 68% to 100% depending on the set of activities. The average accuracy over all activity sets is 83%, which is within 13% of what could be achieved with an accelerometer without any power constraints.","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2015.7146512","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120793/7146496/07146512.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2015.7146512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pervasive self-powered human activity recognition without the accelerometer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146512/","displayDocTitle":"Pervasive self-powered human activity recognition without the accelerometer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15277787","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146512/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pervasive self-powered human activity recognition without the accelerometer","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p79khalifa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107658S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120793","isNumber":"7146496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120793","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7146496","articleId":"7146512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146519,"authors":[{"name":"Ruth Ravichandran","affiliation":["University Of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"firstName":"Ruth","lastName":"Ravichandran","id":"37085534163"},{"name":"Elliot Saba","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"firstName":"Elliot","lastName":"Saba"},{"name":"Ke-Yu Chen","affiliation":["University Of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"firstName":"Ke-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085505821"},{"name":"Mayank Goel","affiliation":["University Of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Goel","id":"37085536093"},{"name":"Sidhant Gupta","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, US"],"firstName":"Sidhant","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38195224100"},{"name":"Shwetak N.

In this paper, we present WiBreathe, a wireless, high fidelity and non-invasive breathing monitor that leverages wireless signals at 2.4 GHz to estimate an individual's respiration rate. Our work extends past approaches of using wireless signals for respiratory monitoring by using only a single transmitter-receiver pair at the same frequency range of commodity Wi-Fi signals to estimate the respiratory rate of an individual. This is done irrespective of whether they are in line of sight or not (e.g., through walls). Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of WiBreathe in detecting multiple people and by extension, their respiration rates. We evaluate our approach in various natural environments and show that we can track breathing with the accuracy of 1.54 breaths per minute when compared to a clinical respiratory chest band.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15277783","htmlLink":"/document/7146519/","conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"WiBreathe: Estimating respiration rate using wireless signals in natural settings in the home","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiBreathe: Estimating respiration rate using wireless signals in natural settings in the home","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p131ravichandran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053668S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120793","isNumber":"7146496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120793","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7146496","articleId":"7146519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":7146528,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Micallef","affiliation":["Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, Scotland"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Micallef","id":"37085505429"},{"name":"Hilmi G\u00fcne\u015f Kayac\u0131k","affiliation":["FICO, San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Hilmi G\u00fcne\u015f","lastName":"Kayac\u0131k","id":"37267986100"},{"name":"Mike Just","affiliation":["Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Just","id":"38245075900"},{"name":"Lynne Baillie","affiliation":["Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, Scotland"],"firstName":"Lynne","lastName":"Baillie","id":"37282988600"},{"name":"David Aspinall","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Aspinall","id":"38546558800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8033-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7146528","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Authentication","Mobile handsets","Global Positioning System","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message authentication","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven authentication","mobile devices","battery consumption","sensor effectiveness","adaptive sampling technique","sampling rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146528","doi":"10.1109/PERCOM.2015.7146528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PERCOM.2015.7146528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146496","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7120793/7146496/07146528.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor use and usefulness: Trade-offs for data-driven authentication on mobile devices","abstract":"Modern mobile devices come with an array of sensors that support many interesting applications. However, sensors have different sampling costs (e.g., battery drain) and benefits (e.g., accuracy) under different circumstances. In this work we investigate the trade-off between the cost of using a sensor and the benefit gained from its use, with application to data-driven authentication on mobile devices. Current authentication practice, where user behaviour is first learned from the sensor data and then used to detect anomalies, typically assumes a fixed sampling rate and does not consider the battery consumption and usefulness of sensors. In this work we study how battery consumption and sensor effectiveness (e.g., for detecting attacks) vary when using different sensors and different sensor sampling rates. We use data from both controlled lab studies, as well as field trials, for our experiments. We also propose an adaptive sampling technique that adjusts the sampling rate based on an expected device vigilance level. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the battery consumption tenfold without significantly impacting the detection of attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 March 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146528/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15277813","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensor use and usefulness: Trade-offs for data-driven authentication on mobile devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor use and usefulness: Trade-offs for data-driven authentication on mobile devices","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p189micallef.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083367S","chronDate":"23-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7120793","isNumber":"7146496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7120793","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7146496","articleId":"7146528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7146618,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Antonietti","affiliation":["Dept.

In this work we have defined a realistic cerebellar model through the use of artificial spiking neural networks, testing it in computational simulations reproducing the eye blinking classical conditioning in multiple sessions of acquisition and extinction. We used two models: one with only the cortical plasticity and another with three plasticity sites, one plasticity at cortical level and two at nuclear level. We have compared the behavioral outcome of the two different models and proved that the model with a distributed plasticity produces a faster and more stable acquisition of conditioned responses in the reacquisition phase with respect to the single plasticity model. This behavior is explained by the effect of the nuclear plasticities, which have a slow dynamics and can express memory consolidation and savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15287194","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7146618/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spiking cerebellar model with multiple plasticity sites reproduces eye blinking classical conditioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking cerebellar model with multiple plasticity sites reproduces eye blinking classical conditioning","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"0880082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046169S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131936","isNumber":"7146535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131936","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7146535","articleId":"7146618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7146633,"authors":[{"name":"Maruan Al-Shedivat","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KSA"],"firstName":"Maruan","lastName":"Al-Shedivat","id":"37085360257"},{"name":"Rawan Naous","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KSA"],"firstName":"Rawan","lastName":"Naous","id":"37085369594"},{"name":"Emre Neftci","affiliation":["Institute for Neural Computation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Neftci","id":"37542722900"},{"name":"Gert Cauwenberghs","affiliation":["Institute for Neural Computation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gert","lastName":"Cauwenberghs","id":"37085354852"},{"name":"Khaled N.

We demonstrate that the switching of the memristor is akin to the stochastic firing of the SRM. Our analysis and simulations show that the proposed neuron circuit satisfies a neural computability condition that enables probabilistic neural sampling and spike-based Bayesian learning and inference.

This system does not only detect spikes from a neural signal but also can compress this neural signal with a high compression rate. In the compression part, due to the fact that neural signals are not sparse in the time domain, we designed a sensing matrix, called Minimum Euclidean or Manhattan Distance Cluster-based (MDC) matrix, to compress neural signals. Using this MDC matrix and a novel reconstruction algorithm, we achieve a compression rate which can be up to 90% with the reconstruction error being around 0.2. Moreover, the proposed system has relatively low power consumption (0.59 mW) and a small chip area (7 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131936/7146535/07146693.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"600","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)","doi":"10.1109/NER.2015.7146693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NER.2015.7146693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High compression rate and efficient spikes detection system using compressed sensing technique for neural signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Neural engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","power consumption","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high compression rate","spike detection system","compressed sensing technique","neural signal processing","digital neural signal compression","time domain","Minimum Euclidean cluster-based matrix","Manhattan distance cluster-based matrix","MDC matrix","reconstruction algorithm","reconstruction error","power consumption","small chip area","root-mean-square method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"High compression rate and efficient spikes detection system using compressed sensing technique for neural signal processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146693/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15287219","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High compression rate and efficient spikes detection system using compressed sensing technique for neural signal processing","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"2310386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046953S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131936","isNumber":"7146535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131936","xplore-issue":"7146535","articleId":"7146693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146937,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym Musiyenko","affiliation":["Department of Information Technologies and Software Systems, Petro Mohyla Black Sea State University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Maksym","lastName":"Musiyenko","id":"37085533001"},{"name":"Yaroslav Krainyk","affiliation":["Department of Information Technologies and Software Systems, Petro Mohyla Black Sea State University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Krainyk","id":"37085545561"},{"name":"Oleksii Denysov","affiliation":["Department of Information Technologies and Software Systems, Petro Mohyla Black Sea State University, Mykolaiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleksii","lastName":"Denysov","id":"37085528032"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6534-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7146937","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Iterative decoding","Indexes","Field programmable gate arrays","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiport networks","parallel processing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable decoder","irregular random low density parity check matrix","FPGA","partially parallel reconfigurable LDPC decoder","irregular random parity check matrix","quad port memory","two port memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","FPGA","decoding unit","processing","throughput","parity check matrix","memory"]}],"abstract":"Method for design of partially parallel reconfigurable LDPC-decoder based on FPGA is presented in the paper.

Although said techniques can help to extract the cardiac component from a mixture of input sources, permutation indeterminacy inherit to BSS techniques often introduces inaccuracies or requires manual intervention. The current contribution focuses on methods to automatically select the cardiac component from the output of BSS techniques applied to camera-based photoplethysmograms. To that end, we propose simple Markov models to describe and subsequently identify cardiac components. It is shown that good results can be obtained by combining different simple Markov models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated identification of cardiac signals after blind source separation for camera-based photoplethysmography","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Electronics and Nanotechnology (ELNANO)","doi":"10.1109/ELNANO.2015.7146950","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Electronics and Nanotechnology (ELNANO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7132533/7146825/07146950.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELNANO.2015.7146950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7146950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7146950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Automated identification of cardiac signals after blind source separation for camera-based photoplethysmography","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7146950/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15287324","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated identification of cardiac signals after blind source separation for camera-based photoplethysmography","confLoc":"Kyiv, UKraine","sourcePdf":"PID3704535422427108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099354S","chronDate":"21-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7132533","isNumber":"7146825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7132533","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7146825","articleId":"7146950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7146963,"authors":[{"name":"Atabak Najafi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Gazi University Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Atabak","lastName":"Najafi","id":"38581116100"},{"name":"Ires Iskender","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Gazi University Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ires","lastName":"Iskender","id":"37670703200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7103-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7102-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7146963","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"abstract":"The major challenges of transformer designers are high loss evaluation, high reliability, low cost and weight requirements.

The results of experiments make it possible to conclude that proposed neural tuner helps to achieve at least 3% and 5% decrease of time amount and energy consumption respectively in comparison with a conventional PI-controller.","doi":"10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147053","pdfPath":"/iel7/7133660/7146959/07147053.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On applying neural tuner to PI-controller parameters calculation for heating furnaces control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On applying neural tuner to PI-controller parameters calculation for heating furnaces control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287747","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147053/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On applying neural tuner to PI-controller parameters calculation for heating furnaces control","confLoc":"Omsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"122up.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108649S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7133660","isNumber":"7146959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7133660","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7146959","articleId":"7147053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147055,"authors":[{"name":"E.V.

In order to apply the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for power switching applications the normally off operation is required. Enhancement type behavior of GaN HEMT transistors is obtained by using p-type Mg-doped GaN gate structures. The optimized epitaxial designs enable threshold voltage close to +2V. In present work, it is shown that atomic hydrogen treatment of the Mg doped p-GaN before gate metal evaporation can increase the threshold voltage up to +3.5V. It can be caused by the hydrogen-induced dipole layer formation at the p-GaN semiconductor interface after atomic hydrogen treatment. Further increase of treatment time lead to reduce the threshold voltage by form neutral complexes. Neutral complexes reduce the Mg doping level of p-GaN layer. There was no visible parameters degradation after thermal annealing at T = 300 \u00b0C for t = 30 min in vacuum environment. It can be caused by the formation thermally stable Mg-H complexes in the p-GaN layer after hydrogenation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7133660/7146959/07147055.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","doi":"10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High threshold voltage p-gate GaN transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Hydrogen","Threshold voltage","Atomic layer deposition","Transistors","Wide band gap semiconductors","Aluminum gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","annealing","doping profiles","evaporation","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","magnesium","power semiconductor switches","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vacuum environment","thermal annealing","Mg doping level","neutral complex","p-GaN semiconductor interface","hydrogen-induced dipole layer formation","gate metal evaporation","atomic hydrogen treatment","optimized epitaxial designs","p-type Mg-doped GaN gate structures","power switching applications","critical electric field","breakdown voltage","2DEG channels","carrier mobility","AlGaN-GaN HEMT","threshold voltage","p-gate GaN transistors","temperature 300 degC","time 30 min","AlGaN-GaN","GaN:Mg"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaN transistor","p-GaN","threshold voltage","atomic hydrogen"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"High threshold voltage p-gate GaN transistors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15287594","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High threshold voltage p-gate GaN transistors","confLoc":"Omsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"124pp.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044759S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7133660","isNumber":"7146959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7133660","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7146959","articleId":"7147055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147071,"authors":[{"name":"I.V.

The reliability of such control systems is largely determined by the level of reliability of their software. The N-version programming has been one of the topical approaches to increase the reliability of the software. The N-version software is based on software redundancy that requires a larger amount of execution time. Satellite communications systems are real-time applications for which any increase in the software execution time is critical. Hu's scheduling algorithm is suggested for solving this task. The proposed approach allows for generation of an optimal execution schedule for versions of the N-version software of the control system of a satellite communications system. The schedule has the advantage of using a reduced time for task solving. The paper presents a solution to determination of the minimum execution time to run the N-version of the control system of a satellite communications system for a given number of processors. The paper shows a procedure for determination of the number of processors required in the minimum time for execution of a task flow.","doi":"10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147270","pdfPath":"/iel7/7133660/7146959/07147270.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7146959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hu's algorithm application for task scheduling in N-version software for satellite communications control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hu's algorithm application for task scheduling in N-version software for satellite communications control systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15287608","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147270/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hu's algorithm application for task scheduling in N-version software for satellite communications control systems","confLoc":"Omsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"408up.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049478S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7133660","isNumber":"7146959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7133660","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7146959","articleId":"7147270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7147326,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

However, not much work has been done which utilizes Cloud computing for providing pervasive healthcare information management services on mobile devices. This paper focus on the application of Mobile Cloud Computing in Care pathways, a set of tools for managing quality of care provided to patients by medical institutions. Care pathways started in 1980s with paper-based or form-based version. Nowadays, hospitals may use the electronic version which offer greater flexibility and integration with other parts of hospital systems, and helps in reducing medical errors. Mobile cloud computing has a great potential in facilitating Care pathways in this direction. Mobility can be utilized to improve communications between the various levels of Care pathways users, as well as convenient and secured access to medical records and data. In addition, cloud computing allows the offloading of complex resource scheduling or medical processing tasks to be performed remotely reducing computing energy and equipment cost incurred by medical institutions. In this paper, we propose the techniques to develop the Care pathways software based on Mobile cloud computing technologies, the required hardware infrastructure and software components, and propose a design architecture. The objective is to foster and provide systematic guidance on development of advanced Care pathways software.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference - (IHTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131918/7147511/07147518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference - (IHTC)","doi":"10.1109/IHTC.2014.7147518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHTC.2014.7147518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Mobile Cloud Computing in Care pathways","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Biomedical imaging","Medical services","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","electronic health records","health care","hospitals","mobile computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","care pathways","health-care services","pervasive healthcare information management services","hospitals","medical records","complex resource scheduling","medical processing tasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"Application of Mobile Cloud Computing in Care pathways","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147518/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"15260865","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"1-4 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Mobile Cloud Computing in Care pathways","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"1010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102725S","chronDate":"1-4 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7131918","isNumber":"7147511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131918","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7147511","articleId":"7147518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147521,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed O Abdul Salam","affiliation":["University of Bradford, School of Engineering, Design and Technology, Bradford, UK"],"firstName":"Ahmed O","lastName":"Abdul Salam","id":"37085353865"},{"name":"Saleh R.

The connection to such emergency backup network could be established on CR engines built in normal or dedicated smart phone handsets.","doi":"10.1109/IHTC.2014.7147521","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference - (IHTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131918/7147511/07147521.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHTC.2014.7147521","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference - (IHTC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general perspective on software-hardware defined cognitive radio based on emergency ad-hoc network topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 June 2014","displayDocTitle":"A general perspective on software-hardware defined cognitive radio based on emergency ad-hoc network topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147521/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"15260889","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"1-4 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general perspective on software-hardware defined cognitive radio based on emergency ad-hoc network topology","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"1022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067678S","chronDate":"1-4 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7131918","isNumber":"7147511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131918","xplore-issue":"7147511","articleId":"7147521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147535,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Makonin","affiliation":["Climate Action Secretariat, The Government of British Columbia","Computing Science and Technology, Simon Fraser University"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Makonin","id":"38547391900"},{"name":"Laura Guzman Flores","affiliation":["Climate Action Secretariat, The Government of British Columbia","Geography Technology, Simon Fraser University"],"firstName":"Laura Guzman","lastName":"Flores","id":"37085513661"},{"name":"Robyn Gill","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Robyn","lastName":"Gill","id":"37085502433"},{"name":"Roger Alex Clapp","affiliation":["Geography Technology, Simon Fraser University"],"firstName":"Roger Alex","lastName":"Clapp","id":"37085517225"},{"name":"Lyn Bartram","affiliation":["Interactive Arts Technology, Simon Fraser University"],"firstName":"Lyn","lastName":"Bartram","id":"37353447100"},{"name":"Bob Gill","affiliation":["School of Energy, British Columbia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Gill","id":"37071898400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3996-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3995-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7147535","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":595},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home appliances","Energy conservation","Smart meters","Standards","Monitoring","Government","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domestic appliances","electricity supply industry","energy conservation","government policies","power consumption","smart meters","socio-economic effects","sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["government policy","nonintrusive load monitoring","NILM","consumer bill of right","socio-economic balance","power utility","home smart meter","energy consumption monitoring","appliance power consumption","self-driven action","sustainable energy supply and demand","energy conservation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy policy","energy economics","smart meter","NILM","load disaggregation","appliance manufactures","standards"]}],"abstract":"Sustainable energy supply and demand can partially be solved by the conservation of energy, which is a personal and self-driven action. However, energy conservation currently requires the purchase of third-party products. The upfront cost of purchasing these products to monitor energy consumption in a home is a barrier that further cements the divide of those that have and those that have not. Detailed appliance power consumption reporting should be made available for free as part of the home's smart meter. Governments and power utilities must improve and expand policies that promote a socio-economic balance allowing everyone to participate in energy conservation regardless of their economic situation in a sustained way. We critically look at what economics and government polices exist and need to exist. We also demonstrate the computational means to achieve this - nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) - and discuss how manufacturing and standards organizations need to work together to provide the essential information that describes how appliances consume energy.

The non-Gaussian nature of this interference provides an opportunity for its effective mitigation by nonlinear filtering. In this paper, we introduce blind adaptive analog nonlinear filters, referred to as Adaptive Nonlinear Differential Limiters (ANDLs), that are characterized by several methodological distinctions from the existing digital solutions. When ANDLs are incorporated into a communications receiver, these methodological differences can translate into significant practical advantages, improving the receiver performance in the presence of non-Gaussian interference. A Nonlinear Differential Limiter (NDL) is obtained from a linear analog filter by introducing an appropriately chosen feedback-based nonlinearity into the response of the filter, and the degree of nonlinearity is controlled by a single parameter. ANDLs are similarly controlled by a single parameter, and are suitable for improving quality of non-stationary signals under time-varying noise conditions. ANDLs are designed to be fully compatible with existing linear devices and systems (i.e., ANDLs' behavior is linear in the absence of impulsive interference), and to be used as an enhancement, or as a simple low-cost alternative, to the state-of-art interference mitigation methods. We provide an introduction to the NDLs and illustrate their potential use for noise mitigation in PLC systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive analog nonlinear filters for noise mitigation in powerline communication systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147580","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128767/7147572/07147580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive analog nonlinear filters for noise mitigation in powerline communication systems","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147580/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15260835","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive analog nonlinear filters for noise mitigation in powerline communication systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1570075535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0783S","chronDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128767","isNumber":"7147572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128767","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7147572","articleId":"7147580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147581,"authors":[{"name":"Aashish Mathur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Aashish","lastName":"Mathur","id":"37085401992"},{"name":"Manav R.

In this paper, we derive the condition for optimum detection of quadrature phase shift keying signals over Nakagami-m distributed additive background noise in power line communication system. The probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the decision variables for the real part and imaginary part of the background noise are derived. We use the copula approach to model the dependence among the decision variables. The analytical average symbol error rate and average bit error rate of the PLC system is numerically computed.

The efficiency of this method, however, is found to be not only impacted by the threshold selection but also by the average peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) value of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. As such, the blanking capability can be further enhanced by reducing the PAPR value. With this in mind, in this paper we evaluate the performance of constant envelope OFDM (CE-OFDM) which has inherently the lowest achievable PAPR of 0 dB; therefore, the proposed system is expected to provide the lower bound performance of the blanking-based method. In order to characterize system performance, we consider the probability of blanking error and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the blanking device. The results reveal that the proposed system can achieve significant improvements over the conventional OFDM blanking-based scheme in terms of minimized probability of blanking error. It will also be shown that output SNR gains of up to 6 dB can be attained over the conventional OFDM blanking-based systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147582","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128767/7147572/07147582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147572","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant envelope OFDM transmission over impulsive noise power-line communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constant envelope OFDM transmission over impulsive noise power-line communication channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147582/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15260812","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant envelope OFDM transmission over impulsive noise power-line communication channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1570064807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056522S","chronDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128767","isNumber":"7147572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128767","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7147572","articleId":"7147582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147583,"authors":[{"name":"Tarkesh Pande","affiliation":["Embedded Processing Systems Research and Development, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX"],"firstName":"Tarkesh","lastName":"Pande","id":"37296595700"},{"name":"Il Han Kim","affiliation":["Embedded Processing Systems Research and Development, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX"],"firstName":"Il Han","lastName":"Kim","id":"37067861000"},{"name":"Anuj Batra","affiliation":["Embedded Processing Systems Research and Development, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX"],"firstName":"Anuj","lastName":"Batra","id":"37265744100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8413-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7147583","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Narrowband","Frequency estimation","Interference cancellation","Bit error rate","Power line communications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","frequency estimation","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband power-line communication systems","OFDM","narrowband interference","switching power supplies","legacy communication systems","NBI spectral leakage","intercarrier interference","NBI effect","NBI frequency estimator","combined receiver solution","AWGN performance","G3-FCC standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Narrowband Interference","Frequency Offset Estimation","Intentional Inter-carrier Interference","Nyquist Window","OFDM","Nulling"]}],"abstract":"Current generation narrowband power-line communication systems are OFDM based.

First, the performance of polar codes in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulsive noise channels will be shown. In addition, a signal level limiter is used to mitigate the degradation of the performance over the impulse noise channels. Thereafter, the performance over real PLC channels is investigated. Simulation results show that polar codes are applicable to PLC channels with lower complexity than a turbo or a LDPC code.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Bit error rate","Decoding","Parity check codes","Binary phase shift keying","Complexity theory","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","carrier transmission on power lines","decoding","error correction codes","error statistics","impulse noise","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar codes","successive cancellation decoding","power line communication channel","PLC channel","error correcting codes","ECC","turbo codes","low density parity check codes","LDPC codes","bit error rate","BER","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","impulsive noise channels","signal level limiter","impulse noise channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communication (PLC)","Impulsive noise channel","Bit error rate (BER)","Polar code","Successive cancellation (SC) decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147584","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147584","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128767/7147572/07147584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147584","startPage":"24","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147572","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of polar codes with successive cancellation decoding over PLC channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of polar codes with successive cancellation decoding over PLC channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147584/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147584/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15260833","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of polar codes with successive cancellation decoding over PLC channels","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1570063443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065857S","chronDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128767","isNumber":"7147572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128767","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7147572","articleId":"7147584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7147590,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Weling","affiliation":["Devolo AG, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Weling","id":"37640397200"},{"name":"Andreas Engelen","affiliation":["Devolo AG, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Engelen","id":"37085475347"},{"name":"Stephan Thiel","affiliation":["Devolo AG, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Thiel","id":"37085463732"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8413-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7147590","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Frequency modulation","Modems","Noise","MIMO","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband MIMO powerline channel emulator verification","FPGA","PLC channel emulator","PLC modem performance","broadband powerline modems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power line communications (PLC)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Automatic Test Equipment (ATE)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Arbitrary Noise Generator","Broadband","Channel","Noise","Emulator","Simulator","HomePlug","devolo"]}],"abstract":"We have designed an FPGA based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) power line communications (PLC) Channel Emulator in our research lab over the last years.

In particular, we consider different MIMO PLC networks to study the feasibility of IA as well as evaluate the performance in terms of sum-rate for these setups. To this end, we exploit minimum interference leakage (Min-IL) and maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio (Max-SINR) algorithms that were earlier proposed for IA in the context of MIMO wireless interference networks. Our results show that IA can be equally applicable to the MIMO PLC in interference scenarios as well as the sum-rate of the PLC networks can be significantly improved through the exploitation of Max-SINR algorithm.

By assuming each endpoint of the grid is equipped with a PLC device, we model the grid as an edge-node network with tree structure. Then, considering the parametric sparsity of the PLC channel, we propose a method to estimate the distances between nodes using Bayesian compressed sensing (CS).

Especially for the study of PLC networks, the so-called bottom-up channel emulation using transmission-line theory (TLT) is the proper method. The underlying assumption of this approach is that the power line propagation characteristics are known. That is, the per-unit length (PUL) parameters of the power lines need to be computed. However, especially for multi-conductor lines this can be theoretically and computationally challenging. In this paper, we present a compact overview of the computation of PUL parameters. We briefly discuss the assumptions associated with different solution methods and develop a numerical solver applicable to general multi-conductor transmission lines. Considering a sample set of different cable types, we demonstrate the effects of simplifying assumptions on the accuracy of computed PUL parameters and channel frequency responses.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications (ISPLC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128767/7147572/07147610.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On PLC channel emulation via transmission line theory","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7147572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2015.7147610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"On PLC channel emulation via transmission line theory","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15260819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 March-1 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147610/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On PLC channel emulation via transmission line theory","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1570063109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065493S","chronDate":"March 29 2015-April 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128767","isNumber":"7147572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128767","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7147572","articleId":"7147610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147611,"authors":[{"name":"Thiago R.

In particular, there is an underlying gain that could be achieved by leveraging the existing ubiquitous power line network infrastructure to render connectivity, while we also exploit the illumination system of power-saving Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for wireless data communication.

Compared to lower frequency bands, propagation in the 38 GHz band is relatively unexplored for access networks in urban scenarios. This paper presents a detailed measurement-based analysis of urban outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor propagation characteristics at 38 GHz. Different sets of measurements were performed in order to understand, quantify and model the behavior of the different underlying propagation mechanisms. The study considers line-of-sight propagation, reflection, scattering, diffraction, transmission, as well as polarization effects. The measurement results confirm that, at this particular frequency, propagation in urban scenarios is mainly driven by line-of-sight and reflection. The proposed models are practical for implementation in system level simulators or ray-tracing tools. The different observations presented along the paper are useful for future radio network planning considerations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of 38 GHz mmWave Propagation Characteristics of Urban Scenarios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of 38 GHz mmWave Propagation Characteristics of Urban Scenarios","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"563976062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028677S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","isNumber":"7147659","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7147658","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7147721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7147730,"authors":[{"name":"David Szabo","affiliation":["Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Szabo"},{"name":"Andras Gulyas","affiliation":["MTA-BME Information systems research group"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Gulyas"},{"name":"Frank H.

Thus, an architecture built around network coding may be a feasible road towards realizing the tactile internet vision. Our contribution is threefold: (i) we show how network coding improves latency and reduces packet re-transmission with respect to other coding schemes analytically, (ii) we present our implementation of a network coding capable software router and support our analytical results with realistic measurements, and (iii) we show that, in contrast with current packet-switched networks, network coding can be seamlessly integrated in Software Defined Networks (SDN) using our software router as a Virtual Network Function. Such combination of network coding and SDN summons a codecentric networking architecture that can be a promising host to future 5G systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards the Tactile Internet: Decreasing Communication Latency with Network Coding and Software Defined Networking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards the Tactile Internet: Decreasing Communication Latency with Network Coding and Software Defined Networking","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"563976071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020223S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2015","isNumber":"7147659","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7147658","citationCount":"3","articleId":"7147730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7147771,"authors":[{"name":"Atri Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["G S Sanyal School of Telecommunications, Indian Institiute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"bio":{"p":["Atri Mukhopadhyay received the M.Tech. degree in distributed and\n mobile computing from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.

Specifically, a mobile user equipment (TIE) transmits in D2D mode if the received signal strength (RSS) from the nearest base station (BS) is less than a specified threshold \u03b2 \u2265 0; otherwise, it connects to the nearest BS and transmits in cellular mode. The RSS-threshold-based setting is general in the sense that by varying \u03b2 from \u03b2 = 0 to \u03b2 = \u221e, the network accordingly evolves from a traditional cellular network (including only cellular mode) toward a wireless ad hoc network (including only D2D mode). We provide a unified framework to analyze the downlink outage probability in a multichannel environment with Rayleigh fading, where the spatial distributions of BSs and TIEs are well explicitly accounted for by utilizing stochastic geometry. We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of a generic TIE and that in both cellular mode and D2D mode and quantify the performance gains in outage probability that can be obtained by allowing such RSS-thresholdbased D2D communications. We show that increasing the number of channels, although able to support more cellular TIEs, may result in an increase of outage probability in the D2D-enabled cellular network. The corresponding condition and reason are also identified by applying our framework.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452492","startPage":"163","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07147772.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Outage Probability of Device-to-Device-Communication-Enabled Multichannel Cellular Networks: An RSS-Threshold-Based Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the Outage Probability of Device-to-Device-Communication-Enabled Multichannel Cellular Networks: An RSS-Threshold-Based Perspective","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15663080","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7147772/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002770","fundingName":"Cabinet Office, Japan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372073, 61373043, 61202394, 61472367 and 61432015"},{"fundingName":"Key Program of and NSFC-Guangdong Union Foundation","grantNumber":"U1135002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Outage Probability of Device-to-Device-Communication-Enabled Multichannel Cellular Networks: An RSS-Threshold-Based Perspective","sourcePdf":"jsac-liu-2452492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106572S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7358196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"7358196","articleId":"7147772","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7147774,"authors":[{"name":"Min Lin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7358196/7147774/lin-2452491-small.gif","p":["\n\nMin Lin (M'13) received the B.S. degree from National University of \nDefense Technology, Changsa, China, in 1993, the M.S. degree from Nanjing Institute of Communication Engineering, \nNanjing, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, in 2008, all in electrical \nengineering.

The corresponding performance analysis of FSO systems over turbulence channels is very limited, particularly when using multiple apertures at both transmitter and receiver sides. This paper aims to provide the ergodic capacity characterization of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems over atmospheric turbulence-induced fading channels. The fluctuations of the irradiance of optical channels distorted by atmospheric conditions is usually described by a gamma-gamma (rr) distribution, and the distribution of the sum of rr random variables (RVs) is required to model the MIMO optical links. We use an \u03b1 - \u03bc distribution to efficiently approximate the probability density function (pdf) of the sum of independent and identical distributed \u0393\u0393 RVs through moment-based estimators. Furthermore, the pdf of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed \u0393\u0393 RVs can be efficiently approximated by a finite weighted sum of pdfs of \u0393\u0393 distributions. Based on these reliable approximations, novel and precise analytical expressions for the ergodic capacity of MIMO FSO systems are derived. Additionally, we deduce the asymptotic simple expressions in high signal-to-noise ratio regimes, which provide useful insights into the impact of the system parameters on the ergodic capacity. Finally, our proposed results are validated via Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7206775/07147776.pdf","startPage":"1925","endPage":"1934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Ergodic Capacity of MIMO Free-Space Optical Systems Over Turbulence Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147776/","displayDocTitle":"On the Ergodic Capacity of MIMO Free-Space Optical Systems Over Turbulence Channels","volume":"33","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15381766","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147776/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2015DFG12760)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201185 and 61271266"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M560081"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Ergodic Capacity of MIMO Free-Space Optical Systems Over Turbulence Channels","sourcePdf":"jsac-dai-2452631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126143S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7206775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7206775","articleId":"7147776","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7147778,"authors":[{"name":"Guoru Ding","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7358196/7147778/ding-2452532-small.gif","p":["\n\nGuoru Ding (S'10\u2013M'14) received the B.S. degree in electrical \nengineering from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems \nfrom College of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

The goal is to build a location-specific TVWS database, which provides a lookup table service for any D2D link to determine its maximum permitted emission power (MPEP) in an unlicensed digital TV (DTV) band. To achieve this goal, the idea of mobile crowd sensing is first introduced to collect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices. Considering the incompleteness of crowd measurements, we formulate the problem of unknown measurements recovery as a matrix completion problem and apply a powerful fixed point continuation algorithm to reconstruct the unknown elements from the known elements. By joint exploitation of the big spectrum data in its vicinity, each cellular base station further implements a nonlinear support vector machine algorithm to perform irregular coverage boundary detection of a licensed DTV transmitter. With the knowledge of the detected coverage boundary, an opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm is developed for each D2D link to determine its MPEP. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can successfully enable D2D communications in TVWS while satisfying the interference constraint from the licensed DTV services. In addition, to our best knowledge, this is the first try to explore and exploit TVWS inside the DTV protection region resulted from the shadowing effect. Potential application scenarios include communications between internet of vehicles in the underground parking and D2D communications in hotspots such as subway, game stadiums, and airports.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07147778.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular-Base-Station-Assisted Device-to-Device Communications in TV White Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Cellular-Base-Station-Assisted Device-to-Device Communications in TV White Space","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15663085","htmlLink":"/document/7147778/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301160 and 61172062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular-Base-Station-Assisted Device-to-Device Communications in TV White Space","sourcePdf":"jsac-ding-2452532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139209S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7358196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"7358196","articleId":"7147778","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7147785,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqiang Ma","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7358196/7147785/ma-2452586-small.gif","p":["\n\nXiaoqiang Ma (S'11) received the B.Eng. degree from Huazhong University \nof Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010 and the M.Sc. degree from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, \nCanada, in 2012.

This ever-increasing data traffic puts significant pressure on the infrastructure of state-of-the-art cellular networks. Recently, device-to-device (D2D) communication that smartly explores local wireless resources has been suggested as a complement of great potential, particularly for the popular proximity-based applications with instant data exchange between nearby users. Significant studies have been conducted on coordinating the D2D and the cellular communication paradigms that share the same licensed spectrum, commonly with an objective of maximizing the aggregated data rate. The new generation of cellular networks, however, have long supported heterogeneous networked applications, which have highly diverse quality-of-service (QoS) specifications. In this paper, we jointly consider resource allocation and power control with heterogeneous QoS requirements from the applications. We closely analyze two representative classes of applications, namely streaming-like and file-sharing-like, and develop optimized solutions to coordinate the cellular and D2D communications with the best resource sharing mode. We further extend our solution to accommodate more general application scenarios and larger system scales. Extensive simulations under realistic configurations demonstrate that our solution enables better resource utilization for heterogeneous applications with less possibility of underprovisioning or overprovisioning.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452586","startPage":"15","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07147785.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Applications With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Applications With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147785/","accessionNumber":"15663084","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147785/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grant"},{"fundingName":"NSERC Strategic Project Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Applications With Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-ma-2452586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088458S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7358196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7358196","articleId":"7147785","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7147787,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjie Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7358196/7147787/jiang-2452493-small.gif","p":["\n\nJingjie Jiang (S'13) received the B.Engr. degree from the Department of \nAutomation, Tsinghua University, China, in 2012.

Conventionally, a device exclusively relies on cellular communication to retrieve the content it desires. With D2D communication, however, if the same piece of content is available in the vicinity of the device, the content can be directly retrieved from one of its neighbouring devices. Naturally, the key problem becomes how to maximize content sharing via D2D communication. Existing works on content sharing are mainly concerned with a multi-hop communication setting, while works on D2D communication have primarily focused on the communication aspects, including interference avoidance and energy efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing cellular traffic offloading with D2D communication, by selectively caching popular content locally, and by exploring maximal matching for sender-receiver pairs. Specifically, we consider an interference-aware communication model and formulate selective caching as a Knapsack problem, and sender-receiver matching as a maximum weighted matching problem in a bipartite graph. We propose decentralized algorithms to solve both problems, and our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms are effective in maximizing cellular traffic offloading.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07147787.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximized Cellular Traffic Offloading via Device-to-Device Content Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Maximized Cellular Traffic Offloading via Device-to-Device Content Sharing","volume":"34","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147787/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15663073","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council","grantNumber":"615613"},{"fundingName":"ChinaCache Int.

Since its conception, several researchers, academic institutions, industries, and regulatory and standardization bodies have put their significant efforts toward the realization of CR technology. However, as this technology adapts its transmission based on the surrounding radio environment, several practical issues may need to be considered. In practice, several imperfections, such as noise uncertainty, channel/interference uncertainty, transceiver hardware imperfections, signal uncertainty, and synchronization issues, may severely deteriorate the performance of a CR system. To this end, the investigation of realistic solutions toward combating various practical imperfections is very important for the successful implementation of cognitive technology. In this direction, first, this survey paper provides an overview of the enabling techniques for CR communications. Subsequently, it discusses the main imperfections that may occur in the most widely used CR paradigms and then reviews the existing approaches toward addressing these imperfections. Finally, it provides some interesting open research issues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","volume":"17","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15602554","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147789/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Techniques Under Practical Imperfections: A Survey","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Fund, Luxembourg"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"CRDPJ 461894-13"},{"fundingName":"Nutaq Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Techniques Under Practical Imperfections: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-sharma-2452414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270665S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7331734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"7331734","articleId":"7147789","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7147798,"authors":[{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7240139/7147798/swang-2452251_print-small.gif","p":["\nShaowei Wang (S'06\u2013M'07\u2013SM'13) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1997, 2003, and 2006, respectively.

We aim to maximize the energy efficiency of the CR network while considering practical restrictions, including the power budget of the system, the interference thresholds of the primary users (PUs), the rate requirements of the secondary users, and the fairness among them. Particularly, due to the lack of explicit support from the PU system, perfect channel state information may not be acquired. Thus, the interference constraint is posed as chance-constrained form and tackled by Bernstein approximation. Then, we convert the optimization task into a quasi-convex problem via relaxing the integer variables, followed by a simple rounding technique to yield feasible subchannels assignment. We derive a fast algorithm to distribute power among subchannels by exploiting the structure of the power-allocation problem. Moreover, we give an efficient heuristic algorithm for subchannels assignment, which reduces the computation load dramatically. Simulation results show that both our proposed resource allocation schemes perform well in practical scenarios. The energy efficiency obtained by the integer subchannels assignment and the fast power distribution achieves more than 98% of the upper bound. On the other hand, the proposed heuristic subchannels assignment with optimal power allocation achieves a good tradeoff between computation complexity and energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7240139/07147798.pdf","startPage":"3092","endPage":"3102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Interference","Approximation methods","Upper bound","Throughput","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel allocation","cognitive radio","communication complexity","convex programming","energy consumption","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network management","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computation complexity","upper bound","resource allocation scheme","computational load reduction","heuristic algorithm","optimal power allocation","power distribution","integer subchannel assignment","simple rounding technique","integer variable","quasi-convex problem","optimisation","Bernstein approximation","interference constraint","network fairness","PU system","secondary user","rate requirement","primary user","interference threshold","power budget","energy consumption","channel uncertainty","OFDM-based cognitive radio network","energy efficient resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy efficiency","proportional fairness","resource allocation"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy efficiency","proportional fairness","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7147798/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432818","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2452251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101012S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7240139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7240139","articleId":"7147798","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7147804,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["ETIS ENSEA/University of Cergy-Pontoise/CNRS UMR 8051, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7182396/7147804/dupra-2452259_print-small.gif","p":["\nElsa Dupraz was born in Paris, France.

We assume that the faulty hardware introduces errors during the message-passing updates, and we propose a general framework for the definition of the message update faulty functions. Within this framework, we define symmetry conditions for the faulty functions and derive two simple error models used in the analysis. With this analysis, we propose a new interpretation of the functional density evolution threshold introduced by Kameni et al. in the recent literature and show its limitations in the case of highly unreliable hardware. However, we show that under restricted decoder noise conditions, the functional threshold can be used to predict the convergence behavior of finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) under faulty hardware. In particular, we reveal the existence of robust and nonrobust FAIDs and propose a framework for the design of robust decoders. We finally illustrate robust- and nonrobust-decoder behaviors of finite-length codes using Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7182396/07147804.pdf","startPage":"2797","endPage":"2809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7182396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders Robust to Faulty Hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders Robust to Faulty Hardware","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147804/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15359431","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147804/","volume":"63","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union","grantNumber":"309129"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0963726 and CCF-1314147"},{"fundingName":"Fulbright Scholar Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders Robust to Faulty Hardware","sourcePdf":"tcomm-dupraz-2452259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142279S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7182396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7182396","articleId":"7147804","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7147809,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Salucci","affiliation":["ELEDIA Research Center, Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, UMR 8506 (CNRS-CentraleSup\u00e9lec-Universit\u00e9 de Paris Sud), Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7243393/7147809/saluc-2444391-small.gif","p":["\n\nMarco Salucci (S'13) received the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2011 and the Ph.D. degree in information and communications technology from ICT International Doctoral School, Trento, in 2014.","He is currently a permanent member of the ELEDIA Research Center, Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, and Since 2014, he has been the Technical Director of the ELEDIA Offshore-Lab @ Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

In the HSI, each superpixel can be regarded as a shape-adaptive region, which consists of a number of spatial neighboring pixels with very similar spectral characteristics. First, the proposed SC-MK method adopts an oversegmentation algorithm to cluster the HSI into many superpixels. Then, three kernels are separately employed for the utilization of the spectral information, as well as spatial information, within and among superpixels. Finally, the three kernels are combined together and incorporated into a support vector machine classifier. Experimental results on three widely used real HSIs indicate that the proposed SC-MK approach outperforms several well-known classification methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2445767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7243393/07147814.pdf","startPage":"6663","endPage":"6674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2445767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Hyperspectral Images by Exploiting Spectral\u2013Spatial Information of Superpixel via Multiple Kernels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147814/","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Hyperspectral Images by Exploiting Spectral\u2013Spatial Information of Superpixel via Multiple Kernels","volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432861","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147814/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172161"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325007"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Hunan University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Hyperspectral Images by Exploiting Spectral\u2013Spatial Information of Superpixel via Multiple Kernels","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2445767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109691S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7243393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"7243393","articleId":"7147814","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7147818,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7240139/7147818/ma-2452254_print-small.gif","p":["Hao Ma (S'11) was born in Shandong, China.

It has great potential to alleviate the strain on radio-frequency spectrum in indoor environments. VLC-enabled LED luminaries form VLC attocells that carry downlink data traffic to indoor mobile or stationary terminals. While one of the advantages of indoor VLC is low interference due to natural cell boundaries such as walls, multiple VLC attocells within a room would interfere. This is because illumination requirements often mandate a rich overlap of emissions of luminaries in a room. In this paper, we suggest the coordination of multiple VLC attocells (i.e., VLC-enabled LED luminaries) to turn the problem of overlap and thus interference into an advantage. We stipulate that this coordination can be accomplished through power line communication, which has been considered before as a means to transport data to VLC transmitters. Borrowing from concepts developed for radio-frequency wireless communications, we develop several precoding schemes for the new coordinated VLC broadcasting architecture. These include designs for the case of imperfect channel knowledge at the VLC transmitter, since channel information is usually provided through a low-rate feedback channel. The performance advantages for VLC transmission due to the proposed coordination and precoding designs are demonstrated based on a set of numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2452254","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7240139/07147818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7240139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Broadcasting for Multiuser Indoor Visible Light Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Broadcasting for Multiuser Indoor Visible Light Communication Systems","volume":"63","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15432799","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7147818/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Broadcasting for Multiuser Indoor Visible Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lampe-2452254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140732S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7240139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"7240139","articleId":"7147818","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7147821,"authors":[{"name":"Min Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7506358/7147821/yang-2395791-small.gif","p":["Min Yang received the B.S. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijjng, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, under the supervision of Prof. Y.

However, the examples collected directly by sampling are neither necessarily informative nor intended to be useful for classifier learning. Updating the classifier with these examples might introduce ambiguity to the tracker. In this paper, we present a novel online discriminative tracking framework that explicitly couples the objectives of example collection and classifier learning. Our method uses Laplacian regularized least squares (LapRLS) to learn a robust classifier that can sufficiently exploit unlabeled data and preserve the local geometrical structure of the feature space. To ensure the high classification confidence of the classifier, we propose an active example selection approach to automatically select the most informative examples for LapRLS. Part of the selected examples that satisfy strict constraints are labeled to enhance the adaptivity of our tracker, which actually provides robust supervisory information to guide semisupervised learning. With active example selection, we are able to avoid the ambiguity introduced by an independent example collection strategy and to alleviate the drift problem caused by misaligned examples. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on the comprehensive benchmark demonstrates that our tracking algorithm is more effective and accurate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Labeling","Robustness","Visualization","Prediction algorithms","Optimization","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","object tracking","optical tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laplacian regularized least square method","semisupervised learning","classifier learning","active example selection","on-line discriminative tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active example selection","active learning","discriminative tracking","semisupervised learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2395791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7506358/07147821.pdf","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7506358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2395791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Discriminative Tracking With Active Example Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Discriminative Tracking With Active Example Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147821/","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147821/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16139485","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB720000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203291 and 61375044"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Chinese Higher Education","grantNumber":"20121101110035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Discriminative Tracking With Active Example Selection","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wu-2395791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080885S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7506358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7506358","articleId":"7147821","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7147824,"authors":[{"name":"George Lentaris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7529101/7147824/lenta-2452781-small.gif","p":["George Lentaris received the B.Sc. degree in physics, the M.Sc. degree in logic, algorithms, and computation, and electronic automation, and the Ph.D. degree in computing from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.","He is a Research Associate with the National Technical University of Athens, Athens, where he is involved in hardware/software codesign with single-and multi-FPGA platforms and targeting space applications for ESA.

Increasing their navigation velocity and localization accuracy is essential for enabling these rovers to explore large areas on Mars. Contemporary Mars rovers move slowly, partially due to the long execution time of complex computer vision algorithms running on their slow space-grade CPUs. This paper exploits the advent of high-performance space-grade field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate the navigation of future rovers. Specifically, it focuses on visual odometry (VO) and performs HW/SW codesign to achieve one order of magnitude faster execution and improved accuracy. Conforming to the specifications of the European Space Agency, we build a proof-of-concept system on an HW/SW platform with processing power resembling that to be available onboard future rovers. We develop a codesign methodology adapted to the rover's specifications, design parallel architectures, and customize several feature extraction, matching, and motion estimation algorithms. We implement and evaluate five distinct HW/SW pipelines on a Virtex6 FPGA and a 150 MIPS CPU. We provide a detailed analysis of their cost-time-accuracy tradeoffs and quantify the benefits of employing FPGAs for implementing VO. Our solution achieves a speedup factor of 16\u00d7 over a CPU-only implementation, handling a stereo image pair in less than 1 s, with a 1.25% mean positional error after a 100 m traverse and an FPGA cost of 54 K LUTs and 1.46-MB RAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191256","htmlLink":"/document/7147824/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HW/SW Codesign and FPGA Acceleration of Visual Odometry Algorithms for Rover Navigation on Mars","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"European Space Agency through the SEXTANT Project within the ETP-MREP Research Programme","grantNumber":"ESTEC 4000103357/11/NL/EK"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HW/SW Codesign and FPGA Acceleration of Visual Odometry Algorithms for Rover Navigation on Mars","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lentaris-2452781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093198S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7529101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7529101","articleId":"7147824","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7147828,"authors":[{"name":"Qian-Fu Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qian-Fu","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0001-5080-5753","id":"37085338944"},{"name":"Shou-Kui Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shou-Kui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085337951"},{"name":"Hai-Peng Fu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Peng","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085337917"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"7147828","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Resonant frequency","Circuit synthesis","Time-domain analysis","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","power amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E-F lumped power amplifiers","transmission-line power amplifiers","voltage waveforms","current waveforms","load-network parameters","time-domain simulations","frequency-domain simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147828","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2447539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2447539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7177154/07147828.pdf","startPage":"2703","endPage":"2704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comments on \u201cHigh-Efficiency Class E/F Lumped and Transmission-Line Power Amplifiers\u201d","abstract":"In the above paper, the author presents the theoretical analysis of a single-ended Class E/Fn mode with explicit derivation of the idealized optimum voltage and current waveforms and load-network parameters with their verification by time- and frequency-domain simulations for a particular case of Class E/F3 mode with a 50% duty cycle.

High-performance codes usually arise from designing frames whose elements have mutually low coherence. Building off the original \u201cgroup frame\u201d design of Slepian which has since been elaborated in the works of Vale and Waldron, we present several new frame constructions based on cyclic and generalized dihedral groups. Slepian's original construction was based on the premise that group structure allows one to reduce the number of distinct inner pairwise inner products in a frame with n elements from [(n(n-1))/2] to n-1. All of our constructions further utilize the group structure to produce tight frames with even fewer distinct inner product values between the frame elements. When n is prime, for example, we use cyclic groups to construct m-dimensional frame vectors with at most [(n-1)/m] distinct inner products. We use this behavior to bound the coherence of our frames via arguments based on the frame potential, and derive even tighter bounds from combinatorial and algebraic arguments using the group structure alone. In certain cases, we recover well-known Welch bound achieving frames. In cases where the Welch bound has not been achieved, and is not known to be achievable, we obtain frames with close to Welch bound performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2450195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2450195","startPage":"5222","endPage":"5237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7217861/07147829.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Frames With Few Distinct Inner Products and Low Coherence","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7217861/7147829-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Group Frames With Few Distinct Inner Products and Low Coherence","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","volume":"63","issue":"19","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7147829/","accessionNumber":"15430447","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147829/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0932428, CCF-1018927, CCF-1423663 and CCF-1409204"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Group Frames With Few Distinct Inner Products and Low Coherence","sourcePdf":"tsp-thill-2450195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146577S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7217861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7217861","articleId":"7147829","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7147834,"authors":[{"name":"Geordie George","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7321101/7147834/georg-2452264-small.gif","p":["\n\nGeordie George (S'14) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Kannur University, Kerala, India, in 2004 and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering, with specialization in communication systems, from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2007.

The high path loss of mmWave and the physical obstructions make communication challenging. To compensate for the severe path loss, mmWave systems may employ a beam alignment algorithm that facilitates highly directional transmission by aligning the beam direction of multiple antenna arrays. This paper discusses a mmWave system employing dual-polarized antennas. First, we propose a practical soft-decision beam alignment (soft-alignment) algorithm that exploits orthogonal polarizations. By sounding the orthogonal polarizations in parallel, the equality criterion of the Welch bound for training sequences is relaxed. Second, the analog beamforming system is adapted to the directional characteristics of the mmWave link, assuming a high Ricean K-factor and poor scattering environment. A soft-alignment algorithm enables the mmWave system to align a large number of narrow beams to the channel subspace in an attempt to effectively scan the mmWave channel. Third, we propose a method to efficiently adapt the number of channel sounding observations to the specific channel environment based on an approximate probability of beam misalignment. Simulation results show that the proposed soft-alignment algorithm with adaptive sounding time effectively scans the channel subspace of a mobile user by exploiting polarization diversity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2452263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7321101/07147840.pdf","startPage":"6283","endPage":"6296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2452263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7147840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7147840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7147840/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583867","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nokia Networks"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program","grantNumber":"DGE-1333468"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-song-2452263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165701S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7321101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7321101","articleId":"7147840","onlineDate":"02 July 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7148143,"authors":[{"name":"Dragana Sandi\u0107-Stankovi\u0107","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunication and Electronics IRITEL, Beograd, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragana","lastName":"Sandi\u0107-Stankovi\u0107","id":"38275567900"},{"name":"Dragan Kukolj","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Kukolj","id":"37355406800"},{"name":"Patrick Le Callet","affiliation":["IRCCyN Lab, Ecole polytechnique de l'Universite de Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Le Callet","id":"37888345700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8958-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148143","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"abstract":"Most of the Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) techniques produce synthesized images which contain nonuniform geometric distortions affecting edges coherency.

It is shown that MW-PSNR achieves much higher correlation with human judgment compared to the state-of-the-art image quality measures in this context.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7128763/7148077/07148143.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 Seventh International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","doi":"10.1109/QoMEX.2015.7148143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QoMEX.2015.7148143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DIBR synthesized image quality assessment based on morphological wavelets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Measurement","Signal resolution","Distortion","Image quality","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image filtering","rendering (computer graphics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DIBR synthesized image quality assessment","morphological wavelets","depth image based rendering","nonuniform geometric distortions","edge coherency","image quality metrics","morphological filters","morphological wavelet peak signal-to-noise ratio measure","MW-PSNR","morphological wavelet decomposition","DIBR synthesized image evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-scale PSNR","morphological wavelets","nonseparable morphological wavelet decomposition","lifting scheme","quincunx sampling","DIBR synthesized image quality assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"DIBR synthesized image quality assessment based on morphological wavelets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15260785","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DIBR synthesized image quality assessment based on morphological wavelets","confLoc":"Pilos, Greece","sourcePdf":"74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06819S","chronDate":"26-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7128763","isNumber":"7148077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7128763","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7148077","articleId":"7148143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148383,"authors":[{"name":"Harvinder Jeet Kaur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Sharda University, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Harvinder Jeet","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37085536914"},{"name":"Rajiv Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Sharda University Greater, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37709982500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148383","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sentiment analysis","Feature extraction","Training","Twitter","Accuracy","Media","Floods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","information analysis","pattern classification","social networking (online)","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sentiment analysis","social media","Facebook","Twitter","polarity classification","textual data classification","public emotion","Naive Bayes","Kashmir floods dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social media","Crisis","Sentiment","Automatic","Classification","Polarity"]}],"abstract":"Advent of social media has created an unprecedented environment for people to share their thoughts with the world. These online platforms like facebook, Twitter are usually the first resort people turn to in times of crisis to voice their opinions and relay other crucial information. But when it comes to detecting sentiments out of this gigantic pool of opinions, it becomes an arduous task and doing it manually is practically impossible. Hence different methods have been devised to perform automatic polarity classification of textual data. This paper provides a brief overview of different techniques being developed for analyzing social media data, particularly Twitter data. We developed a workflow for applying sentiment analysis to a comparatively new domain of natural disasters to detect public emotions in crisis. A base line model is designed and trained on unigram features using Na\u00efve Bayes. The model is further tested on Kashmir floods dataset collected from Twitter and an overall accuracy of 67% is achieved. The result provides valuable information which will assist the authorities to strategize their actions with due consideration to public sentiments and hence ameliorate the process of managing such situations.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148383","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126877/7148334/07148383.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sentiment analysis from social media in crisis situations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148383/","displayDocTitle":"Sentiment analysis from social media in crisis situations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15260573","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148383/","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentiment analysis from social media in crisis situations","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"222594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109369S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148386,"authors":[{"name":"Deepjoy Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong, Meghalaya, India"],"firstName":"Deepjoy","lastName":"Das","id":"38187159000"},{"name":"Alok Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong, Meghalaya, India"],"firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37085345634"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148386","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Support vector machines","Knee","Kernel","Joints","Foot"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gait analysis","hidden Markov models","image classification","image segmentation","support vector machines","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human gait based gender identification system","hidden Markov model","support vector machines","human gender recognition system","silhouette segmentation","Center for Biometrics and Security Research","CASIA gait database","major body point identification","point-light display","feature extraction","two-dimensional coordinates","joint angles","feature classification","recognition rate","HMM","SVM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gender Recognition/Identification","Point-light (PL) display","Hidden Markov Model (HMM)","Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Human Gait"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents an approach towards human gender recognition system.

Hence, Feature selection is a critical step in the machine learning process. The role of feature selection is to select a subset of size `d' (d<;n) from the given set of `n' features that leads to the smallest classification error. Feature selection problem can be seen as the optimization problem where the goal is to pick the optimal or near optimal feature subset with respect to an objective function. Based on the literature, it is intuitively felt that the classifier will give its optimum performance if the high dimensional data is reduced to include only relevant attributes with low redundancy. Further, it is seen that the filter method is performance centric and the genetic algorithms are insensitive to noise data. This motivated us to combine the advantages of filter method with the genetic algorithm to make a hybrid system to select the optimal feature subset from the given original feature set. The contribution of this paper includes, simultaneous optimization of feature subset and classifier parameters, a multi-objective function that reduces the classification error with reduction in cardinality of feature subset and its cost. The vital aspect of this model is to generate an initial population through various filter approaches for the initialization stage. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of the model, experiments were conducted using KNN and decision tree (such as cart) on various UCI machine learning and generated datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively reduces the number of features without degrading the classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148389","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126877/7148334/07148389.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"289","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid feature subset selection by combining filters and genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid feature subset selection by combining filters and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15274881","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7148389/","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid feature subset selection by combining filters and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"228669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067638S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7148393,"authors":[{"name":"Jitendra Kumar","affiliation":["School of Computing Science & Engineering, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Jitendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37075450000"},{"name":"Rajesh Kumar","affiliation":["School of Computing Science & Engineering, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086066382"},{"name":"Mayank Dixit","affiliation":["School of Computing Science & Engineering, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Dixit","id":"37085337867"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148393","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148393","abstract":"In the recent years, the internet has become one of the most important resource of information.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for merging the results of retrieved documents from underlying search engines. The proposed algorithm makes use of genetic algorithm to find the single rank list of retrieved documents for the user query. The results show that the retrieved documents of rank list are more comprehensive and relevant.

The bugs are introduced in the software mainly because of the continuous changes that occur in the software code. These continuous changes tend to make the code complex. The complexity of code changes, quantified by Entropy is used to predict bugs. In previous research, Statistical Linear Regression is used to construct bug prediction model.

It manages the need of the consumer and faster provisioning of the best services in accordance with those objectives. For automation of cloud services an agent based framework has already been proposed by various researchers. In which there are set of agents that cooperate and collaborate by adapting certain behavior (i) to deal with consumer requirements, (ii) the discovery of services (iii) allocation of services, but doesn't ensure about the connection stability status of other agents (in on functioning or not) with any subset of agents. Due to lack of connection stability status there should be a chance that another random agent will not be available for the functionality of architecture but an intermediate agent tries to setup the communication bridge with that random agent. There might be a situation of halting condition. Hence, we propose a framework model, which provides a connection stability status detail with recent status and minimal amount of communication among agents. The proposed model makes use of multiprocessing environment with a shared memory, resulting in effective utilization of agents for the dealing with consumer requirements to the allocation of virtualized resources.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Automation","Computer architecture","Contracts","Protocols","Cloud computing","Software as a service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multi-agent systems","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","constraint based agent","cloud services","agent based framework","consumer requirements","services discovery","random agent","intermediate agent","communication bridge","random agent","halting condition","connection stability status detail","virtualized resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agents","multiprocessing","reliability","Service Provider","Consumer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148453","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148453","startPage":"649","endPage":"654","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126877/7148334/07148453.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148453/","displayDocTitle":"Automation in cloud computing using constraint based agent","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15260536","htmlLink":"/document/7148453/","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automation in cloud computing using constraint based agent","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"417466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071663S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148454,"authors":[{"name":"Deepesh Kumar","affiliation":["Galgotias University, India"],"firstName":"Deepesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085385458"},{"name":"Ajay Shanker Singh","affiliation":["Galgotias University, India"],"firstName":"Ajay Shanker","lastName":"Singh"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148454","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic scheduling","Computer architecture","Virtual machining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLA","service level agreement","resource access","dynamic computing infrastructure","on-demand service","cloud computing","resource allocation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Resource allocation","SLA"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing is an emerging technology which provides on-demand service, and it offers dynamic computing infrastructure and allocation of resources in an optimal way.

In this paper we propose a new approach which is based on EEMSR (Explicit Exact Minimal Storage Regenerating Code) with hash function which provides Reliability, Availability as well as Integrity. An EMSR code which is a Regenerating code, can exactly regenerate back a lost block with less repair traffic. An EMSR code is defined by the parameters (n, k, d) that permits data recovery from any k of n nodes, and also have the capability of repairing a failed node by connecting to any d nodes.

SI based algorithms are called intelligent because they are known to learn and improve their performance by observing the output on previous moves made by them. NIAs provide an efficient solution to many real-world optimization problems which are categorized to be NP-Hard Problems. NIAs have a huge list of applications and most of them prove to be more efficient than other algorithms and thus are many a time used in combination to other algorithms in order to improve performance and thus deliver a better QoS.

From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the parameters of the controller tuned in real time give better performance than those designed offline in speed regulation of the DC motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148527/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15260687","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148527/","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online tuning of fractional order PI controller using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online tuning of fractional order PI controller using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"620525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084439S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148528,"authors":[{"name":"Sragdhara Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT Patna, Patna, Bihar"],"firstName":"Sragdhara","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37085570920"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148528","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148528","abstract":"This paper intends to present an approach to classify different types of faults and to identify the location of the faults in a non-radial power system network using ElectroMagnetic Transients Program(ATP/EMTP)software and Artificial Neural Network(ANN). Firstly, a balanced three-phase system is designed with a RLC load and then different types of faults(single line to ground fault, line to line fault, double line to ground fault and three phase fault) are created at various points of the transmission line. The transmission line model is simulated using the EMTP software. The resulting current waveforms under different fault conditions are observed from the sending end. Fault occurs at the point where peaks appear in the current signal when viewed from the sending end. These current waveforms are analyzed using the wavelet toolbox in MATLAB and the entropy values of the current signals, so obtained, are given as input to the artificial neural network for automatic fault classification and identification of the faulty line. This scheme is also tested under different types of faults with different fault resistances and varying fault locations and the results show that it is able to discriminate the faults and identify the fault locations rapidly and correctly.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148528","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1037","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126877/7148334/07148528.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault detection on a ring-main type power system network using artificial neural network and wavelet entropy method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet packets","Fault diagnosis","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMTP","entropy","fault location","neural nets","power system faults","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","ring-main type power system network","artificial neural network","wavelet entropy method","ElectroMagnetic Transients Program","single line to ground fault","line to line fault","double line to ground fault","three phase fault","EMTP software","current waveforms","automatic fault classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ring main system","faults","Artificial neural network(ANN)","EMTP","wavelet entropy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fault detection on a ring-main type power system network using artificial neural network and wavelet entropy method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148528/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15260710","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault detection on a ring-main type power system network using artificial neural network and wavelet entropy method","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"621705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11086S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":7148552,"authors":[{"name":"Nagendra Pratap Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7126877/7148334/7148552/7148552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nagendra Pratap Singh received the B.

Another objective is to identify the thin blood vessels together with large blood vessel segments, which is not considering in some existing blood vessels segmentation methods in literature. The proposed method has been implemented on forty retinal images taken from DRIVE database and segmented results are compared with hand-labeled ground truth images also available in the DRIVE database.

One of the commonly used greedy approaches is Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), which can iteratively reconstruct the image.

The technology has various advantages such as large bandwidth (usually in THz), lower deployment cost, and interference immunity. However, the mobility of the receiving nodes is the main challenge in the deployment of IOW communication systems. The receiver mobility implies varying node location within the room. This severely affects the communication performance due to variation in the received power. In this paper, we analyze an IOW communication system which considers the possibility of the receiver mobility within the specified room dimensions. A detailed simulation based analysis is presented under spatially varying receiver locations while keeping the transmitter location and its power fixed. The effect of varying transmitter semi beam divergence angle on the impulse response, mean delay and root mean square (rms) delay have been investigated.

ALU's are at the core of a microprocessor where all mathematical and logical computations are being performed. ALU's are also one of the most power hungry sections in the processor's data path and are often the possible location of hot-spots. Efficient design of an ALU is therefore a critical issue in processor design environment. Conventional techniques of ALU design employ either tree or chain structure. The Tree structure is faster but requires larger area and hence suffers from more power dissipation. The Chain structure on the other hand requires lesser area, has comparatively lower power dissipation but is considerably slower. Therefore, their lies a huge scope for hybridizing both the ALU structures to obtain an intermediate hybrid ALU architecture which is efficient in Area, Speed and Power dissipation. In this paper, we have proposed a unique approach of hybrid customization based on Genetic Algorithm for the ALU design by mixing both the chain and tree structures to obtain a hybrid structure. A weighted cost function comprising of Delay, Area and Power dissipation parameters has been considered to find the best fit hybrid ALU architecture. Hybrid structure has shown an improvement of about 15.14% in terms of overall cost over the Tree structure and about 39.71% improvement over the chain structure when Delay, Power and Area were given a weightage of 25%, 25% and 50% respectively.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148576","pdfPath":"/iel7/7126877/7148334/07148576.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1303","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computing, Communication & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach for hybrid ALU design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach for hybrid ALU design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15260635","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7148576/","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm approach for hybrid ALU design","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"817442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057583S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7126877","isNumber":"7148334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7126877","xplore-issue":"7148334","articleId":"7148576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7148581,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Bhanwala","affiliation":["VLSI Division, Galgotias University, UP, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Bhanwala","id":"37085438212"},{"name":"Mayank Kumar","affiliation":["VLSI Division, Galgotias University, UP, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085442934"},{"name":"Yogendera Kumar","affiliation":["VLSI Division, Galgotias University, UP, India"],"firstName":"Yogendera","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085425110"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8890-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8889-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148581","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Multiplexing","Computer architecture","Hardware design languages","Ports (Computers)","Automation","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","low-power electronics","multiplexing equipment","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based design","reconfigurable router","NoC applications","Verilog hardware description language","Verilog HDL","crossbar switch","first in first out buffers","FIFO buffers","multiplexers","south channel","Modelsim","RTL view","Xilinx ISE 13.4","Xilinx SPARTAN-6 FPGA","power gating technique","XPower Analyzer tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network on Chip (NoC)","Reconfigurable Router","First in First out (FIFO) Buffer","Crossbar Switch","Multiplexer","Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design","Low Power","Power Gating"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148581","abstract":"FPGA based design of reconfigurable router for NoC applications is proposed in the present work.

FIFO buffers are used to store the data and the input and output of the data are controlled using multiplexers. Firstly, south channel is designed which includes the design of FIFO and multiplexers. After that, the crossbar switch and other three channels are designed. All these designed channels, FIFO buffers, multiplexers and crossbar switches are integrated to form the complete router architecture. The proposed design is simulated using Modelsim and the RTL view is obtained using Xilinx ISE 13.4. Xilinx SPARTAN-6 FPGAs are used for synthesis of proposed design. Power dissipation of the proposed reconfigurable router is reduced using Power gating technique. Total power is calculated by the use of XPower Analyzer tool.

But different types of multipath fading, multi-access and co-channel interferences put a limit on overall system performance. The mechanism of power control provides a best alternative to enhance the system performance. In this paper, the behavior of WCDMA system is analyzed by using Gaussian Approximation (GA) technique in which interference and channel noise in the system are generated by the approximations of mean and variance of interferer power. The various power control scenarios have been used to analyze the performance of Gaussian approximated WCDMA system. System performance with the severer effect of Rayleigh fading has also been analyzed for perfect power control based conventional and rake receivers. Simulation results are obtained for Signal to Interference Noise ratio (SIR) verses number of users and Bit Error Rate (BER) verses number of users at different power control scenarios with different system processing gain and different number of interfering cells.

Several transmit antennas send random pulses over some time-period and the echo is recorded by several receive antennas. The radar scene is resolved on an azimuth-range-Doppler grid. Sparsity is a natural assumption in this context and we study recovery of the radar scene via l\\-minimization. On the one hand we provide an estimate for the well-known restricted isometry property (RIP) ensuring stable and robust recovery. Compared to standard estimates available for Gaussian random measurements we require more measurements in order to resolve a scene of certain sparsity. Nevertheless, we show that our RIP estimate is optimal up to possibly logarithmic factors. By turning to a nonuniform analysis for a fixed radar scene, we reveal that the fine-structure of the support set (not only its size) influences the recovery performance. By introducing a parameter measuring the well-behavedness of the support we derive a bound for the number of measurements sufficient for recovery that resembles the minimal one for Gaussian random measurements if this parameter is close to optimal, i.e., if the support set is not pathological. Our analysis complements earlier work due to Friedlander and Strohmer where the support set was assumed to be random.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of sparse recovery in MIMO radar","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148844","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148844.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of sparse recovery in MIMO radar","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148844/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of sparse recovery in MIMO radar","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p30rauhut.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071574S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148847,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00f6tz E.

The nonlinear sampling methods, such as quadratic forms are also studied marginally to include undesired effects in data acquisition devices (e.g., Taylor series expansion up to two terms). In this paper, we introduce customized nonlinear sampling techniques that provide possibility of sparse signal recovery. The main advantage of the nonlinear method over the conventional linear schemes is the reduction in the number of required samples to 2k for recovery of k-sparse signals. We also introduce a low-complexity reconstruction method similar to the annihilating filter in the sampling of signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI). The disadvantage of this nonlinear sampler is its sensitivity to additive noise; thus, it is suitable in scenarios dealing with noiseless data such as network packets, where the data is either noiseless or it is erased.

One possible way of circumventing the divergence is to adapt the sampling series to the signals. In this paper we study adaptivity in the number of summands that are used in each approximation step, and whether this kind of adaptive signal processing can improve the convergence behavior of the sampling series. We approach the problem by considering approximation processes in general Banach spaces and show that adaptivity reduces the set of signals with divergence from a residual set to a meager or empty set. Due to the non-linearity of the adaptive approximation process, this study cannot be done by using the Banach-Steinhaus theory. We present examples from sampling based signal processing, where recently strong divergence, which is connected to the effectiveness of adaptive signal processing, has been observed.","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148882","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148882.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general approach for convergence analysis of adaptive sampling-based signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A general approach for convergence analysis of adaptive sampling-based signal processing","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148882/","accessionNumber":"15290531","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148882/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general approach for convergence analysis of adaptive sampling-based signal processing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p211boche.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051396S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7148884,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Unser","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group, Ecole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Unser","id":"37284958500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7353-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148884","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Splines (mathematics)","Stochastic processes","Technological innovation","Differential equations","Interpolation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian processes","interpolation","linear differential equations","mean square error methods","signal representation","signal sampling","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian stochastic process","sparse stochastic process","spline interpolation","minimum mean square error reconstruction","nonuniform sampling","uniform sampling","spline matching","compressed sensing sampling","nonGaussian process","linear differential equation","parsimonious representation","Besov regularity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148884","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148884.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and (sparse) stochastic processes: A tale of splines and innovation","abstract":"The commonality between splines and Gaussian or sparse stochastic processes is that they are ruled by the same type of differential equations. Our purpose here is to demonstrate that this has profound implications for the three primary forms of sampling: uniform, nonuniform, and compressed sensing. The connection with classical sampling is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between spline interpolation and the minimum-mean-square-error reconstruction of a Gaussian process from its uniform or nonuniform samples. The caveat, of course, is that the spline type has to be matched to the operator that whitens the process. The connection with compressed sensing is that the non-Gaussian processes that are ruled by linear differential equations generally admit a parsimonious representation in a wavelet-like basis. There is also a construction based on splines that yields a wavelet-like basis that is matched to the underlying differential operator. It has been observed that expansions in such bases provide excellent M-term approximations of sparse processes. This property is backed by recent estimates of the local Besov regularity of sparse processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7148884/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290427","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and (sparse) stochastic processes: A tale of splines and innovation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and (sparse) stochastic processes: A tale of splines and innovation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p221unser.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067049S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148888,"authors":[{"name":"Sinuk Kang","affiliation":["Division of Mathematics and Informational Statistics, Wonkwang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sinuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085499013"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7353-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148888","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"Several sampling theorems for deterministic signals are known to have their counterparts for stochastic signals.

The goal is to take narrow-band filtered samples so as to estimate process parameters as accurately as possible.

The first is a standard sample variance estimator. The second, a generalization, is a maximum-likelihood estimator, useful when samples are correlated.

In particular, with the recent rise of Compressive Sensing (CS), multiple sensing schemes have been developed. However, for the moment, CS reconstruction techniques take a relatively long time to properly converge. Therefore, it limits the sensor resolution and potential applications. On the other hand, it generally involves complex structures and circuitries at the sensor side. This work proposes an acquisition chain performing an adaptive sensing of pseudo-randomly selected samples. This specific nonuniform sampling scheme allows to parallelize and simplify the acquisition thanks to a compact design based on sigma delta converters and cellular automata.

The main idea is to use a combination of full and compressed sensing. Full sensing is conducted for every several slices (F-slice) while compressed sensing with high compression rate is applied to the rest of slices (C-slice). We can perfectly reconstruct F-slice images, which are used to roughly estimate the C-slices. Since the estimate is already of good quality, its difference from the original image is small and sparse. Therefore, the difference can be reconstructed precisely using the standard compressed sensing technique even with high compression rate. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods with 3.16dB for arm images, 0.26dB for brain images in average for the C-slices with perfect reconstruction for the F-slices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148898.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI using sparsity induced from adjacent slice similarity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Image coding","Sensors","Discrete Fourier transforms","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing MRI","sparsity","adjacent slice similarity","magnetic resonance imaging technique","full sensing","compression rate","C-slice","F-slice image reconstruction","original image","standard compressed sensing technique","arm images","brain images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI using sparsity induced from adjacent slice similarity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290489","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing MRI using sparsity induced from adjacent slice similarity","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p287hirabayashi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07603S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148900,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bastounis","affiliation":["DAMTP, University of Cambridge, Cambridge"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bastounis","id":"37085592375"},{"name":"Anders C.

There are a collection of tools which aim to mathematically describe compressed sensing when the sampling pattern is taken in a random or deterministic way. Unfortunately, there are many practical applications where the well studied concepts of uniform recovery and the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) can be shown to be insufficient explanations for the success of compressed sensing. This occurs both when the sampling pattern is taken using a deterministic or a non-deterministic method. We shall study this phenomenon and explain why the RIP is absent, and then propose an adaptation which we term `the RIP in levels' which aims to solve the issues surrounding the RIP. The paper ends by conjecturing that the RIP in levels could provide a collection of results for deterministic sampling patterns.","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148900","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148900.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On random and deterministic compressed sensing and the Restricted Isometry Property in levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148900/","displayDocTitle":"On random and deterministic compressed sensing and the Restricted Isometry Property in levels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290412","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148900/","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On random and deterministic compressed sensing and the Restricted Isometry Property in levels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p297bastounis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080866S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148906,"authors":[{"name":"Takanobu Ishikawa","affiliation":["Tokyo City University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takanobu","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37085472121"},{"name":"Ryosuke Takayama","affiliation":["Tokyo City University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Takayama","id":"37085452057"},{"name":"Shuichi Arai","affiliation":["Tokyo City University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Arai","id":"37085471030"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7353-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148906","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Continuous wavelet transforms","Accuracy","Discrete wavelet transforms","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","discrete wavelet transforms","fast Fourier transforms","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor spectrum synthesis","Gaussian convolution","time-frequency analysis","nonstationary signal","continuous wavelet transform","fast Gabor wavelet transform","Mallat algorithm","discrete wavelet transform","speeding-up method","nonorthogonal wavelet","orthonormal function","FFT","FFT","CWT","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gabor Transform","Gabor Wavelet Transform","complexity reduction","spectrum synthesis"]}],"abstract":"Gabor wavelet transform is often used in time-frequency analysis for non-stationary signals. However, the calculation of continuous wavelet transform including Gabor wavelet transform is very complex. Mallat algorithm in discrete wavelet transform is representative of a speeding-up method of wavelet transform, but we can't use this algorithm for the Gabor wavelet since the Gabor wavelet is a non-orthogonal wavelet. Some methods, which approximate the basis function to orthonormal function, have been proposed to solve this issue. However, approximate accuracy of each algorithm is low. In this paper, we focus on mathematical characteristics of a Gaussian which is used as a basis function, and propose a synthetic method of wavelet coefficients using Gabor spectra which are calculated using FFT. In addition, we discussed the synthetic accuracy and calculation complexity, then made it clear that we can reduce the calculation complexity to about 1/20 in regard to general CWT maintaining the desired accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148906","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","startPage":"327","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Gabor wavelet transform based on synthesis of Gabor spectrum using convolution of Gaussian","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Gabor wavelet transform based on synthesis of Gabor spectrum using convolution of Gaussian","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148906/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290503","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7148906/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Gabor wavelet transform based on synthesis of Gabor spectrum using convolution of Gaussian","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p327ishikawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066617S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148908,"authors":[{"name":"Siheng Chen","affiliation":["ECE, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Siheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085436580"},{"name":"Rohan Varma","affiliation":["ECE, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Varma","id":"37085448173"},{"name":"Aarti Singh","affiliation":["Machine learning Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Aarti","lastName":"Singh","id":"38244010600"},{"name":"Jelena Kovacevi\u0107","affiliation":["ECE & BME, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Kovacevi\u0107","id":"38241605100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7353-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148908","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Bandwidth","Signal processing algorithms","Approximation methods","Frequency estimation","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","convergence of numerical methods","graph theory","matrix algebra","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal recovery","smooth graph signals","random designed sampling","experimentally designed sampling","approximately bandlimited","sampling scores","matrix approximation","leverage scores","low-frequency components","unbiased estimators","convergence rate","ring graph","Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graph","star graph"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148908","abstract":"We study signal recovery on graphs based on two sampling strategies: random sampling and experimentally designed sampling.

Nevertheless increasing the sampling frequency involves an increasing sensibility of the system to desynchronization between the different ADCs that leads to time-skew errors, impacting the system with non linear distortions. The estimation and compensation of these errors are considered as one of the main challenge to deal with in TI-ADCs. Some methods have been previously proposed, mainly in the field of circuits and systems, to estimate the time-skew error but they mainly involve hardware correction and they lack of flexibility, using an inflexible uniform sampling reference. In this paper, we propose to model the output of L interleaved and desynchronized ADCs with a sampling scheme called Periodic Non-uniform Sampling of order L (PNSL). This scheme has been initially proposed as an alternative to uniform sampling for aliasing cancellation, particularly in the case of bandpass signals. We use its properties here to develop a flexible on-line digital estimation and compensation method of the time delays between the desynchronized channels. The estimated delay is exploited in the PNSL reconstruction formula leading to an accurate reconstruction without hardware correction and without any need to adapt the sampling operation. Our method can be used in a simple Built-In Self-Test (BIST) strategy with the use of learning sequences and our model appears more flexible and less electronically expensive, following the principles of \u201cDirty Radio Frequency\u201d paradigm: designing imperfect analog circuits with subsequently digital corrections of these imperfections.","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148936","startPage":"473","endPage":"477","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148936.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive estimation and compensation of the time delay in a periodic non-uniform sampling scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive estimation and compensation of the time delay in a periodic non-uniform sampling scheme","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148936/","accessionNumber":"15290527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148936/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive estimation and compensation of the time delay in a periodic non-uniform sampling scheme","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p473vernhes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059383S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7148943,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher A.

The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithm involves efficient updates. Importantly, we prove that although the proposed formulation is highly nonconvex, our algorithm converges to the set of critical points of the objective defining the formulation. We illustrate the promise of the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space measurements.

The final result of this paper shows that in the one dimensional case where the underlying signal is gradient sparse and its sparsity pattern satisfies a minimum separation condition, then to guarantee exact recovery with high probability, for some M <; N, it suffices to draw O(s log M logs) samples uniformly at random from the Fourier coefficients whose frequencies are no greater than M.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery guarantees for TV regularized compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148945","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148945.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Recovery guarantees for TV regularized compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148945/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290495","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery guarantees for TV regularized compressed sensing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p518poon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090578S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7148946,"authors":[{"name":"Azra Abtahi","affiliation":["ACRI and EE Dept, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","ECE Dept, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Azra","lastName":"Abtahi","id":"37085570809"},{"name":"M.

In this paper a new method of energy allocation to the transmitters is proposed to improve the performance of the block CS-based distributed MIMO radars. This method is based on the minimization of an upper bound of the sensing matrix block-coherence.

Our algorithm termed generalized sparse uniform resampling (GSURS) uses methods from modern sampling theory. Selection of an intermediate subspace generated by integer translations of a compactly supported generating kernel produces a sparse system of equations representing the relation between the nonuniformly spaced samples and a series of generalized samples. This sparse system of equations can be solved efficiently using a sparse equation solver. A correction filter is subsequently applied to the result in order to attain the uniformly spaced samples of the signal. We demonstrate the application of the new method for reconstructing MRI data from nonuniformly spaced k-space samples. In this scenario, the algorithm is first used to calculate uniformly spaced k-space samples, and subsequently an inverse FFT is applied to these samples in order to obtain the reconstructed image. Simulations using a numerical phantom are used to compare the performance of GSURS with other reconstruction methods, in particular convolutional gridding and the nonuniform FFT.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Sparse matrices","Magnetic resonance imaging","Mathematical model","Phantoms","Trajectory","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","convolution","fast Fourier transforms","image filtering","image reconstruction","image sampling","inverse transforms","phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized sparse uniform resampling","GSURS","resampling data","nonuniform grid","sampling theory","sparse system","sparse equation solver","correction filter","MRI data","k-space samples","fast Fourier transforms","inverse FFT","reconstructed image","numerical phantom","reconstruction methods","convolutional gridding","nonuniform FFT"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148949","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148949.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GSURS: Generalized sparse uniform resampling with application to MRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GSURS: Generalized sparse uniform resampling with application to MRI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148949/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7148949/","accessionNumber":"15290445","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GSURS: Generalized sparse uniform resampling with application to MRI","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p538kiperwas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053291S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7148950,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Ongie","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Ongie","id":"37085390469"},{"name":"Mathews Jacob","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa"],"firstName":"Mathews","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37266834000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7353-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7148950","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7148950","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Image edge detection","Fourier transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image resolution","Phantoms","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image filtering","image restoration","image sampling","magnetic resonance imaging","matrix algebra","phantoms","piecewise constant techniques","polynomials","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piecewise smooth image recovery","Fourier sample","Prony-like method","discontinuity set","zero level-set","trigonometric polynomial","Fourier transform coefficient","partial derivative","annihilation relation","piecewise constant image","convex matrix completion algorithm","low-rank matrix","annihilating filter","signal estimation","MRI phantom"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a Prony-like method to recover a continuous domain 2-D piecewise smooth image from few of its Fourier samples.

We consider the mean squared error performance metric where the input signal statistics are known. Fixing the output bitrate introduces a trade-off between the sampling rate and the number of bits used to quantize each sample. That is, while increasing the sampling rate reduces the in-band quantization noise, it also reduces the number of bits available to quantize each sample and therefore increases the magnitude of the quantization noise. The optimal sampling rate is the result of the interplay between these two phenomena. In this work we analyze the sampling rate of a Sigma-Delta modulator of arbitrary order under the approximation that the quantization error behaves like additive white noise that is uncorrelated with the signal. We show that for a signal with a spectrum that is constant over its bandwidth, the optimal sampling rate is either the Nyquist rate or the maximal sampling rate corresponding to the output bitrate. The choice between the two is approximately a function of the Sigma-Delta system order and the bitrate per unit bandwidth.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148833","startPage":"627","endPage":"631","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Sampling Theory and Applications (SampTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7131338/7148833/07148967.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal trade-off between sampling rate and quantization precision in Sigma-Delta A/D conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7148967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7148967/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal trade-off between sampling rate and quantization precision in Sigma-Delta A/D conversion","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15290517","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal trade-off between sampling rate and quantization precision in Sigma-Delta A/D conversion","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"p627kipnis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046264S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7131338","isNumber":"7148833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7131338","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7148833","articleId":"7148967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149006,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanxun Zhang","affiliation":["University of Missouri-Columbia"],"firstName":"Yuanxun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085528042"},{"name":"Prasad Calyam","affiliation":["University of Missouri-Columbia"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Calyam","id":"37393638800"},{"name":"Saptarshi Debroy","affiliation":["University of Missouri-Columbia"],"firstName":"Saptarshi","lastName":"Debroy","id":"37394935900"},{"name":"Mukundan Sridharan","affiliation":["The Samraksh Company"],"firstName":"Mukundan","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37414898000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7795-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7149006","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Network topology","Topology","Event detection","Delays","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network theory (graphs)","parallel processing","principal component analysis","sensor fusion","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCA-based network-wide correlated anomaly event detection","distributed computing application","multidomain network","open framework","multiple time series","principal component analysis","perfSONAR","one-way delay measurement dataset","black-box correlation analysis tool","high performance computing"]}],"abstract":"High-performance computing environments supporting large-scale distributed computing applications need multi-domain network performance measurements from open frameworks such as perfSONAR.

A special case of cell outage, referred to as Sleeping Cell (SC) remains particularly challenging to detect in state-of-the-art SON, since it triggers no alarms for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) entity. Consequently, no SON compensation function can be launched unless site visits or drive tests are performed, or complaints are received by affected customers. To address this issue, we present and evaluates a COD framework, which is based on minimization of drive test (MDT) reports, a functionality recently specified in third generation partnership project (3GPP) Release 10, for LTE Networks. Our proposed framework aims to detect cell outages in an autonomous fashion by first pre-processing the MDT measurements using multidimensional scaling method and further employing it together with machine learning algorithms to detect and localize anomalous network behaviour. We validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution using the data obtained from simulating the network under various operational settings.","doi":"10.1109/DRCN.2015.7149014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRCN.2015.7149014","startPage":"203","endPage":"210","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 11th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7132053/7148972/07149014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 11th International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7148972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven analytics for automated cell outage detection in Self-Organizing Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven analytics for automated cell outage detection in Self-Organizing Networks","conferenceDate":"24-27 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7149014/","accessionNumber":"15290725","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149014/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven analytics for automated cell outage detection in Self-Organizing Networks","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p203zoha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070644S","chronDate":"24-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7132053","isNumber":"7148972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7132053","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7148972","articleId":"7149014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7149025,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Zhao","affiliation":["Computer Science & Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085433922"},{"name":"Mayanka Chandrashekar","affiliation":["Computer Science & Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Mayanka","lastName":"Chandrashekar","id":"37085441851"},{"name":"Yugyung Lee","affiliation":["Computer Science & Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Yugyung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085433339"},{"name":"Deep Medhi","affiliation":["Computer Science & Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA"],"firstName":"Deep","lastName":"Medhi","id":"37085407464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7795-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7149025","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1886},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","IP networks","Storms","Fasteners","Support vector machines","Ports (Computers)","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","fault tolerant computing","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time network anomaly detection system","scalable fault-tolerant resilient monitoring system","machine learning algorithms","Big data processing frameworks","University of Missouri-Kansas City","campus network data"]}],"abstract":"The ability to process, analyze, and evaluate realtime data and to identify their anomaly patterns is in response to realized increasing demands in various networking domains, such as corporations or academic networks.

Multichannel modifications of greedy algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), as well as convex mixed-norm extensions of the Lasso, have typically been deployed for efficient signal estimation. While accurate recovery is possible under certain circumstances, it has been established that these methods may all fail in regimes where traditional subspace techniques from array processing, notably the MUSIC algorithm, can provably succeed. Against this backdrop several recent hybrid algorithms have been developed that merge a subspace estimation step with OMP-like procedures to obtain superior results, sometimes with theoretical guarantees. In contrast, this paper considers a completely different approach built upon Bayesian compressive sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that minor modifications of standard Bayesian algorithms can naturally obtain the best of both worlds backed with theoretical and empirical support, surpassing the performance of existing hybrid MUSIC and convex simultaneous sparse approximation algorithms, especially when poor RIP conditions render alternative approaches ineffectual.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7147631/7149089/07149269.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"2015 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2015.68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2015.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7149269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented Bayesian Compressive Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Multiple signal classification","Compressed sensing","Estimation","Sparks","Matching pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented Bayesian compressive sensing","simultaneous sparse approximation problem","support pattern","array processing","standard Bayesian algorithm modifications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["simultaneous sparse approximation","Bayesian compressive sensing","compressive MUSIC","multiple response models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Bayesian Compressive Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7149269/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15261103","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Bayesian Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"8430a123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096864S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7147631","isNumber":"7149089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7147631","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7149089","articleId":"7149269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149270,"authors":[{"name":"Xinwei Gao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xinwei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37065165200"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085547796"},{"name":"Wenbin Che","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Che","id":"37085553273"},{"name":"Xiaopeng Fan","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401467700"},{"name":"Debin Zhao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277017000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8430-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0359"}],"articleNumber":"7149270","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"abstract":"Gaussian random matrix (GRM) has been widely used to generate linear measurements in compressive sensing (CS) of natural images. However, in practice, there actually exist two problems with GRM. One is that GRM is non-sparse and complicated, leading to high computational complexity and high difficulty in hardware implementation. The other is that regardless of the characteristics of signal the measurements generated by GRM are also random, which results in low efficiency of compression coding. In this paper, we design a novel local structural measurement matrix (LSMM) for block-based CS coding of natural images by utilizing the local smooth property of images. The proposed LSMM has two main advantages. First, LSMM is a highly sparse matrix, which can be easily implemented in hardware, and its reconstruction performance is even superior to GRM at low CS sampling sub rate. Second, the adjacent measurement elements generated by LSMM have high correlation, which can be exploited to greatly improve the coding efficiency. Furthermore, this paper presents a new framework with LSMM for block-based CS coding of natural images, including measurement generating, measurement coding and CS reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed framework with LSMM for block-based CS coding of natural images greatly enhances the existing CS coding performance when compared with other state-of-the-art image CS coding schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7147631/7149089/07149270.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"142","publicationTitle":"2015 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2015.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2015.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7149270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Based Compressive Sensing Coding of Natural Images by Local Structural Measurement Matrix","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Correlation","Encoding","Current measurement","Sparse matrices","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian processes","image coding","image reconstruction","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian random matrix","GRM","linear measurements","compressive sensing","natural images","compression coding","local structural measurement matrix","LSMM","block-based CS coding","local smooth property","adjacent measurement elements","CS reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing Coding","Local Structural Measurement Matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Block-Based Compressive Sensing Coding of Natural Images by Local Structural Measurement Matrix","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7149270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15261104","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2015","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Based Compressive Sensing Coding of Natural Images by Local Structural Measurement Matrix","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"8430a133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103247S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7147631","isNumber":"7149089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7147631","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7149089","articleId":"7149270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149316,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam Mohamed Kasem","affiliation":["Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hossam Mohamed","lastName":"Kasem","id":"37085388390"},{"name":"Osumu Muta","affiliation":["Center for Japan-Egypt Cooperation in Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Osumu","lastName":"Muta","id":"37085392352"},{"name":"Maha Elsabrouty","affiliation":["Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Elsabrouty","id":"37297463000"},{"name":"Hiroshi Frukawa","affiliation":["Center for Japan-Egypt Cooperation in Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Frukawa","id":"37085390508"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8430-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0359"}],"articleNumber":"7149316","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Compressed sensing","Sensors","Psychoacoustic models","Reconstruction algorithms","Data compression","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","compressed sensing","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of audio signal","perceptual audio signal compression system","quantized perceptual compressed sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","audio compression","1-bit compressed sensing","perceptual compressed sensing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose using different quantization values, including 1-bit compressed sensing for perceptual audio signal compression in perceptual systems[1], in order to clarify the effect of the quantization process on the achievable quality of audio signal.

Energy consumption and carbon imprints of Cloud infrastructures have thus become a key environmental concern, and several approaches have been proposed with the aim of increasing their energy-efficiency, both within individual data centers and at the level of the infrastructure as a whole. Among these approaches, low-carbon routing algorithms offer operational solutions, which consist in dynamically routing connection requests in order to maximize the use of renewable energy or, equivalently, minimize the use of non- renewable energy. The main claim of this paper is that the existing body of methods suffers from some practical limitations due to the fact that they consider a single objective, at the possible expense of other important aspects such as Quality of Service and cost. Therefore, we propose a bi-criteria routing model, in which both carbon reduction and quality of service, in the form of data transmission delay, are considered as objectives to optimize. Under this model, which to the the best of our knowledge is the fist bi-criteria formulation of the dynamic routing problem in Cloud computing environments, We describe an algorithm to compute efficient supported and non-supported solutions in order to dynamically route connection requests. The application of our algorithm is illustrated through a case study simulated under the same conditions as a previously published work considering a single criterion approach and comparison results are drawn.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bi-Criteria Algorithm for Low-Carbon and QoS-Aware Routing in Cloud Computing Infrastructures","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","doi":"10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149620","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145509/7149613/07149620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7149620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Bi-Criteria Algorithm for Low-Carbon and QoS-Aware Routing in Cloud Computing Infrastructures","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7149620/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15291748","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bi-Criteria Algorithm for Low-Carbon and QoS-Aware Routing in Cloud Computing Infrastructures","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"pid1161176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046723S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145509","isNumber":"7149613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145509","xplore-issue":"7149613","articleId":"7149620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149634,"authors":[{"name":"AlAlaa Tashkandi","affiliation":["College of Industrial Management, KFUPM, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"AlAlaa","lastName":"Tashkandi","id":"37085413169"},{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Jabri","affiliation":["College of Industrial Management, KFUPM, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Al-Jabri","id":"37085406777"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6618-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6617-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7149634","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":721},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Education","Computational modeling","Organizations","Technological innovation","Context","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer aided instruction","data privacy","educational institutions","further education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","higher education institutions","Saudi Arabia","TOE model","technology, organization and environment model","Arabian Gulf region","partial least square","data privacy","universities","Internet infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"(1) Background, Motivation and Objective: Academic study of Cloud Computing within Saudi Arabia is an emerging research field. Saudi Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arabian Gulf region. This positions it as a potential market of cloud computing technologies. Adoption of new innovations should be preceded by analysis of the added value, challenges and adequacy from technological, organizational and environmental perspectives. (2) Statement of Contribution/Method: This cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on Technology, Organization and Environment model targeting higher education institutions. In this study, the factors that influence the adoption by higher education institutions were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Square. (3) Results, Discussion and Conclusions: Three factors were found significant in this context. Relative Advantage, Data Privacy and Complexity are the most significant factors. The model explained 43% of the total adoption measure variation. Significant differences in the areas of cloud computing compatibility, complexity, vendor lock-in and peer pressure between large and small institutions were revealed. Items for future cloud computing research were explored through open-ended questions. Adoption of cloud services by higher education institutions has been started. It was found that the adoption rate among large universities is higher than small higher education institutions. Improving the network and Internet Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia at an affordable cost is a pre-requisite for cloud computing adoption. Cloud service provider should address the privacy and complexity concerns raised by non-adopters. Future information systems that are potential for hosting in cloud were prioritized.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149634","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145509/7149613/07149634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149613","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Adoption by Higher Education Institutions in Saudi Arabia: Analysis Based on TOE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7149634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Adoption by Higher Education Institutions in Saudi Arabia: Analysis Based on TOE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149634/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15291770","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7149634/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Adoption by Higher Education Institutions in Saudi Arabia: Analysis Based on TOE","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"pid1161166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073476S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145509","isNumber":"7149613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145509","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7149613","articleId":"7149634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149649,"authors":[{"name":"Gamal Sallam","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Gamal","lastName":"Sallam","id":"37085582409"},{"name":"Ashraf Mahmoud","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ashraf","lastName":"Mahmoud","id":"37302353600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6618-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6617-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7149649","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":832},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of OLSR and AODV in VANET Cloud Computing Using Fading Model with SUMO and NS3","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7149649","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Vehicles","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Throughput","Fading","Propagation losses","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","fading","performance evaluation","routing protocols","statistical analysis","telecommunication network topology","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","OLSR","AODV","VANET cloud computing","fading model","SUMO","NS3","vehicular ad-hoc network","mobile ad-hoc network","high speed topology","extreme topology change","VANET configuration","ad-hoc on-demand distance vector","optimized link-state routing protocol","network simulator 3","signal fading","worst-case scenario","network-as-a-service","packet delivery ratio","transmission rate","statistical analysis"]}],"abstract":"Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a new emerging type of mobile ad-hoc network that is characterized by high speed and extreme topology changes over short time. These two characteristics dramatically affect the performance of the routing protocols employed in these networks. The evaluation of different routing protocols for general VANET configuration provides great insight into the performance of the entire network. In this work, we evaluate, analyze, and compare the performances of two prevalent routing protocols: ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and optimized link-state routing protocol (OLSR). The evaluation is performed using Network Simulator 3 (NS3) and assumes high mobility and account for signal fading to present worst-case scenarios for the two protocols. We consider the architecture Network-as-a-service of VANET cloud computing. Simulation results indicate that while AODV outperforms OLSR in terms of packet delivery ratio for low transmission rates, statistical analysis shows that there is no significant difference between the performances of the two protocols.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149649","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cloud Computing (ICCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7145509/7149613/07149649.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7149613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7149649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of OLSR and AODV in VANET Cloud Computing Using Fading Model with SUMO and NS3","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15291730","htmlLink":"/document/7149649/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of OLSR and AODV in VANET Cloud Computing Using Fading Model with SUMO and NS3","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"pid1161130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045997S","chronDate":"26-29 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7145509","isNumber":"7149613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7145509","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7149613","articleId":"7149649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7149654,"authors":[{"name":"Omer K.
