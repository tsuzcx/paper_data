In addition, through the social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm, the capability of humans and devices to discover and exploit objects with their services is augmented. Thus, SIoT has become a promising network for service discovery and composition. By introducing SIoT, we can expand the traditional mobile crowdsourcing network and achieve broader crowdsourcing application. However, some threats are also raised in SIoT environments. In order to handle these challenges, we first present a trustworthy crowdsourcing model in SIoT. In this model, social cloud provides compute and storage functions, and works as a service provider to bridge end users and sensing entities; sensing entities receive tasks and rewards from a service provider and feed back data. Then the concept of social awareness is introduced to message forwarding among objects in SIoT, providing social data links. Furthermore, a reputation-based auction mechanism is incorporated into crowdsourcing to perform winner selection and payment determination by evaluating the reliability of crowdsourcing participants. Finally, some challenges in trustworthy crowdsourcing are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2016.7721739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7721728/07721739.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2016.7721739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7721728","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward trustworthy crowdsourcing in the social internet of things","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7721739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward trustworthy crowdsourcing in the social internet of things","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7721739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2016","accessionNumber":"16448424","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7721739/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward trustworthy crowdsourcing in the social internet of things","sourcePdf":"011SHU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051476S","chronDate":"October  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7721728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7721728","articleId":"7721739","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7721743,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Centenaro","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova"],"bio":{"p":["Marco Centenaro [S] (marco.centenaro@dei.unipd.it) received his Bachelor's degree in information engineering in 2012 and his Master's degree in telecommunication engineering in 2014, both from the University of Padova, Italy.

In particular, we focus on the messaging protocol of a universal IoT home gateway, where our cloud enabled system consists of a back-end server, a unified home gateway (UHG) at the end users, and a user interface for mobile devices. We discuss the features of such an IoT system to support a large-scale deployment with a UHG and real-time residential smart grid applications. Based on the requirements, we design an IoT system using XMPP and implemented in a testbed for energy management applications.

Today, various flavors have evolved of IoT, cloud computing, and so-called fog computing, a concept referring to capabilities of edge devices and users' clients to compute, store, and exchange data among each other and with the cloud. Although the rapid pace of this evolution was not easily foreseeable, today each piece of it facilitates and enables the deployment of what we commonly refer to as a smart scenario, including smart cities, smart transportation, and smart homes. As most current cloud, fog, and network services run simultaneously in each scenario, we observe that we are at the dawn of what may be the next big step in the cloud computing and networking evolution, whereby services might be executed at the network edge, both in parallel and in a coordinated fashion, as well as supported by the unstoppable technology evolution. As edge devices become richer in functionality and smarter, embedding capacities such as storage or processing, as well as new functionalities, such as decision making, data collection, forwarding, and sharing, a real need is emerging for coordinated management of fog-to-cloud (F2C) computing systems. This article introduces a layered F2C architecture, its benefits and strengths, as well as the arising open and research challenges, making the case for the real need for their coordinated management. Our architecture, the illustrative use case presented, and a comparative performance analysis, albeit conceptual, all clearly show the way forward toward a new IoT scenario with a set of existing and unforeseen services provided on highly distributed and dynamic compute, storage, and networking resources, bringing together heterogeneous and commodity edge devices, emerging fogs, as well as conventional clouds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foggy clouds and cloudy fogs: a real need for coordinated management of fog-to-cloud computing systems","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2016.7721750","startPage":"120","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2016.7721750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7721728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7721728/07721750.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7721750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7721750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2016","displayDocTitle":"Foggy clouds and cloudy fogs: a real need for coordinated management of fog-to-cloud computing systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7721750/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2016","accessionNumber":"16448430","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foggy clouds and cloudy fogs: a real need for coordinated management of fog-to-cloud computing systems","sourcePdf":"022MASIP-BRUIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033957S","chronDate":"October  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7721728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"7721728","articleId":"7721750","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7723474,"authors":[{"name":"Rand Raheem","affiliation":["Middlesex University, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Rand","lastName":"Raheem"},{"name":"Aboubaker Lasebae","affiliation":["Middlesex University, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Aboubaker","lastName":"Lasebae"},{"name":"Mahdi Aiash","affiliation":["Middlesex University, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Aiash"},{"name":"Jonathan Loo","affiliation":["Middlesex University, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Loo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4056-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4057-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7571"}],"articleNumber":"7723474","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Femtocells","Macrocell networks","Frequency conversion","OFDM","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference management","co-channel mobile femtocell technology","LTE networks","dense deployment","macrocell coverage","Long Term Evolution","mobile-femtos","vehicular networks","vehicular user equipment performance","vehicular UE performance","penetration loss","path-loss issue","co-channel deployment","spectrum scarcity","co-tire interference","adjacent femtocells","coverage planning technique","frequency reuse scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","Mobile Femtocell","Co-Channel Interference","Power control","Coverage planning","Fractional Frequency Reuse"]}],"abstract":"The dense deployment of Femtocells within the Macrocell's coverage is expected to dominate the future of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. While Mobile Femtocells (Mobile-Femtos) could be the solution for vehicular networks when there is a need to improve the vehicular User Equipment (UE) performance by mitigating the impact of penetration loss and path-loss issues. The deployed Femtocells have operated in a co-channel deployment due to the scarcity of spectrums. This issue causes interference between Femtocells and Macrocells as well it causes extra overhead on the LTE networks because of the co-tire interference between adjacent Femtocells. In this paper two interference scenarios are considered, the interference between Mobile-Femto and Macrocell, and the interference between the Mobile Femtos themselves. Therefore, to avoid the generated interference between Femtocells, the controlled transmission powers as well as the coverage planning techniques have been discussed. While in the worst-case scenarios, a frequency reuse scheme has been proposed to avoid the generated interference effectively and dynamically between the Mobile-Femtos as well as their UEs and between the Macrocell UEs.","doi":"10.1109/IE.2016.21","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717031/7723453/07723474.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IE.2016.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723453","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Management for Co-channel Mobile Femtocells Technology in LTE Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Management for Co-channel Mobile Femtocells Technology in LTE Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723474/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424984","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Management for Co-channel Mobile Femtocells Technology in LTE Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4056a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036485S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","isNumber":"7723453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717031","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7723474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723528,"authors":[{"name":"Jahanzeb Anwer","affiliation":["Paderborn University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jahanzeb","lastName":"Anwer","id":"37603777000"},{"name":"Marco Platzner","affiliation":["Paderborn University, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Platzner","id":"37265525900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723528","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"The reliability of FPGA based hardware designs has become an important field of research particularly for space computing. Traditionally, redundancy is utilized in FPGA based designs to achieve reliable or error-tolerant computing. However, the redundant designs vary according to the granularity level and the voter placement algorithms used for the hardware design. The resulting circuit configurations vary in area, latency and power as well as in the achieved reliability. While the evaluation of area, latency and power is done by the FPGA design tools, quantitative data for reliability are usually not derived. Consequently, there is a need for an automated reliability evaluation tool especially considering the huge design space of redundant circuit structures. In this paper we combine the Boolean difference error calculator (BDEC), a probabilistic reliability model for hardware designs, with a reliability model for fault-tolerant circuit structures. As a result, we are able to study the reliability of fault-tolerant circuit structures at the logic layer. We focus on fault-tolerant circuits to be implemented in FPGA and show how to extend our combined model from combinational to sequential circuits. For an automated analysis, we develop a MATLAB-based tool utilizing our extended BDEC model. An application of our automated BDEC tool has been provided with a case study on dynamic reliability management to demonstrate how such a tool providing quantitative reliability data can improve the four-dimensional Pareto optimization for area, latency, power and reliability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723528.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boolean Difference Based Reliability Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant Circuit Structures on FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Integrated circuit reliability","Integrated circuit modeling","Computational modeling","Field programmable gate arrays","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","circuit reliability","combinational circuits","electronic engineering computing","fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","Pareto optimisation","probability","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean difference based reliability evaluation","fault-tolerant circuit structure","FPGA based hardware design reliability","space computing","error-tolerant computing","redundant design","granularity level","voter placement algorithm","circuit configuration","automated reliability evaluation tool","redundant circuit structure","Boolean difference error calculator","probabilistic reliability model","logic layer","combinational circuit","sequential circuit","MATLAB-based tool","extended BDEC model","automated BDEC tool","dynamic reliability management","quantitative reliability data","4D Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Reliability","Redundancy","Boolean difference error calculator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Boolean Difference Based Reliability Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant Circuit Structures on FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723528/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413663","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boolean Difference Based Reliability Evaluation of Fault-Tolerant Circuit Structures on FPGAs","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074542S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723530,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Lalev\u00e9e","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Lalev\u00e9e","id":"37085781387"},{"name":"Pierre-Henri Horrein","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Henri","lastName":"Horrein","id":"37681907600"},{"name":"Matthieu Arzel","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Arzel","id":"37276347900"},{"name":"Michael H\u00fcbner","affiliation":["Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum - RUB, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"H\u00fcbner","id":"37300247900"},{"name":"Sandrine Vaton","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Sandrine","lastName":"Vaton","id":"37268445600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723530","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Delays","Pins","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","bitstream relocation","dynamic reconfiguration","partial reconfiguration","logic function","configuration bitstream","storage greedy approach"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic and partial reconfiguration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) enable to reuse logic resources for several applications which are scheduled in a sequential order or which are loaded on demand. A fraction of the design on the FPGA is then substituted by another logic function while the rest of the system on the chip stays unaffected. If a design provides several partial reconfigurable areas, the configuration bitstream representing the logic function to be configured in this region has to be adapted to the physical requirements of this chip area. This can be achieved by deploying a repository with all possible configuration bitstreams for all possible regions. It is obvious that storage space can quickly become a limiting parameter in reconfigurable designs. For this purpose, bitstream relocation provides a less storage greedy approach. Only one representation as bitstream of an application needs to be stored. During the configuration process, a relocation algorithm manipulates the bitstream in order to suit it to the respective reconfigurable area. However, reconfigurable regions have to fulfill strong constraints for a relocation to be possible, which makes the selection and placement of reconfigurable regions a complex process. Unfortunately this is not automated by tools so far. In this paper, an approach to automate the development of such relocatable bitstreams is presented along with new algorithms related to relocation specific steps. This approach results in functional designs with minimal intervention from the designer.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.92","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723530.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AutoReloc: Automated Design Flow for Bitstream Relocation on Xilinx FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723530/","displayDocTitle":"AutoReloc: Automated Design Flow for Bitstream Relocation on Xilinx FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413661","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723530/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AutoReloc: Automated Design Flow for Bitstream Relocation on Xilinx FPGAs","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082492S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723533,"authors":[{"name":"Rune Hylsberg Jacobsen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Aarhus University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rune Hylsberg","lastName":"Jacobsen","id":"38350798300"},{"name":"Armin Ghasem Azar","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Aarhus University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Armin Ghasem","lastName":"Azar","id":"37085613179"},{"name":"Emad Samuel Malki Ebeid","affiliation":["Aarhus Universitet, Aarhus, DK"],"firstName":"Emad Samuel Malki","lastName":"Ebeid"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723533","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an Event-Driven Residential Demand Response Infrastructure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Home appliances","Load management","Smart grids","Iron","Databases","System analysis and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demand side management","electricity supply industry","load distribution","load forecasting","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven residential demand response infrastructure","electricity load shifting","aggregator requests","balance responsible party","distribution system operator","smart grid","scalability challenges","ICT infrastructure","flexible electricity loads","European research project SEMIAH","system design","centralized load scheduling algorithm","home appliances control","power grid constraints","consumer satisfaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart grids","residential demand response","scalability","load scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Event-driven demand response programs reward consumers for shifting their electricity loads upon requests from an aggregator, a balance responsible party, or a distribution system operator. In order to have any significant impact on the smart grid, the flexibility exhibited on the demand-side needs to be aggregated from a large number of consumers. This poses significant scalability challenges for the ICT infrastructure that controls flexible electricity loads. This paper reports from the European research project SEMIAH. The project aims to design a scalable infrastructure for residential demand response. The study presents progress towards the system design of a centralized load scheduling algorithm for controlling home appliances over time. The demand response system takes the power grid constraints and satisfaction of consumers into account.

SCREAM is found to have the highest T/A ratio of these three ciphers in the Virtex-6 FPGA, while Minalpher has the highest T/A ratio in the Virtex-7 FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RTL Implementations and FPGA Benchmarking of Three Authenticated Ciphers Competing in CAESAR Round Two","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.89","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723540.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"RTL Implementations and FPGA Benchmarking of Three Authenticated Ciphers Competing in CAESAR Round Two","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723540/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413662","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RTL Implementations and FPGA Benchmarking of Three Authenticated Ciphers Competing in CAESAR Round Two","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056117S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723541,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Koppermann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Koppermann","id":"37085900892"},{"name":"Fabrizio De Santis","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"De Santis","id":"37544421600"},{"name":"Johann Heyszl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Heyszl","id":"37546348100"},{"name":"Georg Sigl","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Sigl","id":"37389947600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723541","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"abstract":"In the world of \"Internet of Things\" (IoT), millions of interconnected smart devices have to share information in a fast and secure way. In order to ensure the success and widespread adoption of IoT applications, cryptographic services must be provided to ensure secure communications and avoid skepticism about new emerging technologies. Due to its short key sizes, elliptic curve cryptography is typically deployed on resource-constrained devices in order to enable public-key cryptographic services, i.e. secure key exchanges between smart devices. In the past few years, there has been a growing interest in Curve25519 due to its elegant design aimed at both high-security and high-performance, making it one of the most promising candidates to secure IoT applications. In fact, beside providing appropriate security levels, most IoT applications must adhere to strict latency requirements and provide guarantee to process information in a tiny fraction of time. Until now Curve25519 hardware implementations were mainly optimized for high-throughput applications, while no special care was given to low-latency designs. In this work, we close this gap and provide a Curve25519 hardware design targeting low-latency applications. Our implementation takes only 13,639 cycles for a variable-base Curve25519 scalar multiplication and can be operated up to 115 MHz on Xilinx Zynq 7030 FPGA devices. This allows to compute a session key in less than 120 \u03bcs, which outperforms known FPGA-based Curve25519 implementations by a factor of 2.8, yet requiring 24 % less area resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723541.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X25519 Hardware Implementation for Low-Latency Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet of Things","Hardware","Elliptic curves","Cryptography","NIST","Smart devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X25519 hardware implementation","low-latency applications","Internet of Things","IoT","interconnected smart devices","information sharing","secure communications","elliptic curve cryptography","resource-constrained devices","public-key cryptographic services","secure key exchanges","Curve25519 hardware design","variable-base Curve25519 scalar multiplication","Xilinx Zynq 7030 FPGA devices","session key","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECC","Curve25519","FPGA","Zynq","ECDH","X25519"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"X25519 Hardware Implementation for Low-Latency Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723541/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413625","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X25519 Hardware Implementation for Low-Latency Applications","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067547S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723542,"authors":[{"name":"Dorian Amiet","affiliation":["HSR Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik, IMES Institut f\u00fcr Mikroelektronik und Embedded Systems, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dorian","lastName":"Amiet","id":"37085904997"},{"name":"Andreas Curiger","affiliation":["Securosys SA, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Curiger","id":"37376675500"},{"name":"Paul Zbinden","affiliation":["HSR Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik, IMES Institut f\u00fcr Mikroelektronik und Embedded Systems, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Zbinden","id":"37085632464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723542","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Elliptic curve cryptography","Hardware","Clocks","Digital signal processing","Elliptic curves","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","Galois fields","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible FPGA-based architectures","GF(p)","elliptic curve cryptography","ECC","private data security","public-key protocols","prime fields","hardware architecture","elliptic curve point multiplication","ECPM","Xilinx Virtex-7","DSP slices","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)","field programmable gate array (FPGA)","finite field arithmetic","Montgomery multiplication","scalable ECC processor"]}],"abstract":"Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is widely used as an efficient mechanism to secure private data using public-key protocols.

In this paper, we present NS-SRAM, for Neighborhood Solidarity SRAM, a new technique to enhance error resilience of SRAMs by exploiting the adjacent memory bit data. Bit cells of a memory line are paired together in circuit level to mutually increase the static noise margin and critical charge of a cell. Unlike existing techniques, NS-SRAM aims to enhance both Bit Error Rate (BER) and Soft Error rate (SER) at the same time. Due to auto-adaptive joiners, each of the adjacent cells' nodes is connected to its counterpart in the neighbor bit. NS-SRAM enhances read-stability by increasing critical Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM), thereby decreasing faults when circuit operates under voltage scaling. It also increases hold-stability and critical charge to mitigate soft-errors. By the proposed technique, reliability of SRAM based structures such as cache memories and register files can drastically be improved with comparable area overhead to existing hardening techniques. Moreover it does not require any extra-memory, does not impact the memory effective size, and has no negative impact on performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NS-SRAM: Neighborhood Solidarity SRAM for Reliability Enhancement of SRAM Memories","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.12","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723548.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"NS-SRAM: Neighborhood Solidarity SRAM for Reliability Enhancement of SRAM Memories","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723548/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413673","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NS-SRAM: Neighborhood Solidarity SRAM for Reliability Enhancement of SRAM Memories","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060529S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723552,"authors":[{"name":"Rodolfo Redlich","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Redlich","id":"37886556000"},{"name":"Luis Araneda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Araneda","id":"37085540697"},{"name":"Antonio Saavedra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Saavedra","id":"37085892864"},{"name":"Miguel Figueroa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Figueroa","id":"38482957200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723552","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Kernel","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer architecture","Spatial resolution","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","Gaussian processes","image reconstruction","image registration","image resolution","image sensors","image sequences","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded hardware architecture","real-time super-resolution","low-power super-resolution","infrared images","multiple-frame registration","Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm","Gaussian pyramids","custom-designed reconstruction algorithm","high-resolution image","multiple consecutive video frames","Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA","FLIR Tau 2 infrared camera core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long-wave infrared","super resolution","embedded systems","video processing","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a custom hardware architecture for fast, low-power super-resolution in infrared images.

LoRa is an example of such a long-range technology that is triggering increasing interest. Using these technologies, a trade-off must be made between power consumption and latency for message transfer from the gateway to the nodes. However, domains such as industrial applications in which sensors and actuators are part of the control loop require predictable latency, as well as low power consumption. These requirements can be fulfilled using pure-asynchronous communication and idle listening elimination, allowed by emerging ultra-low-power wake-up receivers. On the other hand, state-of-the-art wake-up receivers present low sensitivity compared to traditional wireless node receivers and LoRa, which results in the fact that they can operate in short-range in the order of a few tens of meters. In this work, we propose an energy efficient architecture that combines long-range communication with ultra low-power short-range wake-up receivers to achieve both energy efficient and low latency communication in heterogeneous long-short range networks. The proposed hardware architecture uses a single radio transceiver that can communicate using both LoRa and state-of-the-art wake-up receivers while the proposed MAC protocol exploits the benefits of these two communication schemes.

The proposed architecture provides full design time flexibility, i.e., it can accommodate any Quasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC code, and also allows redefining a number of parameters of the QC-LDPC code at the run time. The main novelty of the paper consists of: a new low-cost processing unit that merges the logical functionalities of the Variable-Node Unit (VNU) and the A Posteriori Log-Likelihood Ratio (AP-LLR) unit in an efficient way, a high speed, low-cost Check-Node Unit (CNU) architecture, which is executed twice at each iteration in order to complete the computation of the check-node messages, a splitting of the iteration processing in two perfectly symmetric stages, executed in two consecutive clock cycles, each one using exactly the same processing resources, the processing load is perfectly balanced between the two clock cycles, thus yielding an optimal clock frequency. Synthesis results targeting a 65nm CMOS technology for a (3,6)-regular (648,1296) Quasi-Cyclic LDPC code and for the WiMax (1152,2304) irregular QC-LDPC code show significant improvements in terms of area and throughput compared to the baseline architecture discussed in this paper, as well as several state of the art implementations.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.33","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723558.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible, Cost-Efficient, High-Throughput Architecture for Layered LDPC Decoders with Fully-Parallel Processing Units","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Flexible, Cost-Efficient, High-Throughput Architecture for Layered LDPC Decoders with Fully-Parallel Processing Units","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723558/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16424992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723558/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible, Cost-Efficient, High-Throughput Architecture for Layered LDPC Decoders with Fully-Parallel Processing Units","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105528S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723560,"authors":[{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723560","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723560","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Decoding","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Energy resolution","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","decoding","parity check codes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC-LDPC gear-like decoder architecture","multidomain quantization","partially-parallel QC-LDPC decoder","memory bandwidth utilization","energy efficient processing","message storage perspective","high resolution based q-bit messages","low resolution q/2-bit messages","q/2+1 resolution","check node units","BSC channel models","AWGN channel models"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes multi-domain quantization for a partially-parallel QC-LDPC decoder, which allows efficient memory bandwidth utilization.

From the message storage perspective, it uses 2 quantization modes: a high resolution based q-bit messages, and a low resolution q/2-bit messages.

In particular, the cardiovascular system is always an important target of such digital healthcare devices. In this paper, we present a neural network-based low-power online ECG analysis and monitoring system. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a representation of the heart's electrical activity recorded from electrodes on the body surface and serves as an important source of assessing heart's function. The proposed low-power design is based on the observation that a considerable amount of computations in neural network-based ECG monitoring is repetitive and can be eliminated to save power. We identify two sources of computation redundancy: the input data (which have relatively little change, as long as the heart functions properly) and neuron weights. By exploiting computation reuse to eliminate redundant computation the proposed architecture can achieve high power-efficiency for online ECG analysis which is crucial for an implant or wearable healthcare device.

This is the case of ultrasound (US) tomographic (B-mode) images used in diagnostics. A B-mode image is typically composed by many tens of vertical lines. Each line is calculated by the so-called beamformer (BF) that combines the echoes received from tens of small piezoelectric transducers integrated in the US probe. The BF processes massive quantity of data (several Gb/s) and is implemented in fast digital devices like the FPGAs. In the standard approach, the B-mode image is formed on a line-by-line basis, i.e. one line per pulse repetition interval (PRI). This limits the achievable image frame rate (IFR) to few tens of Hz, which is not suitable to detail fast, important phenomena like the heart valve movement. In the so-called plane-wave approach, the data needed to produce all of the B-mode image lines are acquired in a single PRI. In this case, the IFR can be in the order of kHz, but a more complex BF is needed. In this paper, we present a Multi-Line BF architecture, capable of real-time processing tens of lines per PRI. The BF was implemented in the research ultrasound system ULA-OP 256. A sample B-mode sequence obtained at IFR = 600Hz is presented.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.111","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723603.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance FPGA Architecture for Multi-line Beamforming in Ultrasound Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723603/","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance FPGA Architecture for Multi-line Beamforming in Ultrasound Applications","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723603/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413630","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance FPGA Architecture for Multi-line Beamforming in Ultrasound Applications","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057563S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723604,"authors":[{"name":"Vlastimil Koar","affiliation":["Vysoke uceni technicke v Brne, Brno, Moravskoslezsk\u00c3\u00bd, CZ"],"firstName":"Vlastimil","lastName":"Koar"},{"name":"Jan Korenek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Korenek","id":"37595345800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723604","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture with Atomic Configuration Updates for Flexible Regular Expressions Matching in FPGA","abstract":"Regular expressions matching is commonly used in network security devices in order to detect malicious network traffic. New network attacks and other threats are emerging frequently. Therefore, the security device must be able to update the set of used regular expressions as soon as possible. The update operation must not disrupt normal operations of the security device. Therefore, the update must be done atomically. Current reconfigurable architectures are not suitable for highly integrated embedded network security devices because they require either additional external memory, ASICs or partial reconfiguration of the FPGA. Also, architectures based on deterministic finite automaton have an exponential time complexity even for real-word sets of regular expressions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a reconfigurable architecture with atomic updates suitable for real-world sets of regular expressions. Inspired by previous designs for both ASICs and FPGAs, we propose regular expressions matching architecture with significantly lower consumption of FPGA resources than previous dynamically reconfigurable FPGA design. The proposed architecture uses an interconnection matrix with a linear space complexity, while the previous one uses an interconnection matrix with a quadratic space complexity. The proposed architecture consumes from 6.9 to 48.9 times less LUTs than previous dynamically reconfigurable FPGA design. Single matched symbol utilizes between 4.35 and 32.2 LUTs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Automata","Computer architecture","Complexity theory","Routing","Hardware","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer network security","field programmable gate arrays","finite automata","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamically reconfigurable architecture","atomic configuration updates","flexible regular expressions matching","malicious network traffic detection","network attacks","highly integrated embedded network security devices","additional external memory","ASICs","FPGA partial reconfiguration","deterministic finite automaton","exponential time complexity","interconnection matrix","linear space complexity","quadratic space complexity","single matched symbol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NFA","Regular Expressions Matching","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723604","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.109","startPage":"591","endPage":"598","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723604.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723604/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture with Atomic Configuration Updates for Flexible Regular Expressions Matching in FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16413688","htmlLink":"/document/7723604/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture with Atomic Configuration Updates for Flexible Regular Expressions Matching in FPGA","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148369S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723610,"authors":[{"name":"Tooba Arifeen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tooba","lastName":"Arifeen","id":"37085889269"},{"name":"Abdus Sami Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Abdus Sami","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37085895174"},{"name":"Hossein Moradian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Moradian","id":"37085620463"},{"name":"Jeong A.

In this flow, an end-to-end experience starting from benchmark generation to optimized inter-FPGA routing is given. For inter-FPGA routing, timing-driven approach is used instead of previously used routability-driven approach. Ten large designs are generated using generic tools of the flow and then effect of number of FPGAs on board, number of inter-FPGA tracks is observed on the performance of generated designs. Extensive experimentation reveals that FPGA board with six FPGAs gives best system frequency results. Furthermore, execution time comparison between routability and timing-driven approach reveals that compared to routability-driven approach, timing-driven approach consumes, on average, 46% less time while giving same or better frequency results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.93","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723611.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"645","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Timing-Driven Inter-FPGA Routing for Multi-FPGA Prototyping Exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Using Timing-Driven Inter-FPGA Routing for Multi-FPGA Prototyping Exploration","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7723611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413666","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723611/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Timing-Driven Inter-FPGA Routing for Multi-FPGA Prototyping Exploration","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05546S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7723612,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Andres Lara-Nino","affiliation":["Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Ciudad de M\u00c3\u00a9xico, MX"],"firstName":"Carlos Andres","lastName":"Lara-Nino"},{"name":"Miguel Morales-Sandoval","affiliation":["Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Ciudad de M\u00c3\u00a9xico, MX"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Morales-Sandoval"},{"name":"Arturo Diaz-Perez","affiliation":["Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Ciudad de M\u00c3\u00a9xico, MX"],"firstName":"Arturo","lastName":"Diaz-Perez"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723612","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel FPGA-Based Low-Cost Hardware Architecture for the PRESENT Block Cipher","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723612.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"650","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.46","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","computer architecture","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based low-cost hardware architecture","FPGA-based design","PRESENT lightweight block cipher","area-performance trade-off","area optimization","latency","FPGA resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightweight encryption","IoT","Security","FPGA","Hardware design","Low-cost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723612","abstract":"This paper presents a novel FPGA-based design for the lightweight block cipher PRESENT and its implementation results.

For instance, hardware representations of real numbers usually employ fixed-length formats defined by the IEEE Standard 754 (32-bit single-precision, 64-bit double-precision, , floating-point numbers). Fixed-length representations allow simpler and faster arithmetic units than variable-length representations. However, fixed-length representations lack the ability to adapt both their accuracy and dynamic range to the application requirements. As some variable-length representations expose this adaptivity, they allow hardware implementations to exploit this adaptivity. Recently, Unum (universal number) representation has been proposed as an extension of floating-point representations. Unum is a variable-length representation that adapts the bitsize of the representation to the actual numbers being represented and, moreover, Unum associates and propagates accuracy information through arithmetic operations. In this work we compare Unum versus the floating-point representations defined by IEEE Standard 754. We show that Unum arithmetic improves IEEE 754 arithmetic: a) results obtained using Unum arithmetic are more reliable than IEEE 754's results because Unum does not hide accuracy issues, and b) Unum arithmetic units may implement energy-efficient techniques because Unum dynamically adapts the bitsize of the representation to the actual numbers being represented.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.39","startPage":"651","endPage":"656","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723613.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unum: Adaptive Floating-Point Arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unum: Adaptive Floating-Point Arithmetic","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723613/","accessionNumber":"16413699","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723613/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unum: Adaptive Floating-Point Arithmetic","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077178S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7723614,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Deniziak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kielce University of Technology, Kielce, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Deniziak","id":"37272102900"},{"name":"Mariusz Wisniewski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kielce University of Technology, Kielce, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Wisniewski","id":"37085905080"},{"name":"Karol Wieczorek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kielce University of Technology, Kielce, Poland"],"firstName":"Karol","lastName":"Wieczorek","id":"37085414122"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723614","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivalued logical network synthesis","FPGA-oriented synthesis","field programmable gate arrays","multiple-valued network","symbolic decomposition","developmental genetic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-valued functions","FPGA","logic synthesis","developmental genetic programming"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the method of FPGA-oriented synthesis of multiple-valued logical networks. Multiple-valued network consists of modules connected by multiple-valued signals. During synthesis each module is decomposed into smaller ones, that may be implemented using one logic cell. For this purpose the symbolic decomposition is applied. Since the decomposition of modules strongly depends on encoding of multivalued inputs and outputs, the result of synthesis depends on the order, in which the consecutive modules are implemented. In our approach we optimize this order using developmental genetic programming. Experimental results showed that our approach significantly reduces the cost of implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Multivalued Logical Networks for FPGA Implementations","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.107","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723614.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Multivalued Logical Networks for FPGA Implementations","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723614/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413689","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Multivalued Logical Networks for FPGA Implementations","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076625S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723616,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Willi","affiliation":["HSR Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik Rapperswil, IMES Institut f\u00fcr Mikroelektronik und Embedded Systems, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Willi","id":"37085617140"},{"name":"Andreas Curiger","affiliation":["Securosys SA, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Curiger","id":"37376675500"},{"name":"Paul Zbinden","affiliation":["HSR Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik Rapperswil, IMES Institut f\u00fcr Mikroelektronik und Embedded Systems, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Zbinden","id":"37085632464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723616","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Power-Analysis Resistant Hardware Implementations of ECC-Based Cryptosystems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Elliptic curve cryptography","Current measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency measurement","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power analysis-based side-channel attack","PA-based side-channel attack","elliptic curve cryptography","ECC","cryptosystem","RSA encryption system","data fragmentation","data correlation","field programmable gate array","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Analysis","SPA","DPA","side channel","ECC Cryptosystem","ECDSA","FPGA","Balancing power consumption"]}],"abstract":"Power-analysis (PA) based side-channel attacks are effective methods to attack RSA encryption systems and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). In this paper, we describe PA-based side-channel attacks aiming to extract the (randomly chosen) private key for an ECC-based cryptosystem in detail. We assume that for the cryptosystem to be attacked the private key will not be available for more than one basic operation. Hence, statistical methods, commonly applied in differential power analysis attacks to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), may not be applied. To reach the required SNR for a successful attack, we have extended the analysis by frequency-selective filtering followed by data fragmentation and correlation. We show that the implementation of a \"double-and-add-always\" scheme for ECC point multiplication, which according to literature has been considered safe against simple PA, will not resist our analytical attack method. We argue that memory accesses are the root cause for a successful attack, and propose an extension of the double-and-add-always scheme to harden ECC hardware implementations adequately.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2016.59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2016.59","publicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7717032/7723516/07723616.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"On Power-Analysis Resistant Hardware Implementations of ECC-Based Cryptosystems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413684","htmlLink":"/document/7723616/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Power-Analysis Resistant Hardware Implementations of ECC-Based Cryptosystems","confLoc":"Limassol, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"2817a665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064025S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7717032","isNumber":"7723516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7717032","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7723516","articleId":"7723616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723617,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Rozkovec","affiliation":["FMMIS, Technical University in Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Rozkovec","id":"37320328100"},{"name":"Ji\u0159\u00ed \u010cech","affiliation":["FMMIS, Technical University in Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ji\u0159\u00ed","lastName":"\u010cech","id":"37085897590"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2818-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723617","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Based NUC Implemented on FPGA","abstract":"We present a hyperspectral camera system that uses realtime polynomial based non-uniformity correction (NUC).

The measurement results showed that the ROPUF with symmetric ROs is approximately two times more stable with varying temperature. We have also compared three different methods of information extraction from ROPUF based on frequency measurement. The measured results show that out of these three methods, our one is the most stable against change of temperature.

However, recent studies on micro-architectural characterization of in-memory data analytics are limited to only batch processing workloads. We compare the micro-architectural performance of batch processing and stream processing workloads in Apache Spark using hardware performance counters on a dual socket server. In our evaluation experiments, we have found that batch processing and stream processing has same micro-architectural behavior in Spark if the difference between two implementations is of micro-batching only. If the input data rates are small, stream processing workloads are front-end bound. However, the front end bound stalls are reduced at larger input data rates and instruction retirement is improved. Moreover, Spark workloads using DataFrames have improved instruction retirement over workloads using RDDs.","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.20","startPage":"59","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636704/7723653/07723674.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.20","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro-Architectural Characterization of Apache Spark on Batch and Stream Processing Workloads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Micro-Architectural Characterization of Apache Spark on Batch and Stream Processing Workloads","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723674/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16427195","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro-Architectural Characterization of Apache Spark on Batch and Stream Processing Workloads","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3936a059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079568S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636704","isNumber":"7723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636704","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7723653","articleId":"7723674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7723682,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Korytkowski","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Data Mining Lab, Czestochowa University of Technology, Czestochowa, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Korytkowski","id":"37698214800"},{"name":"Pawel Staszewski","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Data Mining Lab, Czestochowa University of Technology, Czestochowa, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Staszewski","id":"37546212300"},{"name":"Piotr Woldan","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Data Mining Lab, Czestochowa University of Technology, Czestochowa, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Woldan","id":"37085549564"},{"name":"Rafal Scherer","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Data Mining Lab, Czestochowa University of Technology, Czestochowa, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafal","lastName":"Scherer","id":"37684873800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3937-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723682","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Neurons","Convolution","Computer architecture","Kernel","Graphics processing units","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast computing framework","convolutional neural networks","propagation speed","neural structure training","OverFeat implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer vision","convolutional neural networks","software implementation","software framework"]}],"abstract":"In the case of building large convolutional neural networks, signal propagation speed is one of priority factors.

The advancements in both hardware (e.g. more powerful GPUs) and software (e.g. deep learning models, open-source frameworks and supporting libraries) have significantly improved the accuracy and training time of CNNs. However, the high speed and accuracy are at the cost of energy consumption, which has been largely ignored in previous CNN design. With the size of data sets grows exponentially, the energy demand for training such data sets increases rapidly. It is highly desirable to design deep learning frameworks and algorithms that are both accurate and energy efficient. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the power behavior and energy efficiency of numerous well-known CNNs and training frameworks on CPUs and GPUs, and we provide a detailed workload characterization to facilitate the design of energy efficient deep learning solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427226","htmlLink":"/document/7723730/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on CPUs and GPUs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on CPUs and GPUs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3936a477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078451S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636704","isNumber":"7723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636704","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7723653","articleId":"7723730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723736,"authors":[{"name":"Suk-Un Yoon","affiliation":["Advanced S/W R&D Team Visual Display, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, KOREA"],"firstName":"Suk-Un","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38239485200"},{"name":"Liang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280493400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3937-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723736","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks","Relays","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","software radio","telecommunication control","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sustainable wireless ad hoc networks","distributed topology control algorithms","reconfigurable radio topology control","reconfigurable radio dynamic topology control","minimum hop routing tree","multiple frequency bands","USRP nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficient Topology Control","Network Lifetime Extension","Reconfigurable Radio Networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Topology Control with Reconfigurable Radio for Sustainable Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723653","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636704/7723653/07723736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.82","startPage":"525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723736","abstract":"Existing topology controls enable wireless nodes to control parameters, such as adjusting the transmission power or switching operating modes between a sleep mode and an active mode, to achieve energy savings and prolong network lifetime. However, the topology controls assume that the operating frequency is fixed or can be changed in a narrow range of frequencies, thus the communication distance is not radically changed because of the radio propagation characteristic. Our thesis is that \"by introducing a new control dimension, frequency control, with an advanced radio technology, reconfigurable radio, where the transmission range can be dramatically changed by the operating frequency selection over a wide frequency range, wireless ad hoc networks can extend their network lifetime from the topology controls\". The paper presents distributed topology control algorithms, reconfigurable radio topology control (RTC) and reconfigurable radio dynamic topology control (RDTC), which construct a minimum hop routing tree using multiple frequency bands. The proposed topology control algorithms based on reconfigurable radio are implemented using USRP nodes as a proof of concept. Large scale simulation results show that the proposed topology controls can extend the network lifetime compared with the existing approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16427211","htmlLink":"/document/7723736/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Topology Control with Reconfigurable Radio for Sustainable Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Topology Control with Reconfigurable Radio for Sustainable Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3936a525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09884S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636704","isNumber":"7723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636704","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7723653","articleId":"7723736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7723747,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangbo Li","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies","High Performance Cloud Computing (HPCC), Laboratory School of Computing and Informatics University of Louisiana at, Lafayette, Louisiana, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangbo","lastName":"Li","id":"37085837032"},{"name":"Mohsen Amini Salehi","affiliation":["High Performance Cloud Computing (HPCC), Laboratory School of Computing and Informatics University of Louisiana at, Lafayette, Louisiana, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen Amini","lastName":"Salehi","id":"37085521189"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37085891930"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3936-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3937-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7723747","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723747","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Transcoding","Cloud computing","Quality of service","Delays","Scheduling","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet","quality of service","scheduling","transcoding","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video live streaming using cloud services","cloud-based architecture","video transcoding","scheduling method","QoS demands","quality of service","VLSC","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Services","Live Streaming","Scheduling","Video Transcoding"]}],"abstract":"Live streaming of video contents over the Internet generally requires conversion (i.e.,transcoding) of the video contents based on the characteristics of viewers' devices (e.g.,spatial resolution, network bandwidth, and supported codec). Due to the complexity of video transcoding process, live streaming service providers are becoming reliant on cloud services (e.g.,Amazon AWS1). With the scalable and reliable processing capability that clouds offer, live streaming service providers are able to transcode the live streams in a timely manner and fulfill viewers' Quality of Service (QoS) demands. For that purpose, cloud services must be utilized efficiently. In this paper, we present a cloud-based architecture that facilitates transcoding for live video streaming. Then, we propose a scheduling method for the architecture that is cost-efficient and satisfies viewers' QoS demands. We also propose a method -- utilized by the scheduler -- to predict the execution time of transcoding tasks before their executions. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of cloud-based transcoding for live video streams and the efficacy of the proposed scheduling method in satisfying viewers' QoS demands without imposing extra cost to the stream provider.","doi":"10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.93","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7636704/7723653/07723747.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSC: Video Live Streaming Using Cloud Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"VLSC: Video Live Streaming Using Cloud Services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427254","htmlLink":"/document/7723747/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSC: Video Live Streaming Using Cloud Services","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3936a595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066035S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7636704","isNumber":"7723653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7636704","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7723653","articleId":"7723747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723793,"authors":[{"name":"Tianwei Zhang","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Tianwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38560530600"},{"name":"Ruby B.

Continuous authentication has been explored as an approach for alleviating such concerns. Previous methods for continuous authentication primarily use biometrics, e.g., fingerprint and face recognition, or behaviometrics, e.g., key stroke patterns. We describe CABA, a novel continuous authentication system that is inspired by and leverages the emergence of sensors for pervasive and continuous health monitoring. CABA authenticates users based on their BioAura, an ensemble of biomedical signal streams that can be collected continuously and non-invasively using wearable medical devices. While each such signal may not be highly discriminative by itself, we demonstrate that a collection of such signals, along with robust machine learning, can provide high accuracy levels. We demonstrate the feasibility of CABA through analysis of traces from the MIMIC-II dataset. We propose various applications of CABA, and describe how it can be extended to user identification and adaptive access control authorization. Finally, we discuss possible attacks on the proposed scheme and suggest corresponding countermeasures.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2622262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2622262","startPage":"759","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7893086/07723816.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7893086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CABA: Continuous Authentication Based on BioAura","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/12/7893086/7723816-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"CABA: Continuous Authentication Based on BioAura","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16824250","publicationDate":"1 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7723816/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1219570"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006734","fundingName":"Princeton University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"CABA: Continuous Authentication Based on BioAura","sourcePdf":"tc-mosenia-2622262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201775S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7893086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7893086","articleId":"7723816","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723817,"authors":[{"name":"Taewoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7723817/lee-2622252-small.gif","p":["Taewoo Lee was born in Pohang, South Korea, in 1981.

However, when it is combined with high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for higher bandwidth efficiency, the SC-FDMA signal also exhibits relatively high PAPR, and thus, the resulting efficiency of power amplifier (PA) will be considerably reduced. Since PA is a dominant source of power consumption at the transmitter, further reduction of PAPR should be necessary in view of future green cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new trellis shaping (TS) design for peak power reduction of SC-FDMA signals. We first observe that the direct application of the TS developed for peak power reduction of conventional single-carrier signals tends to incur high peaks at the edges of each SC-FDMA signal due to their circularly periodic structure. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel modification of TS such that the symbols at one edge can be controlled by those located at the other edge. It is shown that the SC-FDMA signal with the proposed TS is able to significantly improve the PA efficiency. We demonstrate its effectiveness by investigating system level performances, such as the achievable PA efficiency and resulting power spectral density, as well as its symbol error rate (SER) over additive white Gaussian noise channels with frequency-selective Rayleigh fading in the presence of PA nonlinearity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07723817.pdf","startPage":"5030","endPage":"5042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2622252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2622252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Trellis Shaping Design for Peak Power Reduction of SC-FDMA Signals With High-Order QAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Frequency-domain analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Phase shift keying","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency division multiple access","Gaussian noise","mobile communication","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["new trellis shaping design","peak power reduction","SC-FDMA signals","high order QAM","single carrier frequency division multiple-access","uplink radio access scheme","fourth-generation mobile wireless communication system","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","power amplifier","PA","green cellular systems","single-carrier signals","power spectral density","symbol error rate","SER","additive white Gaussian noise channels","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading","PA nonlinearity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","single-carrier frequency-division multiple-access (SC-FDMA)","trellis shaping (TS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A New Trellis Shaping Design for Peak Power Reduction of SC-FDMA Signals With High-Order QAM","volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7723817/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965050","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Trellis Shaping Design for Peak Power Reduction of SC-FDMA Signals With High-Order QAM","sourcePdf":"tvt-ochiai-2622252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091929S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7723817","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7723829,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo E.

This paper investigates the use of a buck converter to regulate the input voltage to a fixed frequency unidirectional switch push-pull converter to meet the requirements of dynamic charging. The presented circuit is optimized to remove some of the additional components introduced. A mathematical model is presented that shows the circuit is capable of operating while extremely mistuned in both the inductive and capacitive regions while maintaining sinusoidal currents. A controller design is also presented allowing constant primary current operation, safe start up, and operation under no load conditions. A 5-kW prototype was built and validated when operated with a dynamic load under severely mistuned conditions.","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7909058/07723833.pdf","startPage":"6689","endPage":"6699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2622300","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2622300","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723833","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Power supplies","Topology","Inductors","Switching circuits","Inductance","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging","inductive power transmission","mathematical analysis","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["roadway wireless power systems","inductive power transfer power supplies","electric vehicle charging","buck converter","push-pull converter","dynamic charging","mathematical model","sinusoidal currents","power 5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Highway charging","inductive power transfer","push\u2013pull converter","wireless power transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Mistuning-Tolerant and Controllable Power Supply for Roadway Wireless Power Systems","accessionNumber":"16838260","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7723833/","volume":"32","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mistuning-Tolerant and Controllable Power Supply for Roadway Wireless Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-kamineni-2622300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108953S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7909058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7909058","articleId":"7723833","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7723834,"authors":[{"name":"Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou","affiliation":["Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8000754/7723834/eirin-2622263-small.gif","p":["Eirini Eleni Tsiropoulou received the diploma degree, the MBA degree\n in techno-economics, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University\n of Athens, in 2008, 2010, and 2014, respectively.

Each user-either macrocell (MUE) or femtocell user equipment (FUE)-is associated with a two-variable utility function that represents his perceived satisfaction with respect to his allocated resources (i.e., power and rate). User's utility function is differentiated based both on the tier that the user belongs to and the service he requests. The joint resource allocation problem is directly confronted as a two-variable optimization problem and formulated as a non-cooperative game. The theory of supermodular games is utilized towards treating the two-variable optimization problem and the inherent multidimensional competition that arises among the users. The existence of proposed game's Nash Equilibrium (NE) point is analytically shown, while game's convergence to its NE point is proven. A distributed and iterative algorithm for computing the desired NE is introduced, where the optimal values of each user's uplink transmission power and data rate are simultaneously updated at the same step. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via modeling and simulation and its superiority compared to other state of the art approaches is illustrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supermodular Game-Based Distributed Joint Uplink Power and Rate Allocation in Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2016.2622263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8000754/07723834.pdf","startPage":"2656","endPage":"2667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2016.2622263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Supermodular Game-Based Distributed Joint Uplink Power and Rate Allocation in Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7723834/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17149437","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supermodular Game-Based Distributed Joint Uplink Power and Rate Allocation in Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-papavassiliou-2622263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098231S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8000754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8000754","articleId":"7723834","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7723836,"authors":[{"name":"Guimei Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Air and Missile Defense College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Guimei","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0001-9779-6014","id":"37085803087"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7723836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":865},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Covariance matrices","MIMO radar","Signal to noise ratio","Colored noise","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitted signal covariance matrix","colored noise","prewhitening processing","signal model","steering matrix","non POWS","nonperfectly orthogonal waveform signals","multiple input multiple output radar","MIMO radar","direction-of-arrival estimation","DOA estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival (DOA)","MIMO radar","non-perfectly orthogonal waveforms","spatially colored noise"]}],"abstract":"In direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar, many existing publications deal with perfectly orthogonal waveform signals (POWS). But in practice, it is a real challenge to generate POWS. In this letter, we study DOA estimation in MIMO radar with the case of non-perfectly orthogonal waveform signals (Non-POWS). A two-step algorithm is proposed. The first step is to blend the covariance matrix of Non-POWS into the steering matrix to set up a new signal model similar to the POWS model. The second step is to perform pre-whitening processing for the colored noise produced by Non-POWS utilizing known transmitted signal covariance matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the Non-POWS degrades the DOA estimation performance and 2) our method can solve this problem well.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2622691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2622691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07723836.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar With Non-Perfectly Orthogonal Waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar With Non-Perfectly Orthogonal Waveforms","volume":"21","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723836/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668388","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501504"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M581097"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar With Non-Perfectly Orthogonal Waveforms","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zheng-2622691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05266S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7723836","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723838,"authors":[{"name":"Haixia Peng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7723838/peng-2621618-small.gif","p":["Haixia Peng (S\u201915) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science and Engineering.

To this end, we propose two self-organizing schemes for LS-WSNs. The first scheme is the energy-aware common neighbor scheme, which considers the neighborhood overlap in link establishment. The second scheme is energy-aware low potential-degree common neighbor (ELDCN) scheme, which considers both neighborhood overlap in topology formation and the potential degrees of common neighbors. Both schemes generate clustering-based and scale-free-inspired LS-WSNs, which are energy-efficient and robust. However, the ELDCN scheme shows higher energy efficiency and stronger robustness to node failures, because it avoids establishing links to hub-nodes with high potential connectivity.

Most of the works use data obtained either from the time domain or by applying advanced techniques in the frequency domain. Some researchers have employed a considerable effort in designing sophisticated algorithms to achieve the best performance of the diagnosis system. However, some contributions in the field have not taken advantage of the benefits that a good evaluation stage can bring to the developing of classifiers for fault diagnosis. In this paper, novel insights for the classifier evaluation are presented to promote better assessment practices in the field of electric machine diagnosis based on supervised classification. A case of study consisting of a motor with a broken rotor bar is described to analyze the performance of two classifiers by using scores focused on the fault detection. Also, different error estimation methods are considered to obtain unbiased predictive performances. Two statistical tests are also discussed to confirm the significance of the results under a single data set.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Classification algorithms","Performance evaluation","Rotors","Iinduction motors","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motors","pattern classification","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classifier evaluation","electric data-driven motor diagnosis","electric machine diagnosis","supervised classification","broken rotor bar","fault detection","error estimation methods","unbiased predictive performances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broken rotor bar","classification algorithm","condition monitoring","electric machines","fault diagnosis","performance evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07723846.pdf","startPage":"7028","endPage":"7038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in Classifier Evaluation: Novel Insights for an Electric Data-Driven Motor Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advances in Classifier Evaluation: Novel Insights for an Electric Data-Driven Motor Diagnosis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723846/","volume":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723846/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16470561","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006054","fundingName":"Universidad de Guanajuato, DAIP","grantNumber":"733/2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007350","fundingName":"Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)","grantNumber":"598078"},{"fundingName":"Mobility Grant from the University of Valladolid, Spain"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad and FEDER Program in the framework of the Proyectos I+D del Subprograma de Generaci\u00f3n de Conocimiento, Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y T\u00e9cnica de Excelencia","grantNumber":"DPI2014-52842-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Advances in Classifier Evaluation: Novel Insights for an Electric Data-Driven Motor Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"access-romerotroncoso-2622679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088156S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7723846","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7723847,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangjie Fu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/8861194/7723847/fu-2622697-small.gif","p":["Zhangjie Fu received the PhD degree in computer science from the College of Computer, Hunan University, China, in 2012.

The existing achievements are mainly focused on keyword-based search schemes, and almost all of them depend on predefined keywords extracted in the phases of index construction and query. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users' retrieval and cannot completely match users' search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problems of semantic search based on conceptual graphs (CGs) over encrypted outsourced data in clouding computing (SSCG). We first employ the efficient measure of \u201csentence scoring\u201d in text summarization and Tregex to extract the most important and simplified topic sentences from documents. We then convert these simplified sentences into CGs. To perform quantitative calculation of CGs, we design a new method that can map CGs to vectors. Next, we rank the returned results based on \u201ctext summarization score\u201d. Furthermore, we propose a basic idea for SSCG and give a significantly improved scheme to satisfy the security guarantee of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). Finally, we choose a real-world dataset, i.e., the CNN dataset to test our scheme. The results obtained from the experiment show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8861194/07723847.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8861194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2016.2622697","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2016.2622697","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723847","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Servers","Indexes","Encryption","Cloud computing","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","information filtering","natural language processing","outsourcing","query processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["important topic sentences","simplified topic sentences","CG","searchable symmetric encryption","enabling semantic search","conceptual graphs","encrypted outsourced data","searchable encryption","cloud computing","keyword-based search schemes","content-based search scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Searchable encryption","cloud computing","ranked search","semantic search","conceptual graphs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723847/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Semantic Search Based on Conceptual Graphs over Encrypted Outsourced Data","accessionNumber":"19115361","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2019","publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7723847/","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61232016, 61373133, U1536206, U1405254, 61502242 and 61300238"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012246","fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology"},{"fundingName":"Qing Lan Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Semantic Search Based on Conceptual Graphs over Encrypted Outsourced Data","sourcePdf":"tsc-huang-2622697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158231S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8861194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8861194","articleId":"7723847","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7723851,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Wachter-Zeh","affiliation":["The author was with the Computer Science Department, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel","Institute for Communications Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Antonia Wachter-Zeh (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) is an Assistant Professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich Germany.

The modulation used is ON-OFF keying, with symbol-by-symbol single-user detection. A ray tracing propagation model is assumed with knowledge at the base station and transmitters of only the ray arrival angles and amplitudes. We identify the sources of performance degradation, quantify notions of diversity gain (related to the detection error performance) and multiplexing gain (related to the number of users simultaneously supported), and present numerical results to demonstrate these gains. Our results indicate that in this noncoherent system, increasing the number of antenna elements can support multiple users, with a vanishing probability of detection error, as long as the number of users is below a certain threshold which increases with the number of antennas. This contrasts with the fact that in a rich scattering propagation environment, uncoded noncoherent systems performing symbol-by-symbol detection cannot support more than one user with a vanishing probability of error.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07723854.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2622237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2622237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplexing and Diversity Gains in Noncoherent Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","MIMO","Fading channels","Scattering","Receivers","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing","diversity gains","noncoherent massive MIMO systems","noncoherent uplink","noncoherent downlink","ON-OFF keying","symbol-by-symbol single-user detection","performance degradation","detection error performance","antenna elements","scattering propagation environment","symbol-by-symbol detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","noncoherent communications","multiuser systems"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7809190/7723854-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multiplexing and Diversity Gains in Noncoherent Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7723854/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618431","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"3Com Corporation"},{"fundingName":"Alcatel-Lucent Stanford Graduate Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF Center for Science of Information","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-0939370"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004117","fundingName":"A.G.

Therefore, in such cases, a targeted e-Health solution to safeguard patient long-term health could be a meaningful approach. Today's modern healthcare technologies, often built around electronic and computer-based equipment, require an access to a reliable electricity supply. Many healthcare technologies and products also presume access to the high speed internet is available, making them unsuitable for use in areas where there is no fixed-line internet connectivity, access is slow, unreliable, and expensive, yet where the most benefit to patients may be gained. In this paper, a full mobile sensor platform is presented, based around readily-purchased consumer components, to facilitate a low cost and efficient means of monitoring the health of patients with prosthetic lower limbs. This platform is designed such that it can also be operated in a standalone mode, i.e., in the absence of internet connectivity, thereby making it suitable to the developing world. Also, to counter the challenge of power supply issues in e-Health monitoring, a self-contained rechargeable solution to the platform is proposed and demonstrated. The platform works with an Android mobile device, in order to allow for the capture of data from a wireless sensor unit, and to give the clinician access to results from the sensors. The results from the analysis, carried out within the platform's Raspberry Pi Zero, are demonstrated to be of use for remote monitoring. This is specifically targeted for monitoring the tissue health of lower limb amputees. The monitoring of residual limb temperature and gait can be a useful indicator of tissue viability in lower limb amputees especially those suffering from diabetes. We describe a route wherein non-invasive monitoring of tissue health is achievable using the Gaussian process technique. This knowledge will be useful in establishing biomarkers related to a possible deterioration in a patient's health or for assessing the impact of clinical interventions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622163","startPage":"7440","endPage":"7451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07723857.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Design and Implementation of a Low Cost Platform for Remote Monitoring of Lower Limb Health of Amputees in the Developing World","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Design and Implementation of a Low Cost Platform for Remote Monitoring of Lower Limb Health of Amputees in the Developing World","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723857/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16470552","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723857/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the Doctoral Training","grantNumber":"EP/K503174/1"},{"fundingName":"Centre for Excellence in Rehabilitation Research (CERR)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Practical Design and Implementation of a Low Cost Platform for Remote Monitoring of Lower Limb Health of Amputees in the Developing World","sourcePdf":"access-mathur-2622163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082454S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7723857","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7723864,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Pepe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7835743/7723864/pepe-2604008-small.gif","p":["\n\nFederico Pepe was born in Italy in 1985.

In the underlying tier, the transmitter sends unclassified information and the receiver works in the half-duplex (HD) mode receiving the desired signal. In the overlaid tier, the transmitter delivers confidential information in the presence of randomly located eavesdroppers, and the receiver works in the FD mode radiating jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers and receiving the desired signal simultaneously. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis and network design under a stochastic geometry framework. Specifically, we consider the scenarios where each FD receiver uses single- and multi-antenna jamming, and analyze the connection probability and the secrecy outage probability of a typical FD receiver by deriving accurate expressions and more tractable approximations for the two probabilities. We also determine the optimal deployment density of the FD-mode tier to maximize the network-wide secrecy throughput subject to constraints including the given dual probabilities and the network-wide throughput of the HD-mode tier. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our theoretical findings, and show that the network-wide secrecy throughput is significantly improved by properly deploying the FD-mode tier.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2622689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07723867.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2622689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safeguarding Decentralized Wireless Networks Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Safeguarding Decentralized Wireless Networks Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723867/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618465","htmlLink":"/document/7723867/","volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A708"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671364"},{"fundingName":"Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201340"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Support Fund of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-01"},{"fundingName":"MEST, NRF, Korea","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A1A05000977"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safeguarding Decentralized Wireless Networks Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers","sourcePdf":"twc-zheng-2622689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204297S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7723867","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7723870,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwu Yan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7895231/7723870/yan-2622668-small.gif","p":["Weiwu Yan received the M.S. degree in material science and\n engineering from the Lanzhou University of Science and Technology, Lanzhou, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in\n control science and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2003.","In 2003, he became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he\n became an Associate Professor in 2006.

The core issue of data-driven soft sensors is building soft sensor models with excellent performance and robustness. This paper introduces deep learning to soft sensor modeling and proposes a novel soft sensor modeling method based on a deep learning network that integrates denoising autoencoders with a neural network (DAE-NN). An improved gradient descent is employed to update the model parameters. The proposed modeling method is able to capture the essential information of input data through deep architecture, building soft sensors with excellent performance. The DAE-NN-based soft sensor is applied in practical applications to estimate the oxygen content in flue gasses in 1000-MW ultrasuperficial units. Comparing conventional soft sensor modeling methods, i.e., shallow learning methods, DAE-NN-based soft sensor significantly improves the performance and generalization of data-driven soft sensors. Deep learning provides a very effective and promising method for soft sensor modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16808757","htmlLink":"/document/7723870/","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Soft Sensor Modeling Method Based on Deep Learning and its Application","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"60974119"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Soft Sensor Modeling Method Based on Deep Learning and its Application","sourcePdf":"tie-yan-2622668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072973S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7895231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"7895231","articleId":"7723870","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7723871,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7723871/cui-2622236-small.gif","p":["Ying Cui (S\u201909\u2013M\u201911) received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiao Tong University, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2011.

Caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations (BSs) are two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul load in HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider caching and multicasting in a large-scale cache-enabled HetNet with backhaul constraints. We propose a hybrid caching design consisting of identical caching in the macro-tier and random caching in the pico-tier, and a corresponding multicasting design. By carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate approximations, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission probability in the general signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and user density region as well as the high SNR and user density region, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing design parameters, which is a very challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. By exploring structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with superior performance and manageable complexity. This solution achieves better performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution, under a mild condition. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable design insights for practical cache-enabled HetNets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618442","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7723871/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Caching and Multicasting in Large-Scale Cache-Enabled Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401272"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimization of Caching and Multicasting in Large-Scale Cache-Enabled Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-cui-2622236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119397S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7723871","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7723873,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Jun Chen","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi\u2019an, China","Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Jun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085669057"},{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi\u2019an, China","Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-2773-3437","id":"37275877700"},{"name":"Ying Luo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan University, Shanghai, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi\u2019an, China","Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Luo","id":"37533390500"},{"name":"Yong-An Chen","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi\u2019an, China","Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yong-An","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085461252"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7723873","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":527},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Sparse matrices","Biological cells","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Radar imaging","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","genetic algorithms","image reconstruction","iterative methods","matrix algebra","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISAR sparse imaging","computation load","signal reconstruction","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","optimized measurement matrix","target characteristics","physical observation process","genetic algorithm","measurement matrix optimization method","stepped frequency","target imaging","measurement matrix","compressive sensing","inverse synthetic aperture radar sparse imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm (GA)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) sparse imaging","measurement matrix optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2616352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2616352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7778340/07723873.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement Matrix Optimization for ISAR Sparse Imaging Based on Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"Inverse synthetic aperture radar sparse imaging based on compressive sensing has been widely researched.

sites along tortuous anatomical paths under constrained environments and enable to perform complex and delicate operations through small incisions in minimally invasive surgery. These advantages enable their broad applications with minimal trauma and make challenging clinical procedures possible with miniaturized instrumentation and high curvilinear access capabilities. However, their inherent deformable designs make it difficult to realize 3-D intraoperative real-time shape sensing to accurately model their shape. Solutions to this limitation can lead themselves to further develop closely associated techniques of closed-loop control, path planning, human-robot interaction, and surgical manipulation safety concerns in minimally invasive surgery. Although extensive model-based research that relies on kinematics and mechanics has been performed, accurate shape sensing of continuum robots remains challenging, particularly in cases of unknown and dynamic payloads. This survey investigates the recent advances in alternative emerging techniques for 3-D shape sensing in this field and focuses on the following categories: fiber-optic-sensor-based, electromagnetic-tracking-based, and intraoperative imaging modality-based shape-reconstruction methods. The limitations of existing technologies and prospects of new technologies are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2016.2622361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7981410/07723875.pdf","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2016.2622361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape Sensing Techniques for Continuum Robots in Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Shape Sensing Techniques for Continuum Robots in Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Survey","volume":"64","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17015676","pubMedId":"27810796","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7723875/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723875/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore Academic Research Fund","grantNumber":"R-397-000-227-112"},{"fundingName":"NMRC Bedside & Bench","grantNumber":"R-397-000-245-511"},{"fundingName":"Singapore Millennium Foundation","grantNumber":"R-397-000-201-592"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Sensing Techniques for Continuum Robots in Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tbme-shi-2622361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16485S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7981410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7981410","articleId":"7723875","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7723882,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Khoshkbar Sadigh","affiliation":["Extron Electronics, Anaheim, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7895231/7723882/sadig-2614267-small.gif","p":["Arash Khoshkbar Sadigh (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the\n B.S. and M.S. degrees (both with first honors) in electrical engineering from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran,\n in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California,\n Irvine, CA, USA, in 2014.","From 2007 to 2010, he was with the AranNagshAra Consultant Engineering Company, Tabriz, Iran, where he was involved\n in the design of power transmission and distribution lines.

In managing the Kriging models, the algorithm focuses on the balance of diversity and convergence by making use of the uncertainty information in the approximated objective values given by the Kriging models, the distribution of the reference vectors as well as the location of the individuals. In addition, we design a strategy for choosing data for training the Kriging model to limit the computation time without impairing the approximation accuracy.

Unsupervised domain-adaptation techniques consider two different but related domains: a source domain with ample number of labeled samples and a target domain with no labeled data. The task at hand is to build an inference model exploring the available data that is expected to work consistently well in both the domains. This is a challenging problem, since the probability distributions governing both the domains are substantially different leading to the violation of the probably approximate correct assumptions of statistical learning theory. We consider an even complex scenario in this letter by assuming the absence of source domain training samples in the learning process. Our algorithm broadly consists of two stages: first, data from both the domains are projected into a common subspace using geodesic flow kernel in a Grassmannian manifold, and we further propose an iterative coclustering technique to obtain the consistent clustering outcomes for both the domains in the newly defined space. In line with the traditional domain-adaptation approaches, we also consider that both the domains contain the same set of semantic land-cover classes. The proposed method is simple, scalable, and results in highly precise clustering outputs for standard RS data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7723884/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16524385","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Domain Adaptation in the Absence of Source Domain Labeled Samples\u2014A Coclustering-Based Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain Adaptation in the Absence of Source Domain Labeled Samples\u2014A Coclustering-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"lgrs-banerjee-2617199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052791S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7778340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7778340","articleId":"7723884","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7723886,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Su\u00e1rez","affiliation":["Atomos GmbH, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7723886/suare-2610580-small.gif","p":["Manuel Su\u00e1rez received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the Ph.D. (Hons.) degree in information and telecommunication technologies from the University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, in 2008 and 2015, respectively, where the research was done with the Centro Singular de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n in collaboration with the Institute of Microelectronics of Seville (IMSE-CNM-CSIC), Seville, Spain.","Currently, he is an Analog Designer with Atomos GmbH, Montabaur, Germany.

Joint estimation of these impairments is necessary in order to correctly decode the received signal at the destination. In this paper, we address spectrally efficient multi-relay transmission scenarios where all the relays simultaneously communicate with the destination. We propose an iterative pilot-aided algorithm based on the expectation conditional maximization for joint estimation of multipath channels, Wiener PHNs, and CFOs in decode-and-forward-based multi-relay orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. Next, a new expression of the hybrid Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (HCRB) for the multi-parameter estimation problem is derived. Finally, an iterative receiver based on an extended Kalman filter for joint data detection and PHN tracking is employed. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms existing algorithms and its mean square error performance is close to the derived HCRB at different signal-to-noise ratios for different PHN variances. In addition, the combined estimation algorithm and the iterative receiver can significantly improve average bit-error rate (BER) performance compared with existing algorithms. In addition, the BER performance of the proposed system is close to the ideal case of perfect channel impulse responses, PHNs, and CFOs estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2622704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2622704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07723889.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Relay Communications in the Presence of Phase Noise and Carrier Frequency Offsets","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7818052/7723889-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Relay Communications in the Presence of Phase Noise and Carrier Frequency Offsets","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723889/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598319","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723889/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation EARS","grantNumber":"1642865"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multi-Relay Communications in the Presence of Phase Noise and Carrier Frequency Offsets","sourcePdf":"tcomm-salim-2622704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139378S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7723889","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723891,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhat Thakur","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, India"],"firstName":"Prabhat","lastName":"Thakur","id":"37085996698"},{"name":"Alok Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, India"],"firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085989692"},{"name":"S.

In long term evolution-advanced, the number of physical resource blocks (PRBs) are used to gauge the users' needs. Accordingly, there is a time in the network when it is beneficial to gain the advantages of consuming the unused PRBs in the transport block (TB) context to operate at a significantly lower power cost per PRB. The novelty of the letter is that the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standard tables are used with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing mode, to control the transport block size (TBS) index. This can be done by setting more PRBs and hence changing the modulation order that leads to reducing the transmitted power. In addition to that, MIMO layers, the prerequisite throughput, the intercell interference as well as the channel conditions of each user are considered as constraints to improve the downlink power efficiency. To describe the above-stated problem, an optimization problem is formulated as binary integer nonlinear program, which is very difficult to solve. Thus, a reformulation linearization technique based on a branch-and-bound framework is used to simplify the aforementioned BINLP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7604153/07723903.pdf","startPage":"1796","endPage":"1800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2622479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2622479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Efficient Transport Blocks Management on the Downlink Power in MIMO Spatial Multiplexing of LTE-A","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Indexes","Multiplexing","3GPP","Optimization","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","optimisation","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport block management","downlink power","MIMO spatial multiplexing","LTE-A","physical resource blocks","PRB","transport block","multiple-input-multiple-output spatial multiplexing mode","intercell interference","optimization problem","binary integer nonlinear program","branch-and-bound framework","mobile operators","3rd generation partnership project standard","BINLP","reformulation linearization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A)","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","spatial multiplexing (SM)","transport block (TB)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Efficient Transport Blocks Management on the Downlink Power in MIMO Spatial Multiplexing of LTE-A","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7723903/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16442120","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Efficient Transport Blocks Management on the Downlink Power in MIMO Spatial Multiplexing of LTE-A","sourcePdf":"lsp-aldoori-2622479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082255S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7604153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7604153","articleId":"7723903","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7723907,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Meng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/7723907/meng-2622259-small.gif","p":["Xin Meng (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.E. degree from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2009, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.

To reduce the burden of the downlink channel estimation and achieve partial spatial diversity from base station (BS) transmit antennas, we propose channel-independently precoded low-dimensional STBC. The precoding matrix and the signal constellation in the low-dimensional STBC are jointly designed to guarantee omnidirectional coverage at any instant time and sufficiently utilize the power amplifier capacities of BS transmit antennas, and at the same time, achieve the full diversity of the low-dimensional STBC. Under this framework, several designs are presented. To provide transmit diversity order of two, a precoded Alamouti code is proposed, which has a fast symbolwise maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. To provide transmit diversity order of four, a precoded quasi-orthogonal STBC is proposed, which has a pairwise ML decoding. Moreover, a precoded no-zero-entry Toeplitz code and a precoded no-zero-entry overlapped Alamouti code are also proposed. These two codes can achieve a higher diversity order with linear receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidirectional Space-Time Block Coding for Common Information Broadcasting in Massive MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2622259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/07723907.pdf","startPage":"1407","endPage":"1417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2622259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","xploreNote":"IEEE Xplore Notice to Reader: The article \"Omnidirectional Space-Time Block Coding for Common Information Broadcasting in Massive MIMO Systems\" by Xin Meng, Xiang-Gen Xia, and Xiqi Gao published in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications Early Access Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/TWC.2016.2622259 has discrepancies between the accepted file and the final submitted file.

With respect to PNC operated with CM, we consider network coding-based channel decoding (NC-CD) and multi-user complete decoding (MUD-NC) for PNC decoding at the relay. Their BICM counterparts are XOR-based channel decoding (XOR-CD) and MUD-XOR, respectively. First, we show that, when the decoding is non-iterative, there is a gap between the BICM capacities of both XOR-CD and MUD-XOR under Gray mapping and the capacities of their CM counterparts, NC-CD, and MUD-NC. This is in contrast to the conventional point-to-point communication system, for which the BICM capacity with Gray mapping is known to be very close to the CM capacity, without the need for iterative decoding. Second, we investigate the error performance of iteratively decoded BICM XOR-CD and MUD-XOR. Extrinsic information transfer chart analysis and simulation results indicate that for these Gray-mapped BICM PNC systems, iterative decoding can achieve considerable gains over non-iterative decoding. Again, this is in contrast to the Gray-mapped BICM point-to-point communication system, for which iterative decoding provides little gain over non-iterative decoding. We further show that Gray mapping gives rise to best PNC rate for MUD-XOR and XOR-CD systems among several bits-to-symbol mappings under study. Overall, our results indicate that BICM PNC systems exhibit different decoding behavior from conventional BICM point-to-point systems. This paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of this issue.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2622693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07723910.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2622693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth-Efficient Coded Modulation Schemes for Physical-Layer Network Coding with High-Order Modulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth-Efficient Coded Modulation Schemes for Physical-Layer Network Coding with High-Order Modulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723910/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16598310","htmlLink":"/document/7723910/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"General Research Fund","grantNumber":"414713"},{"fundingName":"AoE established under the University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"E-02/08"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401099 and FuZhou 2015-G-61"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth-Efficient Coded Modulation Schemes for Physical-Layer Network Coding with High-Order Modulations","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shi-2622693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109481S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7723910","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723911,"authors":[{"name":"Duygu Bayram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7931767/7723911/bayra-2622231-small.gif","p":["Duygu Bayram (M'12) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees\n from the Electrical and Electronics Faculty of Istanbul Technical University (ITU), \u0130stanbul, Turkey, in 2006,\n 2009, and 2015, respectively.","She was a Research Assistant in ITU between 2007 and 2015.

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, first artificial motor vibration data are produced and used as a base line for analysis and assessment of the methodology. After successfully confirming proof of concept by detecting all fault frequencies hidden within the artificial data, the approach is then applied to the experimental data to see whether it can be accepted as a suitable potential fault detection tool for healthy electric motors. As the keystone of the study, algebraic summation operation (ASO) is introduced for predictive fault detection. ASO is built and based upon the redundant nature of stationary wavelet transform (SWT). Although similar to the SWT, the down sampling operation defined for the perfect reconstruction of SWT is omitted in ASO to amplify the redundancy within the transform. In other words, the redundancy obtained during decomposition is conserved on purpose with the goal of amplifying potential fault frequencies in electric motor vibration spectra and allowing for more robust and predictive fault detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7931767/07723911.pdf","startPage":"2997","endPage":"3004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2016.2622231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2016.2622231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7931767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundancy-Based Predictive Fault Detection on Electric Motors by Stationary Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Transforms","Redundancy","Vibrations","Circuit faults","Electric motors","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","fault diagnosis","sampling methods","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundancy-based predictive fault detection","electric motors","stationary wavelet transform","signal-based predictive fault-detection approach","artificial motor vibration data","fault frequencies","healthy electric motors","algebraic summation operation","ASO","predictive fault detection","SWT","down sampling operation","potential fault frequencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric motors","fault detection","redundancy, stationary wavelet transform (SWT)","vibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Redundancy-Based Predictive Fault Detection on Electric Motors by Stationary Wavelet Transform","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7723911/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16898646","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundancy-Based Predictive Fault Detection on Electric Motors by Stationary Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tia-bayram-2622231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088812S","chronDate":"May-June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7931767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7931767","articleId":"7723911","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7723913,"authors":[{"name":"Xibo Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7812803/7723913/yuan-2615264-small.gif","p":["Xibo Yuan (S'09\u2013M'11\u2013SM'15) received the B.S. degree from\n the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing,\n China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","Since 2016, he has been a Reader in the Electrical Energy Management Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic\n Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., where he became a Lecturer and a Senior Lecturer in 2011 and 2015,\n respectively.

At a cost of slightly lengthened code symbols, the involved message symbols in each batch of the proposed codes can be recovered by low complexity zigzag decoding algorithm. Thus, the proposed codes have low buffer occupancy during decoding process. These features are suitable for broadcasting to receivers with limited hardware resources. We also propose a method to obtain degree distributions of code symbols for the proposed codes via ripple size evolution by taking into account the released code symbols from the batches.

Silicon Photonics appears today a promising solution towards these goals. The inability of photonics networks to perform inflight buffering and logic computation suggests the use of hybrid photonic-electronic architectures. In order to exploit the full potential of photonics, it is essential to carefully design the path-setup architecture, which is a primary source of performance degradation and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a new path-setup approach which can put allocated circuits in a stand-by state, rapidly restoring them when needed. Path-setup messages are sent using a flooding routing strategy to enhance the possibility of finding free optical paths. We compare the proposed approach with a commonly used path-setup strategy as well as some other alternatives available. The results exhibit encouraging improvements in terms of both performance and energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2016.2622265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7894348/07723923.pdf","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2016.2622265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Setup for Hybrid NoC Architectures Exploiting Flooding and Standby","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7723923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Path Setup for Hybrid NoC Architectures Exploiting Flooding and Standby","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723923/","publicationDate":"1 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16850147","htmlLink":"/document/7723923/","volume":"28","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Setup for Hybrid NoC Architectures Exploiting Flooding and Standby","sourcePdf":"tpds-fusella-2622265-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089663S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7894348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7894348","articleId":"7723923","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7723927,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7982827/7723927/hu-2618866-small.gif","p":["Miao Hu (M\u201913) received the B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, New York, NY, USA, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2014.","He is currently with the Memristive Material Team, HP Labs, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

For instance, memristor cross-point arrays can realize dense synapse network among hundreds of neuron circuits, which is not affordable for traditional implementations. However, little progress was made in synapse designs that support both static and dynamic synaptic properties. In addition, many neuron circuits require signals in specific pulse shape, limiting the scale of system implementation. Last but not least, a bottom-up study starting from realistic memristor devices is still missing in the current research of memristor-based neuromorphic systems. Here, we propose a memristor-based dynamic (MD) synapse design with experiment-calibrated memristor models. The structure obtains both static and dynamic synaptic properties by using one memristor for weight storage and the other as a selector. We overcame the device nonlinearities and demonstrated spike-timing-based recall, weight tunability, and spike-timing-based learning functions on MD synapse. Furthermore, a temporal pattern learning application was investigated to evaluate the use of MD synapses in spiking neural networks, under both spike-timing-dependent plasticity and remote supervised method learning rules.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/7982827/7723927-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7723927/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17040573","volume":"36","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Memristor-Based Dynamic Synapse for Spiking Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"DARPA","grantNumber":"D13AP00042"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1311747"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"AFRL","grantNumber":"FA8750-15-2-0048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007302","fundingName":"HP Labs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Compact Memristor-Based Dynamic Synapse for Spiking Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcad-hu-2618866-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116474S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7982827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7982827","articleId":"7723927","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7723932,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Chang Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7945302/7723932/zhong-2622402-small.gif","p":["Qing-Chang Zhong (M\u201903\u2013SM\u201904\u2013F\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree in control and power engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2004 (awarded the Best Doctoral Thesis Prize), and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2000.","He is the Max McGraw Endowed Chair Professor in energy and power engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA.","Prof. Zhong is a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Power and Energy Society, IEEE Power Electronics Society, and IEEE Control Systems Society.

The controller introduces bounded nonlinear dynamics and, by using nonlinear input-to-state stability theory, the current-limiting property of the inverter is analytically proven. The proposed controller can be operated in the set mode to accurately send the desired power to the grid or in the droop mode to take part in the grid regulation, while maintaining the inverter current below a given value at all times. Opposed to the existing current-limiting approaches, the current limitation is achieved without external limiters, additional switches, or monitoring devices and the controller remains a continuous-time system guaranteeing system stability. Furthermore, this is achieved independently from grid voltage and frequency variations, maintaining the desired control performance under grid faults as well. Extensive experimental results are presented to verify the droop function of the proposed controller and its current-limiting capability under normal and faulty grid conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7723932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"64","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"16948308","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7723932/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current-Limiting Droop Control of Grid-Connected Inverters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J01558X/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Current-Limiting Droop Control of Grid-Connected Inverters","sourcePdf":"tie-zhong-2622402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089563S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7945302","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7945302","articleId":"7723932","onlineDate":"27 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7723934,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this letter, we present a computational framework for quantifying spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) during behavior by identifying a functional plasticity rule solely from spiking activity. First, we formulate a flexible point-process spiking neuron model structure with STDP, which includes functions that characterize the stationary and plastic properties of the neuron. The STDP model includes a novel function for prolonged plasticity induction, as well as a more typical function for synaptic weight change based on the relative timing of input-output spike pairs. Consideration for system stability is incorporated with weight-dependent synaptic modification. Next, we formalize an estimation technique using a generalized multilinear model (GMLM) structure with basis function expansion. The weight-dependent synaptic modification adds a nonlinearity to the model, which is addressed with an iterative unconstrained optimization approach. Finally, we demonstrate successful model estimation on simulated spiking data and show that all model functions can be estimated accurately with this method across a variety of simulation parameters, such as number of inputs, output firing rate, input firing type, and simulation time. Since this approach requires only naturally generated spikes, it can be readily applied to behaving animal studies to characterize the underlying mechanisms of learning and memory.</para>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724008","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/7724003/07724008.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00883","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2351","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Stable Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity from Spiking Activity with Generalized Multilinear Modeling","volume":"28","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Stable Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity from Spiking Activity with Generalized Multilinear Modeling","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02266S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","isNumber":"7724003","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","articleId":"7724008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724010,"authors":[{"name":"Yuwei Cui","affiliation":["Numenta, Inc.

Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods\u2014autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks\u2014time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks\u2014long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.</para>","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00893","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/7724003/07724010.pdf","startPage":"2474","endPage":"2504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Online Sequence Learning with an Unsupervised Neural Network Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724010/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Online Sequence Learning with an Unsupervised Neural Network Model","volume":"28","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Online Sequence Learning with an Unsupervised Neural Network Model","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00893.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0196S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","isNumber":"7724003","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"32","articleId":"7724010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724042,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Fajardo Jaimes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pontifical Xavierian University, Bogota, Colombia","Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianpolis, Brazil"],"firstName":"Arturo Fajardo","lastName":"Jaimes","id":"37085766764"},{"name":"Fernando Rangel de Sousa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianpolis, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando Rangel","lastName":"de Sousa","id":"37275657400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2737-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724042","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Radio frequency","Ports (Computers)","Load modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Wireless communication","Body area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network synthesis","power convertors","radiofrequency power amplifiers","radiofrequency power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","energy power sources","EPS","nonelectromagnetic energy sources","wireless power transfer techniques","WPT techniques","energy autonomy","electric devices","DC/RF converter","energy flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-A power amplifier","class-D power amplifier","efficiency","power amplifier modeling","wireless power transfer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724042","abstract":"Recently the non-electromagnetic energy sources and wireless power transfer (WPT) techniques have been used to obtain electromagnetic (EM) energy sources for providing energy autonomy to electric devices when the energy in the environment is insufficient.

Further, in the power stage of the DC/RF converter the energy flow is processed using a power amplifier (PA). This paper proposes a design methodology for a generic PA fed by a limited power source. This methodology extracts the maximum available power of the EPS with the maximum PA efficiency using impedance matching and a novel PA modeling based on its impedance ports (DC and AC). Moreover, models of class-A PA and class-D PA were developed as examples. Furthermore, a Class-A PA was designed using its impedance ports model and the proposed methodology as a proof of concept.

Results for the approximate architecture with 10 discarded HT coefficients show energy per operation reduction of 70.7% and BD-PSNR reduction of just -0.008 dB, for a 1080p video sequence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel pruned-based algorithm for energy-efficient SATD operation in the HEVC coding","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724049","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724049.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel pruned-based algorithm for energy-efficient SATD operation in the HEVC coding","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724049/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427067","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel pruned-based algorithm for energy-efficient SATD operation in the HEVC coding","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PaperReg047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051228S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593174","isNumber":"7724036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593174","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7724036","articleId":"7724049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724056,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Anacona-Mosquera","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Brasilia, Bras\u00edlia, D.F., Brazil"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Anacona-Mosquera","id":"37085884806"},{"name":"Janier Arias-Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Janier","lastName":"Arias-Garc\u00eda","id":"38320349900"},{"name":"Daniel M.

This block is the key element of a Factorial Delay Locked Loop (F-DLL), and its balanced nature allows to significantly reduce the reference frequency-related spurious that are generated within the spectrum of a frequency generation unit when the latter is based on DLL. Once compared to the classical implementations of F-DLL logic block a Boolean routing is substituted to the switches. This allows a constant loading to the delay elements regardless the selected functionality of the logic block, namely delay line or ring oscillator. Doing so, the classical discrepancy that occurs in propagation delays in the two different modes is cancelled or at least minimized. The reference frequency-related error is therefore repealed.","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724061","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A balanced logic routing block for Factorial-DLL based Frequency Generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Ring oscillators","Frequency synthesizers","Capacitors","Radiation detectors","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay lines","delay lock loops","network routing","signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balanced logic routing block","factorial DLL based frequency generation","delay line","ring oscillator","voltage controlled element","factorial delay locked loop","Boolean routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay Locked loop","voltage controlled delay line","frequency generation","RFIC","ultra-low power lectronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A balanced logic routing block for Factorial-DLL based Frequency Generation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16427046","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7724061/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724061/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A balanced logic routing block for Factorial-DLL based Frequency Generation","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PaperReg082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051023S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593174","isNumber":"7724036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593174","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7724036","articleId":"7724061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724063,"authors":[{"name":"Mateus Melo","affiliation":["Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits (GACI), Federal University of Pelot as -

These two versions implement a parallelism-oriented algorithm and provide two performance/energy operation points allowing flexibility for dynamic power management according to runtime scenarios. The solution presented in this paper uses a scheme to reduce the number of operations required to perform the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) for the evaluated candidate blocks. This scheme is based on the accumulation of previously calculated SADs, considering the 8\u00d78 Prediction Unities (PU) as base blocks, to generate the SAD for larger PUs. The proposed solution was evaluated in two platforms, (1) an Odroid XU-3, with a Samsung Exynos 5422 SoC, featuring a 64-core Mali-T628 MP6 GPGPU, and (2) an FPGA device.

Analog-to-digital converters (ADC) represent one of the major bottleneck of CIS. One of the candidates to overcome the existing limits is the column-parallel ADC. Column-parallel extended counting ADCs (EC-ADC) are able to reach high resolution thanks to their two-step conversion. However the EC-ADC area increases due to the two-step design. A solution is to use the same hardware twice to perform both steps. This paper proposes a 14-b, 100 kHz Nyquist frequency, two-step incremental \u03a3\u0394 (I\u03a3\u0394) analog-to-digital converter suitable for column-parallel CIS. Several architectures with different modulator order are compared to determine the most promising one. The proposed architecture, compared to a one-step second order modulator, reduces the total oversampling ratio (OSR) from 150 to 60 to reach a resolution of 14-b. The operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA) is the most critical part in our ADCs. Its required DC-gain is around 80 dB for a 120 MHz gain-bandwidth product (GBW). The ideal DNL and INL of our two-step I\u03a3\u0394 ADC are respectively +0.55/-0.6 LSB and +0.5/-0.5 LSB. This work achieves a SNDR of 89 dB when a full scale sinusoid of 100 kHz is applied.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724065.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new two-step \u03a3\u0394 architecture column-parallel ADC for CMOS image sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Gain","Clocks","Computer architecture","Image resolution","CMOS image sensors","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","operational amplifiers","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-step incremental \u03a3\u0394 architecture column","CMOS image sensor","CIS","analog-to-digital converter","EC-ADC","column-parallel extended counting ADC","two-step conversion","Nyquist frequency","oversampling ratio","OSR","operational transconductance amplifier","OTA","gain-bandwidth product","GBW","DNL","INL","frequency 100 kHz","bandwidth 120 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ADC","incremental","sigma-delta (\u03a3\u0394)","two-step","CMOS Image Sensor","column-parallel ADC","second-order \u03a3\u0394"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","displayDocTitle":"A new two-step \u03a3\u0394 architecture column-parallel ADC for CMOS image sensor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724065/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427061","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new two-step \u03a3\u0394 architecture column-parallel ADC for CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PaperReg095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079641S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593174","isNumber":"7724036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593174","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7724036","articleId":"7724065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724067,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Forensic applications uses this comparison for personal identication. For instance, in the USA, the CODES system has today 14.9 million DNA proles stored on its database. To accelerate the recurrent task to query into similar databases, this work presents a hardware acclerator for the parallel alignment of multiple DNA sequences, aiming for the maximum throughput. The proposed accelerator architecture optimizes the use of hardware resources, the data access strategy and, as a result, memory bandwidth. The experiments were conducted using a DNA database with 8 million individuals, in which, each of them is represented using a set of 15 sequences with a length of 256 nucleotides. In this case study, a prototype of the proposed hardware accelerator using a single Stratix IV FPGA and running at the frequency of 250MHz outperforms by tens of times consolidated software applications like SWIPE and FASTA which are running in a GPP platform, as well as an optimized GPU implementation in OpenCL.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware accelerator for the alignment of multiple DNA sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","DNA","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","DNA","field programmable gate arrays","molecular biophysics","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware accelerator","multiple DNA sequences alignment","molecular biology","forensic applications","personal identication","parallel alignment","accelerator architecture","hardware resource optimization","data access strategy","memory bandwidth","DNA database","Stratix IV FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","displayDocTitle":"A hardware accelerator for the alignment of multiple DNA sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427055","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware accelerator for the alignment of multiple DNA sequences","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PaperReg102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098933S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593174","isNumber":"7724036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593174","xplore-issue":"7724036","articleId":"7724069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724071,"authors":[{"name":"Erika S.

Applications of the multiple match template technique range from tracking of multiple independent objects to several pose variations of a single object. Due to its high accuracy and tolerance to brightness and contrast changes, the zero mean normalized cross-correlation(ZNCC) was selected as similarity measure. This paper proposes an FPGA architecture that explores a full pipeline implementation and maximizes the internal data reuse to calculate several ZNCC-based template matching in an efficient approach. Experimental results shows that the proposed implementation achieves the real-time performance reaching up to 30fps running ten parallel ZNCCs in a single Stratix IV FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724071","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based accelerator for multiple real-time template matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based accelerator for multiple real-time template matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724071/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427034","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7724071/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based accelerator for multiple real-time template matching","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PaperReg105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063721S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593174","isNumber":"7724036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7724036","articleId":"7724071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724074,"authors":[{"name":"Fabi\u00e1n Olivera","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - EPOLI/PEE/COPPE, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fabi\u00e1n","lastName":"Olivera","id":"37598081700"},{"name":"Antonio Petraglia","affiliation":["Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - EPOLI/PEE/COPPE, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Petraglia","id":"37270882400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2737-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724074","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic boundaries for 6T-SRAM design in standby mode","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593174/7724036/07724074.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 29th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724036","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2016.7724074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage currents","Transistors","Inverters","Manufacturing processes","Simulation","Random access memory","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","leakage currents","minimisation","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["6T-SRAM design","standby mode","analytic model","supply voltage minimization","leakage current","manufacturing process variations","6T-SRAM cells","DIBL effects","drain-induced barrier lowering effects","CMOS nodes","sub-threshold region","electrical simulation","FDSOI CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DIBL","minimum-supply-voltage","SNM","ULP","ULV"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724074","abstract":"In this paper an analytic model is presented, whose purpose is to determine boundaries inside which supply voltage is minimized and leakage current is limited under manufacturing process variations for 6T-SRAM cells operating in standby mode.

Service models like SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) are standards made to provide services to general public. Cloud computing has many advantages like shared pool of resources, location independent data storage, 24/7 support, information are provided to computer users on demand etc. There are various schemes proposed such as keyword search over encryption schemes and graph query dealing with issues of privacy, confidentiality maintaining among cloud users.

Selective Mapping is PAPR reduction techniques to provide good performance without exhibiting any signal distortion. Selective Mapping method is employed and then clipping is performed to achieve further reduction in PAPR. Clipping is performed due to its own advantages such as less complex circuitry and simple computations. Simulation results of combined scheme of Selective Mapping and Clipping show that it can achieve significant PAPR reduction compared to individual methods.","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724506.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The combined scheme of selective mapping and clipping for PAPR reduction of OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The combined scheme of selective mapping and clipping for PAPR reduction of OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724506/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426322","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7724506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The combined scheme of selective mapping and clipping for PAPR reduction of OFDM","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP2922386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084695S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724509,"authors":[{"name":"Monisha Sharma","affiliation":["FET-SSGI, SSTC, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Monisha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38667526600"},{"name":"Chandrashekhar Kamargaonkar","affiliation":["Dept. of ET&T, SSTC, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Chandrashekhar","lastName":"Kamargaonkar","id":"37085872819"},{"name":"Jayant Kumar Rai","affiliation":["Dept. of ET&T, SSTC, Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Jayant Kumar","lastName":"Rai","id":"37085890818"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4421-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4420-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9417-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724509","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handheld computers","Decision support systems","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image matching","image motion analysis","image sequences","medical image processing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image sequence compression","fast block matching algorithm","SPIHT","pathology labs","digital image sequences","lossless compression","JPEG-LS","inter frame coding","compression gain","motion vector","motion compression","interface coding","adaptive rood pattern search","ARPS","set partitioning in hierarchical trees"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ARPS","DS","ES","Motion Vector","NTSS","SPIHT","4SS"]}],"abstract":"Pathology labs produce a large amount of digital image sequences. A digital image sequences are required considerably large memory. However the only solution is a lossless compression technique. In which JPEG-LS with inter frame coding is successfully achieve compression gain of 13.3 % as compared to JPEG-LS. To achieve more gain we are proposing a lossless compression method using SPIHT and motion vector. Motion vector compressed motion between the adjacent image sequences. The motion is not much dominating so we do a motion compression only, in which co-relation between Image sequences is less than the threshold. On the basis of the test image calculation, we are able to achieve 37% gain over JPEG and interface coding. Adaptive rood pattern search (ARPS) is the fastest algorithm among all other existing blocks matching techniques.","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724509.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","startPage":"1459","endPage":"1463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical image sequence compression using fast block matching algorithm and SPIHT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Medical image sequence compression using fast block matching algorithm and SPIHT","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426334","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7724509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical image sequence compression using fast block matching algorithm and SPIHT","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP295883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065398S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724522,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Antenna results are carried out on Computer simulation tool (CST) and results are analyzed in terms of return loss, isolation, antenna gain, radiation pattern and correlation coefficient. A comparative study of results has been taken into account for proposed antenna with and without ground stubs. The novel ground stubs inserted in the ground plane reduce the mutual coupling and enhance isolation from -10 dB to -18 dB for almost whole ultra wideband except the frequency range of 6.7 GHz to 9.35 GHz. A good impedance bandwidth, diversity performance makes the proposed designed antenna suitable for high-speed wireless communication system.","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724522.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB-MIMO diversity antenna for next generation wireless applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724522/","displayDocTitle":"UWB-MIMO diversity antenna for next generation wireless applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426295","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724522/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB-MIMO diversity antenna for next generation wireless applications","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3081067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048752S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724523,"authors":[{"name":"Bhawna Ahuja","affiliation":["Galgotia College of Engineering and Technology, Greater, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Bhawna","lastName":"Ahuja","id":"38232115400"},{"name":"Gurjit Kaur","affiliation":["Gautam Buddha University, Greater, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Gurjit","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37085715176"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4421-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4420-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9417-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724523","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN channels","Rayleigh channels","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy logic","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","cognitive radio systems","fuzzy logic detector","power spectral density","PSD","received signal","cyclostationary based detection","primary user signal","multiple energy detectors","MED","ADT based detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum sensing","Two Stage detector","Fuzzy logic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel two stage improved spectrum sensing for cognitive radio systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","endPage":"1538","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724523.pdf","startPage":"1533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724523","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel two stage detector for spectrum sensing using fuzzy logic. The first stage consists of classical Energy detector which is preferred approach because of its simplicity. However its performance decreases at low SNR. Hence, second stage consisting of Fuzzy logic Detectoris invoked, if detection is failed by first stage. Implementation of Fuzzy logic helps in taking rational decision in uncertain conditions and improves the performance and accuracy. Fuzzy logic detector takes decision based on two new parameters which are calculated from estimated energy and estimated PSD of received signal. Numerical results show that proposed scheme improves performance by 20% at -9 dB when compared with two stage sensing using ED and cyclostationary based detection. Moreover, applicability of proposed scheme is independent of format or structure detection of Primary user signal whereas priori information about primary user signal is required for cyclostatonary based detection. Proposed scheme also gives comparable performance with MED and ADT based detector where multiple energy detectors were used at first stage. Thus our scheme gives the benefit of low complexity and cost since single and simple classical Energy detector is used a first stage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16426714","htmlLink":"/document/7724523/","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel two stage improved spectrum sensing for cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel two stage improved spectrum sensing for cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP3091115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097736S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724524,"authors":[{"name":"Avantika Bhati","affiliation":["Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Avantika","lastName":"Bhati","id":"37085905871"},{"name":"Bhawna Ahuja","affiliation":["Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology, Greater Noida, India"],"firstName":"Bhawna","lastName":"Ahuja","id":"38232115400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4421-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4420-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9417-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724524","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Detectors","Interference","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","throughput analysis","energy detection","spectrum sensing","wireless digital communication services","spectrum scarcity","licensed bands","unlicensed users","licensed service providers","collision occurrence","interference occurrence","single user sensing","cooperative detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radios","Cooperative spectrum sensing","Energy detector","Throughput","Probability of false alarm","Probability of detection","Spectrum sensing techniques"]}],"abstract":"The wide proliferation of wireless digital communication services and spectrum scarcity has led to the development of cognitive radio. They can tackle both scarcity as well as growing demand. For efficient utilization of the spectrum, it permits unlicensed users to exploit licensed bands when they are idle. Since licensees are preferred, so the unlicensed users regularly observe the band of licensed service providers to prevent the occurrence of collisions (interference). This is known as spectrum sensing. It is one of the essential jobs carried out by cognitive radios which assist in their implementation. To conquer the issues of single user sensing, cooperative detection algorithm is used.

Thus, secure data sharing, storage and transference for this large volume of the data set are one of the key issues for cloud computing. Since the transfer of information on the internet or in any other network scheme is vulnerable to an attack by the hacker hence to deal with such kind of problems, cryptography algorithms are used. Cryptography algorithms provide a secure atmosphere in which data transference from a user point of view can easily achieve confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability and identification.

The data's like image and video were also transmitted in the form of signal. Because of limited channel bandwidth the data has to be compressed but due to which the quality of the image was reduced. Wavelet transform has been used widely in the signal processing. DWT has been developed as a compression technique which provides better compression ratio. Here a CDF 5/3 DWT compression technique is used for the compression of video which has better compression ratio without the loss of quality of the video. The video has been rDeconstructed using the IDWT technique. The PSNR and MSE are also measured here. The video compression is implemented using MATLAB Simulink and simulation results are seen using Cadence/Xilinx.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Low power VLSI implementation of data compression for multimedia devices using CDF m/n DWT on to resource constrained dynamically reconfigurable memories","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724715.pdf","startPage":"2518","endPage":"2523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Low power VLSI implementation of data compression for multimedia devices using CDF m/n DWT on to resource constrained dynamically reconfigurable memories","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426384","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Low power VLSI implementation of data compression for multimedia devices using CDF m/n DWT on to resource constrained dynamically reconfigurable memories","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP501946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026274S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","articleId":"7724715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724741,"authors":[{"name":"Anjana Gosain","affiliation":["USICT, GGSIP University Dwarka, New Delhi, INDIA"],"firstName":"Anjana","lastName":"Gosain","id":"37664512600"},{"name":"Anju Saha","affiliation":["USICT, GGSIP University Dwarka, New Delhi, INDIA"],"firstName":"Anju","lastName":"Saha","id":"37086072573"},{"name":"Deepika Singh","affiliation":["USICT, GGSIP University Dwarka, New Delhi, INDIA"],"firstName":"Deepika","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085902827"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4421-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4420-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9417-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724741","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Noise measurement","Conferences","Cancer","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based classification","class imbalancing","classifiers","knowledge discovery process","heuristic based sampling algorithms","imbalanced datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["binary-class imbalance problem","classification","multi class imbalance problem","classifiers","supervised learning","undersampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724741","abstract":"Classifiers are built for analysis through the Knowledge Discovery Process.

The robot is built in such a way that it can be controlled both using manual keys of a laptop and an android application from which the commands will be transferred to the robots chassis using the Bluetooth communication module. The same will be functional using speech commands that will be passed onto the robot using the same procedure. The robot will also behave like a maze following bot and will continue to maneuver itself in a domain or an area that is filled with obstacles without collision into any of them. The obstacle avoidance or the maze following will be implemented using the Infrared Sensors. Finally a line following module is implemented along with the maze following module by integrating Charge Transfer Infrared sensors which is further combined with the path finding PointBug algorithm in order to fine the optimal path from the source to the target by colliding with the obstacles and finding the minimum distance from the source to the target each time it meets with a collision with any of the obstacles. In addition to it the robot can also be controlled using the accelerometer functionalities. The entire project is developed in such a way that it is capable of traversing to the target location by avoiding all types of obstacles and moving on an optimized path and leading to significant results both with respect to time and energy and thereby implementing the latest technology in order to make the system to be controlled using Android, Bluetooth, speech and path finding algorithms to introduce intelligence into the control system to make suitable decisions at a particular instance of time so that the user is capable of reaching the target location without any type of interference or assistance from additional aids.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724778.pdf","startPage":"2815","endPage":"2820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human robot interaction using Android and PointBug algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Human robot interaction using Android and PointBug algorithm","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724778/","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426148","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human robot interaction using Android and PointBug algorithm","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP5642216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103363S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7724792,"authors":[{"name":"Sagar Verma","affiliation":["ITM University, Gwalior, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Sagar","lastName":"Verma","id":"37085886189"},{"name":"Aran Kumar Yadav","affiliation":["ITM University, Gwalior, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Aran Kumar","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37085810225"},{"name":"Deepak Motwani","affiliation":["ITM University, Gwalior, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Motwani","id":"37085385014"},{"name":"R.S.

The maximal uniform distribution of the load across closer and more number of simpler nodes can help managing and providing the big data and large workloads more easily. The paper proposes an efficient load balancing algorithm for a Fog-Cloud based architecture. The algorithm uses data replication technique for maintaining data in Fog networks which reduces overall dependency on big data centers. A comparison of present load balancing techniques in `Cloud-based' infrastructure to the presented `Cloud-Fog' duo is also shown.

Technique used to find the presence of primary user (PU) is energy detection technique and here we compare the output of energy detector with a threshold which then depends on noise floor and signal is detected. Here we use power spectral density, which describes how the power of a signal is distributed over different frequencies. We make use of MATLAB software to detect the user's power spectral density (PSD) of received signal at different SNR values. The receiver is used to distinguish the empty slots for use of secondary users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724816/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16426518","publicationDate":"March 2016","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724816/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio spectrum sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio spectrum sensing","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP6021586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100894S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724835,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is useful for all, from small computer users to large enterprises. In traditional computer system, data are stored in local servers which have lower capacity and lower CPU performances. Cloud services are based on datacenter which provides resources on demand with higher capacity, lowest response time and improved resource utilization. Each datacenter has many servers and virtual servers with different loads. Load balancing avoids resource overload and divides the traffic within servers. Load balancing is the main challenge in cloud computing, as it requires distributing the load between many nodes, while taking care that any of the nodes is neither overloaded nor under loaded. This paper provides algorithm for balancing load in cloud. The load can be of Memory, CPU or Network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07724910.pdf","startPage":"3471","endPage":"3475","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7724910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance, energy and storage efficient dynamic load balancing algorithm in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handheld computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance-energy-storage efficient-dynamic load balancing algorithm","cloud computing","data storage","local servers","cloud services","datacenter","resource capacity","response time","resource utilization","virtual servers","load distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Load balancing","Virtual Machine","Host","Resource Allocation","Energy Consumption","Cost","Resource Utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7724910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distance, energy and storage efficient dynamic load balancing algorithm in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7724910/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426406","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance, energy and storage efficient dynamic load balancing algorithm in cloud computing","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP6961949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05593S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7724910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7724912,"authors":[{"name":"N Rashmi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, BMS Institute of Technology and Management, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"N","lastName":"Rashmi"},{"name":"Mrinal Sarvagya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Reva University, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Mrinal","lastName":"Sarvagya"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4421-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-9-3805-4420-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9417-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7724912","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Mathematical model","Kalman filters","Modulation","Wireless communication","Computational modeling","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","channel estimation","Kalman filters","modulation coding","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","extended Kalman filter","superposition coded modulation system","SCM scheme","EKF","time varying Rayleigh fast fading channel environment","Jakes process","autoregressive model","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCM (Superposition Coded Modulation)","EKF(Extended Kalman Filter)","AR model (Auto regressive)model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)is implemented with the Superposition Coded Modulation(SCM) scheme.

Thus, predicting the reliability of software before its release acts as a deciding factor to estimate whether a vendor must produce it or not. As the analytical models rely on the assumptions which are considered before project starts, making a unique assumptions each time is quite a difficult task, hence this paper, resolves the problem of assumptions. The main concern is to develop general prediction models. For achieving the goal, failure history from similar projects is collected and then is applied to construct various neural network models for prediction. The proposed methodology simply shows how different data sets can be applied to the NN models and finds the optimal among them.","startPage":"4072","endPage":"4077","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589474/7724213/07725024.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7724213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating neural networks with software reliability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feeds","Training","Biological neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Correlation","Predictive models","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","software reliability","general prediction models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Reliability","Parametric Model","Non-Parametric Model","Neural Network","Feed Forward Neural network","Elman network","Cascade Correlation Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2016","displayDocTitle":"Integrating neural networks with software reliability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2016","accessionNumber":"16426625","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating neural networks with software reliability","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"RP8102600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079678S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589474","isNumber":"7724213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589474","xplore-issue":"7724213","articleId":"7725024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi as the Organizer of INDIACom - 2016","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7725259,"authors":[{"name":"Dickon Ross","firstName":"Dickon","lastName":"Ross"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1750-9637"}],"articleNumber":"7725259","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":581},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Institution of Engineering and Technology","url":"http://www.theiet.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725259","doi":"10.1049/et.2016.0403","endPage":"45","startPage":"44","publicationTitle":"Engineering & Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/10908/7725239/07725259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/et.2016.0403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital twinning [Information Technology Virtual Reality]","abstract":"DO YOU HAVE an avatar?

Cognitive Radio has suggested better spectrum utility nowadays. The primary user, in cognitive radio, is the licensed user of the spectrum. When primary user is not using the spectrum, the spectrum is free which can be accessed by the secondary user. This sharing of spectrum can be controlled by Cognitive Radio technology. In this paper, we introduce new sensing methods based on Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of signals received at secondary users. There are two sensing algorithm options are existing based on Eigenvalue method, one is Maximum to Minimum Eigenvalue and second is Average Energy to Minimum Eigenvalue. For the analysis, we considered the Maximum to Minimum Eigenvalue based method. We propose Block Wise Eigenvalue based spectrum sensing algorithm with the aim of improving accuracy, speed and reduced computational complexity of sensing compared to existing techniques. The proposed method gives better performance than the ideal Eigenvalue based spectrum sensing when the signals are highly correlated. Simulations based on the randomly generated signal are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16426038","htmlLink":"/document/7725303/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Block-wise Eigenvalue Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithm in Cognitive Radio Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-wise Eigenvalue Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithm in Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"8323a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068737S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7574982","isNumber":"7725280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7574982","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7725280","articleId":"7725303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725304,"authors":[{"name":"Attiq Ahmed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Attiq","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37288874700"},{"name":"Hasnat Khurshid","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hasnat","lastName":"Khurshid","id":"37085480254"},{"name":"Muhammad Mohsin Riaz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Center of Advanced Studies Technology, COMSATS, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Mohsin","lastName":"Riaz","id":"38247041600"},{"name":"Abdul Ghafoor","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Ghafoor","id":"37287131200"},{"name":"Tahir Zaidi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Tahir","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37403304300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8323-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8324-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"7725304","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725304","abstract":"Image fusion merges the complementary information of different sensors and wavelengths.

The various features of an image are color, texture, shape or domain specific features. Texture is considered as one of the main feature of any image. The second order statistical features for an image is obtained by Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and it operates on spatial domain. The haralick texture features are energy, entropy, homogeneity, correlation, contrast, dissimilarity and maximum probability. The aim of the paper is to classify the dermoscopy images into melanoma and non-melanoma by considering the texture and color features of an image. GLCM is used to extract the texture features of an image. Color histograms are used to extract the color features in three color spaces namely RGB, HSV and OPP. Support vector machine (SVM) is used for the process of classification. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by the metrics sensitivity and specificity. The experimental result shows that the texture combined with RGB color space provides better classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICCTIDE.2016.7725347","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computing Technologies and Intelligent Data Engineering (ICCTIDE'16)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Computing Technologies and Intelligent Data Engineering (ICCTIDE'16)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589933/7725321/07725347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTIDE.2016.7725347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725321","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture and color feature extraction for classification of melanoma using SVM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Texture and color feature extraction for classification of melanoma using SVM","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16426930","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7725347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture and color feature extraction for classification of melanoma using SVM","confLoc":"Kovilpatti, India","sourcePdf":"32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071819S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589933","isNumber":"7725321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589933","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7725321","articleId":"7725347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725361,"authors":[{"name":"J Priya","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, SRIT, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Priya","id":"37085618984"},{"name":"S Pravinthraja","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, SRIT, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Pravinthraja","id":"37085892967"},{"name":"K.

However, high communication overhead and energy costs for exchanging sensing results may limit its viability in a realistic large scale resource constraint network such as cognitive radio wireless sensor networks. This paper presents a Weighted Hard Combination (WHC) scheme that combines features of both quantized and hard combining schemes to minimize energy cost for reporting sensing result and improve primary user detection performance in cooperative sensing. We evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme through simulation. Performance comparison of the WHC scheme in terms of detection performance, reporting energy cost and reporting time ratio with conventional hard combination, soft combination and quantized schemes indicates viability of the scheme. The results indicate that the WHC scheme minimizes reporting energy cost by 70% and improves detection performance by 5.6% compared to the quantized 3-bits scheme.","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725399","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725399.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725399","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A weighted hard combination scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A weighted hard combination scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725399/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16426897","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A weighted hard combination scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093836S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725404,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Babu Battula","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur"],"firstName":"Ramesh Babu","lastName":"Battula","id":"37085371566"},{"name":"Manoj Singh Gaur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur"],"firstName":"Manoj Singh","lastName":"Gaur","id":"37408491700"},{"name":"Dinesh Gopalani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Gopalani","id":"37402646500"},{"name":"Meenakshi Tripathi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur"],"firstName":"Meenakshi","lastName":"Tripathi","id":"37085515237"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0019-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0018-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0020-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725404","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Routing","Delays","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum aware distance utilization routing protocol","spectrum scarcity","dynamic spectrum access","DSA","CR technology","multihope cognitive radio networks","end-to-end delivery","CRN","optimal routing paths","link utilization factor","spectrum availability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725404","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725404","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","abstract":"The increasing demand of wireless applications has led to the problem of spectrum scarcity. The new networking paradigm is widely known as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). DSA can be realized by use of cognitive radio (CR) technology. A CR provides an opportunistic utilization of an underutilized spectrum to the node with which it is equipped. Usually a nonlicensed user/node is equipped with a CR. Recent research has mainly been focused on Spectrum sensing, sharing, mobility and decision making which allows one to make use available free spectrum blocks opportunistically, but less emphasis have been laid on routing in multi-hope cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The feasibility of a multi-hope CRN depends entirely on routing scheme employed in it, as it ensures end-to-end delivery of data packets. Hence to make CRNs more efficient and prominent, an effective routing layer is required which is aware of the dynamics of CRNs. This work proposes a Spectrum Aware Distance Utilization Routing Protocol for (CRNs). The proposed protocol aims at providing optimal routing paths, which offers high spectrum availability with minimum path length between any pair of Source and Destination, hence enhancing routing in multi-hop CRNs. For optimal path formulation, it uses spectrum availability and link utilization factor. Through extensive simulations the efficiency of the proposed protocol found better than the existing ones.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725404.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum aware distance utilization routing protocol for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7725404/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum aware distance utilization routing protocol for cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16426881","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum aware distance utilization routing protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045922S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725407,"authors":[{"name":"Deepa Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Deepa","lastName":"Das","id":"37085494569"},{"name":"Susmita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Das","id":"37404265900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0019-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0018-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0020-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725407","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Sensors","Cascading style sheets","Standards","Evolutionary computation","Convergence","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","particle swarm optimisation","probability","radio spectrum management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing scheme","hybrid IWOPSO algorithm","cognitive radio networks","spectrum scarcity","under-utilized frequency band detection","improved soft decision fusion","CSS scheme","hybrid invasive weed optimization-and-particle swarm optimization algorithm","global optimization method","weight coefficient optimization","detection probability maximization","primary user emulation attack","PUEA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","soft decision fusion","hybrid IWOPSO","PUEA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725407","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725407.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing using hybrid IWOPSO algorithm in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is an emerging technology to combat the spectrum scarcity issues.

The detection accuracy of a cognitive radio network (CRN) improves through using a cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme. However, increasing the number of SU necessitates a growth in the cooperation overhead of the system leading to degradation the throughput of the CRN. Multi stage-cross entropy (MSCE) optimization algorithm has been proposed to optimize the trade-off between global probability of detection at fusion center (FC) and achievable throughput in cooperative CRNs, and then compared the results with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The proposed approach is based on cross entropy (CE) optimization method. A bi-objective (BO) function have been formulated for static PU signal state scenarios. Numerical results show that the MSCE performance is superior in terms of achievable PU detection rate when compared with GA, PSO and hard decision combining (HDC) rules. Additionally, the BO-MSCE optimization system based-HDC rules achieve a best fitness score higher than that of the GA and PSO for the OR, AND, and Majority rules, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16426919","htmlLink":"/document/7725418/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-stage cross entropy optimization algorithm for hard combining schemes in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stage cross entropy optimization algorithm for hard combining schemes in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06552S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725419,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Outage probability is used to represent the performance parameter for two different cases. In the first case, relay is able to forward the information from source to destination. In the second case, it is assumed the relay suffers an outage and could not decode the information from the source. We consider total probability law in two cases.

We later analyze the effect of modulation order, number of subcarriers, signal scaling and biasing operation on the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which is a major issue in OFDM based VLC system. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) decreases as the degree of nonlinearity increases and a better BER can be achieved as the LED behavior approaches linear model. In addition, it is shown that reducing the QAM order or increasing the number of subcarriers may reduce the effect of the LED nonlinearity, thus improving the BER performance of the VLC system. Moreover, it is demonstrated that PAPR is higher for a large number of subcarriers and modulation order. Finally, the PAPR of the visible light OFDM system can significantly be reduced by employing the signal scaling combined with biasing operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725427.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of DCO-OFDM in VLC system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Peak to average power ratio","Optical distortion","Optical receivers","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","free-space optical communication","indoor communication","light emitting diodes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCO-OFDM","VLC","indoor visible light communication","direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","light emitting diode","LED","peak to average power ratio","bit error rate","BER","QAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLC","Optical OFDM","PAPR","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of DCO-OFDM in VLC system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16426864","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of DCO-OFDM in VLC system","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028709S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7725427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725439,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the Massive-MIMO system the number of transmit antennas is much larger than the number of served users. Hence, it promises higher spectral efficiency by improving the rank of the overall channel matrix and localizing the interference. To mitigate interference (especially between adjacent sub-sectors), the accuracy of estimated channel is highly important. While, channel estimation in Massive-MIMO systems will cause the technical challenge of pilot contamination, due to the large number of antennas. In this regard, this paper addresses the effect of pilot training during channel estimation in downlink and uplink transmission of TDD Massive-MIMO system. The results present the performance of channel estimation in term of mean square error under different channel estimation techniques, various number of transmit antennas, and different length of pilot training. Moreover, results are compared under two different scenarios; without and with interference (pilot contamination). The results highlight the importance of pilot contamination avoidance in the Massive-MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications

frequency reuse factor of one and improves the spectral efficiency of cell-edge users. JP has a huge impact on both feedback and backhaul load, and thus partial JP was presented to tackle with signaling demand. However, achieving equivalent backhaul reduction based on limited feedback channel state information is challenging when linear techniques, such as zero-forcing beamforming (BF) are used, which led to the use of stochastic algorithms instead. Therefore stochastic multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSOA) is proposed in this paper to achieve backhaul reduction and address the issue of lack of diversity, which is related to the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSOA). The lack of diversity has been solved in this work by replacing the inactive particles adaptively based on a predefined constant which represents the difference between local best and global best optimization criterion. The performance of the proposed MSPSOA and BPSOA BF is evaluated with respect to full and partial JP using different metrics such as sum-rate, actual interference and convergence using a multipath realistic environment WINNER II channel model. The proposed MSPSOA outperforms BPSOA in terms of average sum-rate by 15.3%, while the actual interference decreased by 14.6% in some conducted scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725449","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725449.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On spectral efficiency maximization in a partial joint processing system using a multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725449/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On spectral efficiency maximization in a partial joint processing system using a multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725449/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16426922","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On spectral efficiency maximization in a partial joint processing system using a multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074902S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725450,"authors":[{"name":"Olalekan Bello","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Malaysia, Sarawak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Olalekan","lastName":"Bello","id":"37085893083"},{"name":"Hushari Zen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Malaysia, Sarawak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hushari","lastName":"Zen","id":"37547727000"},{"name":"Al-Khalid Othman","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Malaysia, Sarawak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Al-Khalid","lastName":"Othman","id":"37542914800"},{"name":"Khairuddin Abd Hamid","affiliation":["University Malaysia of Computer Science and Engineering, Putrajaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Khairuddin Abd","lastName":"Hamid","id":"37085893130"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0019-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0018-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0020-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725450","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725450","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Protocols","Conferences","Benchmark testing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward relaying","capacity improvement","error rate improvement","destination terminal","variable gain amplify-and-forward protocol","gain normalization factor","backward channel coefficient","k-normalized variable gain","kVG","decode-and-forward protocol","BER reduction","performance gap reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["amplify-and-forward","amplification factor","BER","SNR"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a variable gain amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol with a gain normalization factor which varies with the backward channel coefficient.

Furthermore, it can provide even a more attractive and practical solution, since AF relaying generally offers simpler implementation compared to DF.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725450","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725450.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-forward relaying to improve capacity and error rate at destination terminal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-forward relaying to improve capacity and error rate at destination terminal","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7725450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16426896","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-forward relaying to improve capacity and error rate at destination terminal","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053066S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725451,"authors":[{"name":"Aiman Ibrahim","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia","Wireless Innovation, MIMOS Berhad, Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Aiman","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37085886579"},{"name":"Sharul Kamal Abdul Rahim","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia","Wireless Innovation, MIMOS Berhad, Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sharul Kamal Abdul","lastName":"Rahim","id":"37410773700"},{"name":"Hafizal Mohamad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia","Wireless Innovation, MIMOS Berhad, Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hafizal","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37532339700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0019-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0018-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0020-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Biological neural networks","Mathematical model","Wireless sensor networks","Artificial neural networks","Wireless communication","Shadow mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","mean square error methods","neural nets","radiowave propagation","RSSI","sensor placement","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSS-based WSN indoor localization scheme","wireless sensor networks","artificial neural network schemes","performance evaluation","received signal strength","target mobile nodes","severe propagation behaviors","adaptive processing","nonlinear indoor signal propagation","Elman backpropagation","cascade-forward backpropagation","feedforward backpropagation","root mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor localization","Received Signal Strength","Artificial Neural Networks","Root Mean Square Error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725451","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725451","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","abstract":"A popular way of achieving WSN localization is through measurements and evaluation of Received Signal Strength (RSS) values of the signal transmitted by target mobile nodes.

This technique consists of two inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) blocks. The input symbols of the first IFFT are the mapped symbols, whereas the input symbols of the second IFFT are the summations of the absolute value of the real part of the outer signal constellation points and zeros symbols. First, the output of the two IFFT blocks is partitioned into four subblocks, which are subsequently used to rearrange the subblocks with padding zeros in a specific manner. Then, a new optimization scheme is introduced, in which only a single two-phase sequence and four iterations needs to be applied. Numerical analysis shows that the hybrid proposed technique achieves better bit error rate (BER) and PAPR reduction performance than partial transmit sequences (PTS) multiplicative technique and tone reservation (TR) additive PAPR technique. The other salient feature of this scheme is that no side information (SI) is needed which increases transmission efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/MICC.2015.7725460","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 12th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589835/7725393/07725460.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICC.2015.7725460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725393","startPage":"345","endPage":"350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel low complexity high efficiency hybrid PAPR reduction for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel low complexity high efficiency hybrid PAPR reduction for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725460/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16426906","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7725460/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel low complexity high efficiency hybrid PAPR reduction for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"micc201564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048104S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7589835","isNumber":"7725393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589835","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7725393","articleId":"7725460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725489,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7725489/wang-2622858-small.gif","p":["Chong Wang (S\u201915) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Hohai University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2016.","Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Researcher with the University of Hong Kong.

This paper proposes a proactive operation strategy to enhance system resilience during an unfolding extreme event. The uncertain sequential transition of system states driven by the evolution of extreme events is modeled as a Markov process. At each decision epoch, the system topology is used to construct a Markov state. Transition probabilities are evaluated according to failure rates caused by extreme events. For each state, a recursive value function, including a current cost and a future cost, is established with operation constraints and intertemporal constraints. An optimal strategy is established by optimizing the recursive model, which is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming by using the linear scalarization method, with the probability of each state as the weight of each objective. The IEEE 30-bus system, the IEEE 118-bus system, and a realistic provincial power grid are used to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed proactive operation strategies can reduce the loss of load due to the development of extreme events.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2622858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07725489.pdf","startPage":"2847","endPage":"2857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2622858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resilience Enhancement With Sequentially Proactive Operation Strategies","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7725489/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969900","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725489/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677160"},{"fundingName":"Theme-based Research Scheme through Project","grantNumber":"T23-701/14-N"},{"fundingName":"Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SRA","grantNumber":"ECS739713 and GRF17202714"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Program-Shenzhen Fund","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150629151046877"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005311","fundingName":"China Southern Power Grid","grantNumber":"ZD2014-2-0004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilience Enhancement With Sequentially Proactive Operation Strategies","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-hou-2622858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08913S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7725489","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7725494,"authors":[{"name":"Huang-Chang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7835743/7725494/lee-2612655-small.gif","p":["Huang-Chang Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Chi Nan University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2014.","From 2005 to 2009, he was a Circuit Designerwith an IC design service company.

This paper presents three techniques that can be used to implement an efficient reordered layered decoder. First, with the assistance of a graph coloring method, the required minimum number of V2C sign memory banks can be theoretically determined, with the corresponding pipeline architecture also designed. After that, the integer linear programming technique is adopted so as to arrange the V2C sign memory banks in a manner that minimizes the number of pipeline stalls, thereby increasing throughput. In order to further simplify the decoder, the first minimum values are not stored if the proposed modified min-sum algorithm is used. The proposed techniques are demonstrated by implementing a rate-0.905 (18396,16644) QC-LDPC decoder using 90-nm CMOS technology. When using the proposed techniques, implementation results show that the throughput-to-area ratio (TAR) increases by 58.9% without sacrificing error-rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2612655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2612655","startPage":"457","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7835743/07725494.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization Techniques for the Efficient Implementation of High-Rate Layered QC-LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimization Techniques for the Efficient Implementation of High-Rate Layered QC-LDPC Decoders","volume":"64","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16637917","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725494/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of the R.O.C.","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2622-E-007-029-CC2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization Techniques for the Efficient Implementation of High-Rate Layered QC-LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ueng-2612655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140002S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7835743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7835743","articleId":"7725494","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725496,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbo Zhang","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085895764"},{"name":"Fan Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"38062884800"},{"name":"Jianping Li","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Li","id":"38468417500"},{"name":"Yuanhua Feng","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuanhua","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085776400"},{"name":"Zhaohui Li","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications, Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279076600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7725496","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Experimental setup for DD-OFDM-VMMDM based optical transmission.

The vector mode conversion is achieved by the key q-plate and the mode crosstalk between the converted two vector modes are both less than -20 dB. This crosstalk can be further minimized by high-quality q-plate. In this demonstration, error-free transmission has been realized with the power penalties less than 2 dB.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve this goal by learning discriminatively a hierarchy of representations of increasing abstraction. In this paper, we present a CNN-based system relying on a downsample-then-upsample architecture. Specifically, it first learns a rough spatial map of high-level representations by means of convolutions and then learns to upsample them back to the original resolution by deconvolutions. By doing so, the CNN learns to densely label every pixel at the original resolution of the image. This results in many advantages, including: 1) the state-of-the-art numerical accuracy; 2) the improved geometric accuracy of predictions; and 3) high efficiency at inference time. We test the proposed system on the Vaihingen and Potsdam subdecimeter resolution data sets, involving the semantic labeling of aerial images of 9- and 5-cm resolution, respectively. These data sets are composed by many large and fully annotated tiles, allowing an unbiased evaluation of models making use of spatial information. We do so by comparing two standard CNN architectures with the proposed one: standard patch classification, prediction of local label patches by employing only convolutions, and full patch labeling by employing deconvolutions. All the systems compare favorably or outperform a state-of-the-art baseline relying on superpixels and powerful appearance descriptors. The proposed full patch labeling CNN outperforms these models by a large margin, also showing a very appealing inference time.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7801970/07725499.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dense Semantic Labeling of Subdecimeter Resolution Images With Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Dense Semantic Labeling of Subdecimeter Resolution Images With Convolutional Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725499/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16596841","htmlLink":"/document/7725499/","volume":"55","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation through the Multimodal Machine Learning for Remote Sensing Information Fusion","grantNumber":"150593"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dense Semantic Labeling of Subdecimeter Resolution Images With Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tgrs-volpi-2616585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104771S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7801970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"7801970","articleId":"7725499","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7725503,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7725503/chen-2614993-small.gif","p":["Yen-Hao Chen received the B.S. degree in computer science and engineering from Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in computer science from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinshu, Taiwan, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science.","His current research interests include physical design automation and computer architecture."]},"firstName":"Yen-Hao","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-5456-8393","id":"37085769324"},{"name":"Yi-Lun Tang","affiliation":["Novatek, Hsinchu","Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7725503/tang-2614993-small.gif","p":["Yi-Lun Tang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2013 and 2015, respectively.","He is currently with Novatek, Hsinchu.

Moreover, the results indicate that our proposed method surprisingly not only incurs no performance and energy overheads but also achieves on average a 2.10% performance improvement and a 6.66% energy reduction compared with conventional DVFS methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"25","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16691049","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725503/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Cache-Utilization-Based Dynamic Voltage-Frequency Scaling Mechanism for Reliability Enhancements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Cache-Utilization-Based Dynamic Voltage-Frequency Scaling Mechanism for Reliability Enhancements","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chen-2614993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106139S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7862316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7862316","articleId":"7725503","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725511,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Velling Dueholm","affiliation":["Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Visual Analysis of People Lab, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274857/7769266/7725511/dueho-2622921-small.gif","p":["Jacob Velling Dueholm received the B.Sc. degree in electronic\n engineering with specialization in signal processing from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2014.

Traffic scenes are complex and vital information could be lost in unobserved regions. This paper proposes a framework that uses four visual sensors for a full surround view of a vehicle in order to achieve an understanding of surrounding vehicle behaviors. The framework will assist the analysis of naturalistic driving studies by automating the task of data reduction of the observed trajectories. To this end, trajectories are estimated using a vehicle detector together with a multiperspective optimized tracker in each view. The trajectories are transformed to a common ground plane, where they are associated between perspectives and analyzed to reveal tendencies around the ego-vehicle. The system is tested on sequences from 2.5 h of drive on US highways. The multiperspective tracker is tested in each view as well as for the ability to associate vehicles bet-ween views with a 92% recall score. A case study of vehicles approaching from the rear shows certain patterns in behavior that could potentially influence the ego-vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/TIV.2016.2622921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274857/7769266/07725511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2016.2622921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769266","startPage":"203","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectories and Maneuvers of Surrounding Vehicles With Panoramic Camera Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trajectories and Maneuvers of Surrounding Vehicles With Panoramic Camera Arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16521172","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725511/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CA DiMi Program"},{"fundingName":"Toyota CSRC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectories and Maneuvers of Surrounding Vehicles With Panoramic Camera Arrays","sourcePdf":"tiv-kristoffersen-2622921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158276S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7274857","isNumber":"7769266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274857","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7769266","articleId":"7725511","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725521,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Chin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7725521/lin-2622723-small.gif","p":["Jia-Chin Lin (S'95\u2013M'98\u2013SM'03) received\n the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998.","He was in the obligatory military service from July 1998 to March 2000 and then joined the Microelectronics and\n Information Systems Research Center, NCTU, as a Research Assistant Professor.

The achievable diversity gain relies on the channel-state information (CSI) that can be acquired at the destination because spatial diversity combining unavoidably requires the disintegrated channel information. To reduce signaling overhead, quantization and compression are applied prior to the delivery of the source-to-relay (SR) CSI to the destination. This paper studies an amplify-and-forward relay network while considering the impact of the quantization of the SR CSI. Several quantization methods relying on the statistics of the SR CSI are investigated. The probability density functions of upper and lower bounds on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the corresponding symbol-error rate (SER) achieved at the destination are derived analytically. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the simulation results with the analytical results of the SER bounds and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel quantizer. A combined method of determining the quantization interval based on equal-probability partitioning and determining the representative quanta based on the minimum-mean-square-error criterion is proposed and is verified to have the lowest quantization error among the noniterative quantization methods compared here. It is shown via the simulations that when using an iterative procedure based on the Lloyd-Max procedure, three bits per dimension are sufficient to achieve negligible SNR degradation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Interference","Spatial

It controls the grid current by energizing two coupled inductors individually during positive and negative half-grid cycles. This obviates the possibility of reverse recovery loss in switches due to their body diodes. Furthermore, two external silicon carbide diodes of a clamping branch cause negligible reverse recovery loss in switches besides a constant common-mode voltage. Therefore, the main claims of NIIFBC are low leakage current, high EU efficiency, and reliability. A generalized leakage current model for the proposed inverter is developed. In order to validate the veracity of the model and the claims of NIIFBC, a 1-kW prototype is designed and developed. The experimental results of NIIFBC validate the claims made by the authors. Its performance comparison with the existing nonisolated full-bridge inverters is given. Furthermore, a variant circuit of NIIFBC operating at nonunity power factor is proposed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Leakage currents","Capacitors","MOSFET","Inductors","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","leakage currents","MOSFET","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","power inductors","power system reliability","semiconductor diodes","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonisolated grid-tied photovoltaic system","neutral point clamped MOSFET inverter","full-bridge configuration","nonisolated full-bridge inverters","single-phase grid-tied photovoltaic system","European Union","NPC superjunction MOSFET nonisolated inverter","grid-tied PV system reliability","coupled inductors","positive half-grid cycles","negative half-grid cycles","silicon carbide diodes","constant common-mode voltage","leakage current","nonunity power factor","power 1 kW","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode voltage (CMV)","grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system","leakage current","nonisolated inverter","superjunction MOSFET"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2622711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7837735/07725524.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7837735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2622711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neutral Point Clamped MOSFET Inverter With Full-Bridge Configuration for Nonisolated Grid-Tied Photovoltaic System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neutral Point Clamped MOSFET Inverter With Full-Bridge Configuration for Nonisolated Grid-Tied Photovoltaic System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725524/","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725524/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16638893","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Deparment of Science and Technology India","grantNumber":"SR/RC-UK/Solar-2(A)2010 dtd 16/03/2011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neutral Point Clamped MOSFET Inverter With Full-Bridge Configuration for Nonisolated Grid-Tied Photovoltaic System","sourcePdf":"jestpe-chakravartula-2622711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08872S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7837735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7837735","articleId":"7725524","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7725525,"authors":[{"name":"David Cavalheiro","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7725525/caval-2617203-small.gif","p":["David Cavalheiro received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the New University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal, in 2012.

Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) show increasingly heterogeneous, cyber-physical, cooperative, and service-oriented features and are beginning to be merged with the emerging cyber-physical-social systems. Given this new trend, how to make these intelligent vehicles cooperate more safely and efficiently with one another according to novel constraints, such as mission type and quality-of-service (QoS), has become a vital aspect of cooperative ITS (C-ITS). With these emerging characteristics, the classical passing-through-intersection problem has gained new connotations, worth further exploring. After analyzing the essences of this new problem, service-oriented cooperation models and mechanisms for whole autonomous vehicles approaching intersections are investigated in this paper. First, related traffic objects and possible vehicular behaviors are abstracted and modeled with the cyber-physical cooperative features and QoS constraints. A new reservation-based scheduling procedure is then conducted by employing the concepts of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and typical vehicular passing-through behaviors and several spatial-temporal constraints are designed to coordinate vehicles passing through an intersection divided as a series of continuous static critical sections. Given these considerations, a priority-based centralized scheduling algorithm, named csPriorFIFO, which adopts a novel priority inheritance mechanism to promote the traffic QoS of emergent vehicles, is proposed. Finally, all these designs are implemented in a traffic simulator named QoS-CITS, and the functions and the performance of these studied methods are verified and compared.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service-Oriented Cooperation Models and Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Driverless Vehicles at Continuous Static Critical Sections","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2016.2616492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7956367/07725527.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2616492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956367","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Service-Oriented Cooperation Models and Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Driverless Vehicles at Continuous Static Critical Sections","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7725527/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969445","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572403 and 61502394"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102015JSJ0002"},{"fundingName":"Post-Doctoral Research Project of Foundation Franco\u2013China for Science and Application","grantNumber":"FFCSA 2012"},{"fundingName":"International Chair Drive for All"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service-Oriented Cooperation Models and Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Driverless Vehicles at Continuous Static Critical Sections","sourcePdf":"tits-zhang-2616492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128658S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7725527","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725528,"authors":[{"name":"Adam B.

The synthesized grids do not correspond to any real grid and are, thus, free from confidentiality requirements. The cases are built to match statistical characteristics found in actual power grids. First, substations are geographically placed on a selected territory, synthesized from public information about the underlying population and generation plants. A clustering technique is employed, which ensures the synthetic substations meet realistic proportions of load and generation, among other constraints. Next, a network of transmission lines is added. This paper describes several structural statistics to be used in characterizing real power system networks, including connectivity, Delaunay triangulation overlap, dc power flow analysis, and line intersection rate. The paper presents a methodology to generate synthetic line topologies with realistic parameters that satisfy these criteria. Then, the test cases can be augmented with additional complexities to build large, realistic cases.

highly scalable sensor design for late transition detection in FPGA based platforms. Transition delays occur because of aging mechanisms such as Biased Temperature Instability(BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI). We propose a sensor clock (SCLK) that is a function of minimum slack time of a set of paths selected for age monitoring. There will be one such clock for many sensors as are needed in an entire FPGA. Our proposed sensor architecture makes it possible for a single SCLK to be shared by all sensors. Additionally, the proposed sensor occupies one slice (basic FPGA logic block), which leads to low area, power, and performance overhead. Using Artix-7-based board, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aging sensor detects aging earlier than existing sensors and provides less power and performance overheads.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2016.2622688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7893086/07725540.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7893086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2622688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SENSIBle: A Highly Scalable SENsor DeSIgn for Path-Based Age Monitoring in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"SENSIBle: A Highly Scalable SENsor DeSIgn for Path-Based Age Monitoring in FPGAs","htmlLink":"/document/7725540/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2017","publicationDate":"1 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16824251","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SENSIBle: A Highly Scalable SENsor DeSIgn for Path-Based Age Monitoring in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tc-ghaderi-2622688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067817S","chronDate":"May 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7893086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7893086","articleId":"7725540","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725543,"authors":[{"name":"Juwendo Denis","affiliation":["CEDRIC/LAETITIA Laboratory, Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7725543/denis-2622563-small.gif","p":["Juwendo Denis (M\u201916) received the Bachelor of Engineering\n degree in electrical engineering in 2011 and the Master of Science degree from the Institute of Communication\n Engineering in 2013, all from National Tsing Hua University, HsinChu, Taiwan, R.O.C.

More specifically, we investigate the problem of secondary users' energy-efficiency (EE) maximization problem under secondary total power and primary interference constraints. First, assuming cooperation among the secondary base stations (BSs), a centralized approach is considered to solve the EE optimization problem for the CR network where the primary and secondary users are using either orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or filter bank based multicarrier (FBMC) modulations. We propose an alternating-based approach to solve the joint power-subcarrier allocation problem. More importantly, in the first place, subcarriers are allocated using a heuristic method for a given feasible power allocation. Then, we conservatively approximate the nonconvex power control problem and propose a joint successive convex approximation-Dinkelbach algorithm (SCADA) to efficiently obtain a solution to the nonconvex power control problem. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to a solution that coincides with the stationary point of the original nonconvex power control subproblem. Moreover, we propose a dual decomposition-based decentralized version of the SCADA. Second, under the assumption of no cooperation among the secondary BSs, we propose a fully distributed power control algorithm from the perspective of game theory. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to a Nash-equilibrium (NE) point. Moreover, we propose a sufficient condition that guarantees the uniqueness of the achieved NE. Extensive simulation analyses are further provided to highlight the advantages and demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2622563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07725543.pdf","startPage":"4997","endPage":"5013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2622563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficiency-Based Resource Allocation Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks With FBMC/OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725543/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency-Based Resource Allocation Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks With FBMC/OFDM","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965031","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725543/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French ACCENT5","grantNumber":"ANR-14-CE28-0026-01I"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficiency-Based Resource Allocation Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks With FBMC/OFDM","sourcePdf":"tvt-denis-2622563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154205S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7725543","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725544,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Lindberg","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6884276/7931734/7725544/lindb-2623091-small.gif","p":["Christopher Lindberg received the B.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering, the M.Sc. degree in engineering mathematics and computational science, and the Licentiate of Engineering\n degree in electrical engineering in 2010, 2012, and 2015, respectively, from Chalmers University of Technology,\n Gothenburg, Sweden, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Communication Systems Group, Department\n of Signals and Systems.

In a setting where a sink reconstructs a field based on measurements from a wireless sensor network, this transform is tied to the locations of the individual sensors, which may not be available to the sink during reconstruction. In contrast to previous works, we do not assume that the sink knows the position of each sensor to build up the sparsifying basis. Instead, we propose the use of spatial interpolation based on a predetermined sparsifying transform, followed by random linear projections and ratio consensus using local communication between sensors. For this proposed architecture, we upper bound the reconstruction error induced by spatial interpolation, as well as the reconstruction error induced by distributed compression. These upper bounds are then utilized to analyze the communication cost tradeoff between communication to the sink and sensor-to-sensor communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing

This device is capable of 64-levels conductance states because of their optimized interface between the metal electrode and the TiOx film. To compensate the change in switching power with increasing pulse number, we propose the use of fixed voltage and current pulses in potentiation and depression conditions, respectively. By adopting a hybrid pulse scheme, the symmetry of conductance change under both potentiation and depression conditions is shown to be significantly improved. Both the improved conductance levels and the symmetry of conductance change are directly related with enhanced pattern recognition accuracy, which is confirmed by a neural network simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"37","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16486491","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7725546/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"TiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-Based RRAM Synapse With 64-Levels of Conductance and Symmetric Conductance Change by Adopting a Hybrid Pulse Scheme for Neuromorphic Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning through the Pioneer Research Center Program within the National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2012-0009460"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TiO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-Based RRAM Synapse With 64-Levels of Conductance and Symmetric Conductance Change by Adopting a Hybrid Pulse Scheme for Neuromorphic Computing","sourcePdf":"led-hwang-2622716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106464S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7739309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7739309","articleId":"7725546","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7725551,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Awad","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7725551/awad-2616840-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Awad received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the Department of Computer Systems Engineering, Birzeit University, Birzeit, Palestine, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, OPC is getting more aggressive to keep pace with advanced technology nodes. This results in complex mask solutions and long computation time. In this paper, we propose a novel-intensity-based OPC algorithm to find mask solutions with minimal edge placement error and process variability band area within a short computation time. This is achieved through exploiting a fast novel intensity estimation model with acceptable estimation accuracy to guide the OPC response including two-fragment shifting, corner hammering, and subresolution assist feature insertion for better convergence. Moreover, our algorithm is extended to satisfy the mask notch rule and reduce shot count for a lower mask manufacturing cost. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms recently published algorithms on the public benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2616840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2616840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7862316/07725551.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Process-Variation-Aware Mask Optimization Algorithm With a Novel Intensity Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Process-Variation-Aware Mask Optimization Algorithm With a Novel Intensity Modeling","volume":"25","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725551/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16691016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725551/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPSKAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"25280013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Process-Variation-Aware Mask Optimization Algorithm With a Novel Intensity Modeling","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-awad-2616840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145432S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7862316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7862316","articleId":"7725551","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725555,"authors":[{"name":"Taejoong Song","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7811159/7725555/song-2609386-small.gif","p":["Taejoong Song received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2010.","In 1997, he joined Samsung Electronics, where he developed SRAM compiler.

To improve the e-beam patterning accuracy of the grating etch masks, we apply proximity-effect compensation on the gratings and tapers. The linear characterization results indicate a waveguide attenuation of 6.5 dB/mm and a grating transmission of -6.3 dB in the fiber-optic communication C band.

The TI-DANSE algorithm is shown to converge to the same optimal node-specific signal estimates as if each node were to transmit its raw (uncompressed) sensor signal observations to every other node in the WSN. The TI-DANSE algorithm is first introduced in a fully connected WSN and then shown, in fact, to have the same convergence properties in any topology. When implemented in other topologies, the nodes rely on an in-network summation of the transmitted compressed observations that can be accomplished by various means. We propose a method for this in-network summation via a data-driven signal flow that takes place on a tree, where the topology of the tree may change in each iteration. This makes the algorithm less sensitive to link failures and applicable to WSNs with dynamic topologies.","doi":"10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2623095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6884276/7847472/07725559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2623095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847472","startPage":"130","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology-Independent Distributed Adaptive Node-Specific Signal Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topology-Independent Distributed Adaptive Node-Specific Signal Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17807103","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725559/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Future and Emerging Technologies (FET)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology-Independent Distributed Adaptive Node-Specific Signal Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsipn-szurley-2623095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119193S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6884276","isNumber":"7847472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6884276","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7847472","articleId":"7725559","onlineDate":"28 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725561,"authors":[{"name":"Immanuel Raja","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7725561/raja-2614695-small.gif","p":["Immanuel Raja (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2011.

Various MIMO configurations based on Single-User (SU)-MIMO, Multi-User (MU)-MIMO, network-MIMO architectures have been proposed for LTE systems. To accommodate the ever-increasing demands of different multimedia services and applications, the evolving next-generation wireless access networks are envisioned to support 1,000-fold gains in capacity, connections for billions of diverse devices, and Gb/s individual user data rates. Massive MIMO has emerged as a promising technology to deal with such challenges. Through the use of an excessively large number of service antennas in a fully coherent and adaptive operation, transmission and reception of signal energy can be focused into small regions to offer large improvements in throughput and energy efficiency, especially when combined with multi-user scheduling and in mmWave bands. Furthermore, massive MIMO can enhance the robustness to interference and intentional jamming.

The numerical results show that fiber dispersion and fading are key factors that limit the link performance. Therefore, dispersion shifted fibers should be used to reduce the effect of dispersion so as to improve the bit-error rate. To mitigate the effect of multipath fading, the remote radio heads (RRHs) or users should be located as near the remote antenna unit (RAU) as possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725641/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16427022","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725641/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MMW/RoF link in broadband optical-wireless access networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MMW/RoF link in broadband optical-wireless access networks","confLoc":"Danang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p153pham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057451S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593173","isNumber":"7725613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593173","xplore-issue":"7725613","articleId":"7725641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725650,"authors":[{"name":"Thi-Thanh-Dung Phan","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thi-Thanh-Dung","lastName":"Phan","id":"37085897321"},{"name":"Van-Phuc Hoang","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Van-Phuc","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38488802300"},{"name":"Van-Lan Dao","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Van-Lan","lastName":"Dao","id":"37085861166"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2100-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2098-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2099-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2101-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725650","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","IP networks","Wireless communication","Payloads","Body area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient FPGA implementation","AES-CCM authenticated encryption IP core","iterative structure","message security","MAC level","AES forward cipher function","counter mode","cipher block chaining mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES-CCM","authenticated encryption","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient AES-CCM IP core by combining a compact 8-bit AES encryption core and iterative structure.

It is shown that, given the channel state information at the source nodes and the relay, the zero-forcing precoding at all source nodes, the zero-forcing reception and zero-forcing transmission (ZFR/ZFT) or the zero-forcing reception and maximum ratio transmission (ZFR/MRT) at relay can be employed to mitigate inter-pair interference. The asymptotical analysis shows that, the required transmit power at relay can be made inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas without sacrificing the achieved energy efficiency.

To tackle the non-convexity of the secure energy efficiency maximization (SEEM) problem, we employ branch-and-reduce-and-bound (BRB) approach to obtain the globally optimal solution. It is observed that the BRB algorithm suffers from highly computational cost, its globally optimal solution is importantly served as a benchmark for the performance evaluation of the suboptimal algorithms. This motivates us to develop a low-complexity approach using the well-known zero-forcing (ZF) technique to cancel the wiretapped signal. In ZF based method, the SEEM problem can be transformed to a concave-convex fractional one and, then, be solved by the combination of the Dinkelbach and bisection search algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the ZF based method can converge fast and obtain a sub-optimal performance in compared with the optimal solution of the BRB method. The ZF based scheme also outperforms the conventional secrecy rate maximization precoder design in terms of the energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal precoder designs for energy-efficiency maximization in secure MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","doi":"10.1109/NICS.2016.7725666","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593173/7725613/07725666.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NICS.2016.7725666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal precoder designs for energy-efficiency maximization in secure MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725666/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427021","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal precoder designs for energy-efficiency maximization in secure MIMO systems","confLoc":"Danang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p50vu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105121S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593173","isNumber":"7725613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593173","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7725613","articleId":"7725666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725671,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Nam Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, Hanoi"],"firstName":"Xuan Nam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085884264"},{"name":"Dai Tho Nguyen","affiliation":["UMI209UMMISCO IRD/UPMC"],"firstName":"Dai Tho","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37599194500"},{"name":"Long Hai Vu","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

The experiment results also show that POCAD outperforms state of the art payload-based detection schemes such as McPAD [4] and PAYL [8].","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POCAD: A novel pay load-based one-class classifier for anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","doi":"10.1109/NICS.2016.7725671","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593173/7725613/07725671.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NICS.2016.7725671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7725613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"POCAD: A novel pay load-based one-class classifier for anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725671/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POCAD: A novel pay load-based one-class classifier for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Danang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p74nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045961S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593173","isNumber":"7725613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593173","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7725613","articleId":"7725671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7725675,"authors":[{"name":"Van-Tinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Van-Tinh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085891372"},{"name":"Van-Lan Dao","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Van-Lan","lastName":"Dao","id":"37085861166"},{"name":"Thi-Thanh-Dung Phan","affiliation":["Le Quy Don Technical University, Hanoi, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Thi-Thanh-Dung","lastName":"Phan","id":"37085897321"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2100-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2098-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2099-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2101-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7725675","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","cyclic codes","dividing circuits","error correction","field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes error correction","FPGA","codec system","dividing circuits principle","Meggitt decoder","look-up table method","LUT method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["encode","decode","fpga","cyclic"]}],"abstract":"This paper designs and implements a codec system using the Cyclic code on FPGA.

A definition of security in probability is adopted to account for the transient dynamics of controlled systems. The purpose of the problem under consideration is to design a dynamic output feedback controller such that the prescribed security in probability is guaranteed while obtaining an upper bound of the quadratic cost criterion. First of all, some sufficient conditions with the form of matrix inequalities are established in the framework of the input-to-state stability in probability. Then, an easy-solution version on above inequalities is proposed by carrying out the well-known matrix inverse lemma to obtain both the controller gain and the upper bound. Furthermore, the main results are shown to be extendable to the case of discrete-time stochastic linear systems. Finally, two simulation examples are utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller design scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2616544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2616544","startPage":"779","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8337043/07725916.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8337043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Control for Discrete-Time Stochastic Nonlinear Systems Subject to Deception Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Security Control for Discrete-Time Stochastic Nonlinear Systems Subject to Deception Attacks","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17684566","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7725916/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society of the U.K."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61329301, 61573246 and 61374039"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Rising-Star Program of China","grantNumber":"16QA1403000"},{"fundingName":"Program for Capability Construction of Shanghai Provincial Universities","grantNumber":"15550502500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Control for Discrete-Time Stochastic Nonlinear Systems Subject to Deception Attacks","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2616544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116596S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8337043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"8337043","articleId":"7725916","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7725918,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7725918/chen-2623308-small.gif","p":["Weiwei Chen received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications University, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2013.

Previously, slot assignment has been done on a link basis, where a set of links is selected for transmission in a given slot. However, if selected links are in deep fade or have no traffic to transmit, the slot is wasted. Thus, a node-based scheme was proposed, where a set of nodes is selected for transmission. Which link to be used by a node depends on the links' instantaneous traffic load. Although this allows us to exploit multi-user diversity, it creates a planning discrepancy: slot assignment is designed based on long-term channel statistics, but scheduling on short-term channel fading conditions. Consequently, the performance gain of the node-based scheme is not consistent: it is marginal under certain scenarios. To avoid the design discrepancy, we develop a new slot-assignment and routing framework in this paper. The new approach incorporates short-term channel fading statistics to optimize the long term slot assignment, routing and scheduling simultaneously. Hence, multi-user diversity can be exploited more efficiently. Not only is the performance gain of the resulting system significant (can be as much as 64% higher throughput than the scheme introduced by Chen and Lea), it is also less topology dependent compared with the one by Chen and Lea.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2623308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","startPage":"320","endPage":"331","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07725918.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2623308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Routing and Scheduling for Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Fading channels","Routing","Modulation","Scheduling","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","telecommunication channels","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication scheduling","time division multiple access","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic routing","opportunistic scheduling","spatial time division multiple access wireless mesh networks","SINR","node-based scheme","multiuser diversity","long-term channel statistics","short-term channel fading conditions","short-term channel fading statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic scheduling","multi-user diversity","multi-hop wireless networks","STDMA networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Routing and Scheduling for Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7725918/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618439","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC","grantNumber":"16206015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61501528"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Routing and Scheduling for Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2623308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7725918","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725919,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Newcastle Australia, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7725919/shirv-2623305-small.gif","p":["Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Sydney, Australia, in 2015, all in electrical engineering.

Given the exponential growth of MTC traffic, it is of utmost importance to ensure that future wireless standards are capable of handling this traffic. In this paper, we focus on the design of a very efficient massive access strategy for highly dense cellular networks with M2M communications. Several MTC devices are allowed to simultaneously transmit in the same resource block by incorporating Raptor codes and a simple modulation scheme. This significantly reduces the access delay and improves the achievable system throughput. A simple yet efficient random access strategy is proposed to not only detect the selected preambles, but also estimate the number of devices which have chosen them. No device identification is needed in the random access phase which significantly reduces the signaling overhead. The proposed scheme is analyzed and the maximum number of MTC devices that can be supported in a resource block is characterized as a function of the message length, number of available resources, and the number of preambles. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively support a massive number of MTC devices for a limited number of available resources, when the message size is small.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2623305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07725919.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2623305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive Multiple Access Based on Superposition Raptor Codes for Cellular M2M Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725919/","displayDocTitle":"Massive Multiple Access Based on Superposition Raptor Codes for Cellular M2M Communications","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618466","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725919/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"LP130100783 and FT110100195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive Multiple Access Based on Superposition Raptor Codes for Cellular M2M Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-shirvanimoghaddam-2623305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087566S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7725919","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725920,"authors":[{"name":"Taotao Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","Institute of Network Coding, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7725920/wang-2623301-small.gif","p":["Taotao Wang (M\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2008, the M.S. degree in information and signal processing from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2015.

MSDD is an effective means to improving the performance of noncoherent differential UWB-IR systems. To optimize the overall detection and decoding performance, this paper proposes a novel soft-in soft-out (SISO) MSDD scheme for noncoherent differential UWB-IR. We first propose a new sampling mechanism for the noncoherent auto-correlation receiver to sample the received UWB-IR signal. The proposed sampling mechanism can exploit the dependences (imposed by the differential modulation) among data symbols throughout the whole packet. The signal probabilistic model has a hidden Markov chain structure. We use a factor graph to represent this hidden Markov chain. Then, we apply BP message passing algorithm on the factor graph to develop an SISO MSDD scheme, which is easy to integrate with SISO channel decoding to form a joint MSDD and channel decoding scheme. Performance results of bit error rate simulations and EXIT chart analyses indicate the performance advantages of our scheme over the previous MSDD scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725920/","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7725920/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618428","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Multiple Symbol Differential Detection and Channel Decoding for Noncoherent UWB Impulse Radio by Belief Propagation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61372078"},{"fundingName":"NSF Guangdong","grantNumber":"2014A030313549"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"2016055"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61401041"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Multiple Symbol Differential Detection and Channel Decoding for Noncoherent UWB Impulse Radio by Belief Propagation","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2623301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111641S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7725920","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7725934,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Farooq","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Farooq","orcid":"0000-0002-1208-1245","id":"37085674399"},{"name":"Ali Imran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Imran","id":"37572812400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7725934","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1082},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Predictive models","Markov processes","Wireless LAN","5G mobile communication","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Markov processes","mobility management (mobile radio)","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal mobility prediction","proactive self-organizing cellular networks","cellular network management efficiency","actual handover","seamless handover","user traffic distribution forecasting","semi-Markov model","steady state analysis","gain analysis","smart phone application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-Markov","mobility prediction","self-organizing networks (SON)","5G"]}],"abstract":"Mobility prediction, one of the key enablers of proactive self-organizing networks, aims at efficient management of future cellular networks, which are envisaged to be extremely dense and complex due to conglomeration of diverse technologies.

Particularly, we present the first implementation of the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange, which features quantum-resistance. We optimize this design for speed by creating a high throughput multiplier unit, taking advantage of parallelization of arithmetic in F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p2</sub>\n, and minimizing pipeline stalls with optimal scheduling. Consequently, our results are also faster than software libraries running affine SIDH even on Intel Haswell processors. For our implementation at 85-bit quantum security and 128-bit classical security, we generate ephemeral public keys in 1.655 million cycles for Alice and 1.490 million cycles for Bob. We generate the shared secret in an additional 1.510 million cycles for Alice and 1.312 million cycles for Bob. On a Virtex-7, these results are approximately 1.5 times faster than known software implementations running the same 512-bit SIDH. Our results and observations show that the isogeny-based schemes can be implemented with high efficiency on reconfigurable hardware.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2611561","startPage":"86","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7809129/07725935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-Quantum Cryptography on FPGA Based on Isogenies on Elliptic Curves","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7809129/7725935-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Post-Quantum Cryptography on FPGA Based on Isogenies on Elliptic Curves","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618486","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Post-Quantum Cryptography on FPGA Based on Isogenies on Elliptic Curves","sourcePdf":"tcsi-azarderakhsh-2611561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143508S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7725935","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725937,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7855861/7725937/swang-2622761-small.gif","p":["Shuo Wang received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the\n Shenyang Architecture and Civil Engineering Institute, Shenyang, China, the M.E. degree in industrial automation from\n the Northeastern University, Shenyang, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the\n Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1995, 1998 and 2001, respectively.","He is currently a Professor in the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of\n Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Due to prohibitive memory footprint of city-scale point clouds, image-based localization is difficult to be implemented on devices with limited memory resources. Point cloud simplification aims to select a subset of points to achieve a comparable localization performance using the original point cloud. In this paper, we propose a data-driven point cloud simplification framework by taking it as a weighted K-Cover problem, which mainly includes two complementary parts. First, a utility-based parameter determination method is proposed to select a reasonable parameter K for K-Cover-based approaches by evaluating the potential of a point cloud for establishing sufficient 2D-3D feature correspondences. Second, we formulate the 3D point cloud simplification problem as a weighted K-Cover problem, and propose an adaptive exponential weight function based on the visibility probability of 3D points. The experimental results on three popular datasets demonstrate that the proposed point cloud simplification framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the image-based localization application with a well predicted parameter in the K-Cover problem.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2623488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2623488","startPage":"262","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7743013/07725940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7743013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Point Cloud Simplification Framework for City-Scale Image-Based Localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Point Cloud Simplification Framework for City-Scale Image-Based Localization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725940/","accessionNumber":"16481634","pubMedId":"27831876","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725940/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Prime Minsters Office, Singapore, under its International Research Centers in Singapore Funding Initiative"},{"fundingName":"Singapore MoE Tier 1 Project","grantNumber":"M4011379 and RG141/14"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Point Cloud Simplification Framework for City-Scale Image-Based Localization","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2623488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146168S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7743013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7743013","articleId":"7725940","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7725948,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Lin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7725948/huang-2623478-small.gif","p":["Xin-Lin Huang (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201916) received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In CR devices, accurate spectrum sensing is the prerequisite for opportunistic access. The current cooperative spectrum sensing still cannot effectively exploit the temporal correlations among sensing data, especially the correlations between the current sensing data and the historical data. This paper uses sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process-hidden Markov model to exploit the historical sensing data of multiple users, and classifies the historical sensing data into groups according to their latent spectrum states. The proposed spectrum sensing algorithm can fuse the historical sensing data into prior knowledge, which can be used to improve the accuracy in spectrum decision. Furthermore, a rejection process is proposed to filter out some sensing data with high uncertainty in classification, which guarantees the effectiveness of historical sensing data. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs the best, compared with other three typical cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms, in terms of detection probability and false alarm probability. Specifically, when the false alarm probability is 0.2, the proposed algorithm has more than 10% and 60% detection probability improvement under channel signal-to-noise ratio as 0 and -5 dB, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470575","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725948/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing With Data Mining of Multiple Users\u2019 Historical Sensing Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61390513 and 61631017"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Pujiang Program","grantNumber":"13PJD030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003024","fundingName":"Chen Guang Project through the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation","grantNumber":"13CG18"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301159"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M571635 and 2016T90404"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing With Data Mining of Multiple Users\u2019 Historical Sensing Data","sourcePdf":"access-huang-2623478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079231S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7725948","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725952,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Vales-Alonso","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Vales-Alonso","id":"38272160000"},{"name":"Juan Pedro Mu\u00f1oz-Gea","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Pedro","lastName":"Mu\u00f1oz-Gea","id":"38270593800"},{"name":"Juan J.

As the smart home networks continue to grow in size and complexity, it is essential to address a handful among the myriads of challenges related to data loss due to the interference and efficient energy management. In this paper, we propose a smart home control system using a coordinator-based ZigBee networking. The working of the proposed system is three fold: smart interference control system controls the interference caused due to the co-existence of IEEE 802.11x-based wireless local area networks and wireless sensor networks; smart energy control system is developed to integrate sunlight with light source and optimizes the energy consumption of the household appliances by controlling the unnecessary energy demands; and smart management control system to efficiently control the operating time of the electronic appliances. The performance of the proposed smart home is testified through computer simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed smart home system is less affected by the interference and efficient in reducing the energy consumption of the appliances used in a smart home.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621752","startPage":"7556","endPage":"7566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07725957.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet of Things Based Energy Aware Smart Home Control System","topic":"Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Internet of Things Based Energy Aware Smart Home Control System","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470550","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7725957/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BK21 Plus Project SW Human Resource Development Program for Supporting Smart Life by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, South Korea","grantNumber":"21A20131600005"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education(2016R1D1A1B03933566)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Internet of Things Based Energy Aware Smart Home Control System","sourcePdf":"access-khan-2621752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066893S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications"],"articleId":"7725957","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725961,"authors":[{"name":"Irene Pappalardo","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Irene","lastName":"Pappalardo","id":"37085620529"},{"name":"Andrea Zanella","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Zanella","orcid":"0000-0003-3671-5190","id":"37286693000"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7725961","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Handover","Upper bound","Rayleigh channels","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["upper bound analysis","handover performance","HetNets","heterogeneous networks","network utility functions","channel noncausal knowledge","base stations","comparative performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication switching","handover communications technology","computer networks","heterogeneous networks information theory","performance evaluation"]}],"abstract":"Handover in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is an interesting research challenge that has attracted considerable attention in recent years, producing a variety of handover schemes that are difficult to compare because they differ in the considered assumptions and target user/network utility functions.

This is realized by continuously redistributing the parasitic charge in-between phase-shifted converter cores. Because earlier models described the ratio of this parasitic coupling to the flying capacitance as the only limiting factor on the achievable fully integrated efficiency, the use of SPCR allows SC converters to achieve efficiencies previously deemed impossible.

An analytical SER expression for a D2D system using multicarrier bandlimited QAM is derived and then used in the resource allocation algorithm. We consider centralized resource allocation for the D2D system, given knowledge of the channel state information and the rate distortion information of the video streams, and propose an iterative algorithm for subcarrier assignment and power allocation. Bit-level simulations for different numbers of D2D pairs demonstrate a considerable improvement on user capacity and video peak signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating the proposed SER expression compared with the GA. By invoking the conditions under which the central limit theorem holds, and comparing these conditions with the number of interferers and the power ratio of the dominant interferer in the simulated D2D system, we also study why the GA for the interference degrades performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8068314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8068314/07725969.pdf","startPage":"4446","endPage":"4462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multicarrier Device-to-Device Video Transmission: Symbol Error Rate Analysis and Algorithm Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multicarrier Device-to-Device Video Transmission: Symbol Error Rate Analysis and Algorithm Design","volume":"65","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725969/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17243593","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725969/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-14-1-0340"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multicarrier Device-to-Device Video Transmission: Symbol Error Rate Analysis and Algorithm Design","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wu-2623313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113337S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8068314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8068314","articleId":"7725969","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725970,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Resnati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Resnati","id":"37085335333"},{"name":"Gianluca Nicosia","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Nicosia","id":"37085647443"},{"name":"Giovanni M.

However, lack of a dc-dc converter precludes the electronic load operating under the voltage for optimal energy efficiency, since the output voltage of the energy harvester is set as the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) voltage. To mitigate efficiency loss of workload, we propose an architecture to achieve maximum energy efficiency tracking for the overall sensor node. A theoretical analysis is given for the architecture and an efficiency-driven frequency controller is fabricated to validate the design methodology. Measured results demonstrate that up to 162% performance gain of the overall sensor node is achieved compared with the existing systems with MPPT.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8920/7934201/7725972-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","volume":"64","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"16930303","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7725972/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Energy Efficiency Tracking Circuits for Converter-Less Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61674094 and 61271269"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chip and High-Tech Research and Development (863) Program","grantNumber":"2013AA013201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF Awards (ASSIST)","grantNumber":"1160483"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007245","fundingName":"Center for Low Energy Systems Technology (LEAST) through by MARCO and DARPA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Maximum Energy Efficiency Tracking Circuits for Converter-Less Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes","sourcePdf":"tcsii-liu-2623354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062276S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7934201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7934201","articleId":"7725972","onlineDate":"23 May 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7725973,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085451580"},{"name":"En Xia Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"En Xia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37591455500"},{"name":"Ronald D.

others. Despite the increasing amount of efforts in learning based methods to tackle this problem, there still lack proper data-driven feature construction mechanisms to sufficiently encode contextual labelling information, which might hinder the segmentation performance. This observation prompts us to propose a data-driven approach to learn structured and contextual features in this paper. The structured features aim to integrate local spatial label patterns into the feature space, thus endowing the follow-up tree classifiers capability to grouping training examples with similar structure into the same leaf node when splitting the feature space, and further yielding contextual features to capture more of the global contextual information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts on well-regarded testbeds over a variety of applications. Our code is also made publicly available in support of the open-source research activities.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2016.2623357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7839249/07725981.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"606","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2016.2623357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segment 2D and 3D Filaments by Learning Structured and Contextual Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Segment 2D and 3D Filaments by Learning Structured and Contextual Features","volume":"36","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7725981/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638841","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","pubMedId":"27831862","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A*STAR JCO","grantNumber":"1231BFG040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segment 2D and 3D Filaments by Learning Structured and Contextual Features","sourcePdf":"tmi-cheng-2623357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128307S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7839249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7839249","articleId":"7725981","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7725990,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7849237/7725990/sun-2623258-small.gif","p":["Ning Sun (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in\n measurement and control technology and instruments (with honors) from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2009, and the\n Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering (with honors) from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2014.\n","He is currently with the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.\n His research interests include cranes, wheeled robots, magnetic suspension systems, and nonlinear control with\n applications to mechatronic systems.","Dr. Sun is a member of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Technical Committee on Control, Robotics, and\n Mechatronics and serves as a program committee member for several international conferences.

However, in practice, when the hook mass is nonnegligible or the cargo has a large size, the crane always exhibits double-pendulum swing dynamics, which is much more complicated and makes most existing control methods unapplicable. In addition, all existing closed-loop controllers for (double-pendulum) cranes require full state feedback, while velocities are unavailable in most cases. Moreover, they need to linearize the nonlinear crane model and cannot respect the actuator's practical saturation constraint, which may probably lead to actuator saturation and badly degrade the control performance (even unstable). In response to these practical issues, we suggest a novel amplitude-saturated output feedback (OFB) control approach for underactuated crane systems exhibiting double-pendulum effects. We provide explicit Lyapunov-based analysis to rigorously prove that the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is almost globally asymptotically stable, without any approximation to the original nonlinear dynamics. As far as we know, this paper presents the first closed-loop control method that can achieve control for an underactuated double-pendulum crane with merely OFB and theoretically-guaranteed saturated control efforts. Hardware experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over existing methods and its strong robustness as well.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2623258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07725990.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2623258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"2135","endPage":"2146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude-Saturated Nonlinear Output Feedback Antiswing Control for Underactuated Cranes With Double-Pendulum Cargo Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7725990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude-Saturated Nonlinear Output Feedback Antiswing Control for Underactuated Cranes With Double-Pendulum Cargo Dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725990/","volume":"64","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7725990/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16668359","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61325017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin","grantNumber":"15JCQNJC03800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600186"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude-Saturated Nonlinear Output Feedback Antiswing Control for Underactuated Cranes With Double-Pendulum Cargo Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tie-fang-2623258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104269S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7725990","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7725993,"authors":[{"name":"Junsik Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7725993/park-2615620-small.gif","p":["Junsik Park received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include the partial element equivalent circuit and electrostatic discharge."]},"firstName":"Junsik","lastName":"Park","id":"37085387845"},{"name":"Jongsung Lee","affiliation":["Global Technology Center, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7725993/lee-2615620-small.gif","p":["Jongsung Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","Since 2004, he has been with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea.

The operation of a DHSS involves amplitude scaling and summing a set of square-waves to produce a sampled sine-wave. The circuit which performs the scaling and summing operation is referred to as the harmonic-cancelling digital-to-analog converter (HC-DAC). Unlike a regular DAC whose amplitude weights are defined by powers of two, an HC-DAC's amplitude weights are defined by a sine function. Thus, HC-DACs present intriguing design problems which cannot be solved using the conventional knowledge gathered from designing regular DACs. One such problem is managing the effect of mismatch between unit-elements in HC-DACs. This paper proposes a partial dynamic element matching (DEM) technique tailored for HC-DACs, which reduces the effect of mismatch, while preserving the power and area efficiency of DHSSs. The effectiveness of the DEM technique is evaluated using a DHSS circuit fabricated in an STMicroelectronics 130 nm CMOS technology. Test results show that applying the DEM technique increased the figure-of-merit of the DHSS by 40% at 2 MHz output frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2613938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2613938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7835743/07725999.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Dynamic Element Matching Technique for Digital-to-Analog Converters Used for Digital Harmonic-Cancelling Sine-Wave Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Partial Dynamic Element Matching Technique for Digital-to-Analog Converters Used for Digital Harmonic-Cancelling Sine-Wave Synthesis","volume":"64","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7725999/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16637915","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7725999/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Dynamic Element Matching Technique for Digital-to-Analog Converters Used for Digital Harmonic-Cancelling Sine-Wave Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tcsi-aluthwala-2613938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104569S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7835743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7835743","articleId":"7725999","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726000,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo S.

Thanks to the spectral characteristics of the new modulation, in particular, the requirements of the filter needed to extract the baseband component of DPWM signals can be significantly released so that to be suitable to inexpensive integration on silicon in analog interfaces for nanoscale integrated systems. After the new DDPM technique and its properties are introduced on a theoretical basis, the implementation of a D/A converter (DAC) based on the proposed modulation is addressed and its performance in terms of noise and linearity is discussed. A 16-bit DDPM-DAC prototype is finally synthesized on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and experimentally characterized.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2614231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7862955/07726000.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2614231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Digital High Resolution D/A Conversion by Dyadic Digital Pulse Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"All-Digital High Resolution D/A Conversion by Dyadic Digital Pulse Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726000/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16706735","htmlLink":"/document/7726000/","volume":"64","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Digital High Resolution D/A Conversion by Dyadic Digital Pulse Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-crovetti-2614231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088025S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7862955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7862955","articleId":"7726000","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726003,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Zhou","affiliation":["VIRTUS, IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7862955/7726003/zhou-2616907-small.gif","p":["Jia Zhou received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Since small cell base stations (SBSs) are randomly deployed, loads of them are usually different. In this letter, we aim to maximize the load-aware weighted sum of EEs (LWSEEs) across all subchannels in DSCNs jointly considering SBSs' loads and users' signal processing power through power allocation. First, we design the EE weight as a function of load factor (LF). Then, the LWSEE optimization problem is formulated as a non-concave sum-of-ratios optimization and we present the optimal LWSEE algorithm to tackle the problem based on the concave-convex procedure method. Furthermore, a simplified LWSEE (LWSEE-simp) algorithm where SBSs form interference groups is developed to reduce the signaling overhead in DSCNs. Simulation results show that SBSs' sum-EEs can be optimized according to their LFs and the optimal interference group size exists in the LWSEE-simp algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2620173","startPage":"366","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07726004.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Aware Energy Efficiency Optimization in Dense Small Cell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Load-Aware Energy Efficiency Optimization in Dense Small Cell Networks","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668399","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7726004/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Chinese National Nature Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61571062"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Aware Energy Efficiency Optimization in Dense Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-xia-2620173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073694S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7726004","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726009,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu Yin Zhang","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Short-Range Wireless Detection and Communication (Grant No 2014B030301010), School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7862955/7726009/zhang-2614331-small.gif","p":["Xiu Yin Zhang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201912) was born in Hubei, China.

In the proposed topology, two output ports of the coupler are connected with two identical sub-rectifiers and the isolation port is directly connected to the ground. The input impedance of the two sub-rectifiers varies with different input power, operating frequency and output load, which leads to impedance mismatching. By using the branch-line coupler with grounded isolation port, the power reflected from the two sub-rectifiers can be partially re-injected back to the sub-rectifiers. Thus, the power can be reused and the RF-dc conversion efficiency can be improved. Theoretical analysis and performance comparison are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed topology is able to realize high efficiency with wide input power, frequency and load dynamic ranges. For validation, a rectifier working at 2.45 GHz is designed. The fabricated rectifier circuit demonstrates a maximum RF-dc conversion efficiency of 80.8%. The measured efficiency remains over 70% with the input power from 10 dBm to 18.6 dBm and the operating frequency from 2.08 to 2.58 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2614331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2614331","startPage":"731","endPage":"739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7862955/07726009.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Broadband Rectifier With Wide Ranges of Input Power and Output Load Based on Branch-Line Coupler","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Broadband Rectifier With Wide Ranges of Input Power and Output Load Based on Branch-Line Coupler","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16706751","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7726009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422106 and 61327005"},{"fundingName":"Top-Notch Young Talents Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Broadband Rectifier With Wide Ranges of Input Power and Output Load Based on Branch-Line Coupler","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhang-2614331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072403S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7862955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7862955","articleId":"7726009","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726011,"authors":[{"name":"Zaifeng Yang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zaifeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085341116"},{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng Leong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37272187200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7726011","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission lines","Finite difference methods","Stability analysis","Circuit stability","Time-domain analysis","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled transmission lines","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-one-dimensional FDTD method","coupled transmission lines","stability condition","M1-D finite-difference time-domain method","M1-D FDTD method","odd-mode approach","even-mode approach","update equation","real-time visualization","electromagnetic fields","microstrip filters","frequency domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled transmission lines","even- and odd-mode","FDTD","multiple 1-D","real-time visualization","stability condition"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents the multiple one-dimensional (M1-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for coupled transmission lines and its stability condition.

Microstrip filters with coupled lines are simulated to further validate the proposed method in frequency domain.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2615021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7736161/07726011.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2615021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple One-Dimensional FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines and Stability Condition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726011/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple One-Dimensional FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines and Stability Condition","volume":"26","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428076","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726011/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple One-Dimensional FDTD Method for Coupled Transmission Lines and Stability Condition","sourcePdf":"lmwc-yang-2615021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073204S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7736161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7736161","articleId":"7726011","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7726012,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7756694/7726012/wu-2623559-small.gif","p":["Bo Wu received the B.Eng. degree in electronic information\n engineering from Southwest University, Chongqing, China, in 2012.

There are three key steps in designing a robust system. First, in contrast to sigmoid activation and min-max normalization in state-of-the-art algorithms, a linear activation function at the output layer and global mean-variance normalization of target features are adopted to learn the complicated nonlinear mapping function from reverberant to anechoic speech and to improve the restoration of the low-frequency and intermediate-frequency contents. Next, two key design parameters, namely, frame shift size in speech framing and acoustic context window size at the DNN input, are investigated to show that RT60-dependent parameters are needed in the DNN training stage in order to optimize the system performance in diverse reverberant environments. Finally, the reverberation time is estimated to select the proper frame shift and context window sizes for feature extraction before feeding the log-power spectrum features to the trained DNNs for speech dereverberation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the conventional DNNs without taking the reverberation time into account, while achieving a performance only slightly worse than the oracle cases with known reverberation times even for extremely weak and severe reverberant conditions. It also generalizes well to unseen room sizes, loudspeaker and microphone positions, and recorded room impulse responses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16499465","htmlLink":"/document/7726012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Reverberation-Time-Aware Approach to Speech Dereverberation Based on Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571344"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reverberation-Time-Aware Approach to Speech Dereverberation Based on Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-wu-2623559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075679S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7756694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7756694","articleId":"7726012","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7726015,"authors":[{"name":"Zebing Feng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zebing","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0001-5865-6094","id":"37085540143"},{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086051151"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085676703"},{"name":"T.

This paper presents a new event-driven emergency load-shedding scheme that minimizes load shedding while meeting constraints on transient angle stability, voltage/frequency deviation security, and availability of load to be shed at any bus. The evaluation of these constraints is based on time domain trajectories provided by numerical simulations. The optimal event-driven load-shedding (OEDLS) model was created to minimize the total load-shedding cost. By analyzing the characteristics of the optimal solution of this model, a trajectory sensitivity based solution approach is presented. It linearizes the nonlinear OEDLS model through trajectory sensitivity and iteratively converges to the optimal solution. To accelerate the problem solving process, a parallel computation scheme is implemented for obtaining the trajectory sensitivities. The validity of the proposed algorithm and parallel computation scheme was tested and verified using two different power systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of the Event-Driven Emergency Load-Shedding Considering Transient Security and Stability Constraints","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2619364","endPage":"2592","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07726016.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"2581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2619364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Trajectory","Security","Stability analysis","Transient analysis","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load shedding","power system faults","power system security","power system transient stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven emergency load-shedding","transient security","stability constraints","emergency control","power system blackouts","transient angle stability","voltage deviation security","frequency deviation security","load availability","time domain trajectories","numerical simulations","optimal event-driven load-shedding model","trajectory sensitivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angle stability","frequency security","load-shedding","optimization algorithm","parallel computation","trajectory sensitivity","voltage security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of the Event-Driven Emergency Load-Shedding Considering Transient Security and Stability Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7726016/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969888","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB215101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51477092"},{"fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of the Event-Driven Emergency Load-Shedding Considering Transient Security and Stability Constraints","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2619364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10164S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7726016","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7726017,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Basanta-Val","affiliation":["University Carlos III of, Madrid and UC3M-BS Institute of Financial Big Data (IFiBiD), Leganes, Madrid,, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/7792246/7726017/val-2622719-small.gif","p":["Pablo Basanta-Val received the telecommunication engineering degree\n from the Universidad de Vigo, Spain, in 2001, Madrid, Spain, in 2007.

It deals with the definition of a time-critical big-data system from the point of view of requirements, analyzing the specific characteristics of some popular big-data applications.

For both cases, we elucidate their theoretical foundations of locating methods and propose an algorithm based on column coherence minimization, which optimally facilitates the reconstruction for CS framework.

The analysis is further extended to characterize a network-level performance metric, capturing the tradeoff between link quality and the fraction of receivers served. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the analytical model. Several useful insights are provided. For example, while more cooperation helps improve the link-level performance, the network-level performance might degrade with the cluster size. Numerical results show that a small cluster size (typically 3 or smaller) optimizes the network-level performance. Furthermore, substantial performance can be extracted with a relatively small energy buffer. Moreover, the utility of having a large energy buffer increases with the energy harvesting rate as well as with the cluster size in sufficiently dense networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623314","startPage":"3343","endPage":"3358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8010491/07726030.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8010491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Large-Scale Cooperative Wireless Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Large-Scale Cooperative Wireless Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17099674","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7726030/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MERL"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Large-Scale Cooperative Wireless Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kim-2623314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11523S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8010491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8010491","articleId":"7726030","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726031,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-Hun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085785777"},{"name":"Sun-Young Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sun-Young","lastName":"Jung","id":"37085386187"},{"name":"Sang-Min Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Min","lastName":"Jung","id":"38524856200"},{"name":"Sang-Kook Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Kook","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0002-4373-5088","id":"37278482700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7726031","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical transmitters","Virtual private networks","Optical fibers","Passive optical networks","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","band-pass filters","data communication","light interference","microwave photonics","OFDM modulation","optical delay lines","optical fibre couplers","optical fibre filters","optical links","optical transmitters","passive optical networks","Rayleigh scattering","spectral line broadening","virtual private networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical virtual private network","OFDM-PON","inter-communications","optical network units","passive optical network system","optical coupler based recirculating delay line","optical line terminal","optical subsystem","microwave photonic-bandpass filter","VPN signal transmission","optical phase-induced intensity noise","Rayleigh back-scattering interference","single-fiber loop back link","RF clipping tone based spectrum-broadening technique","uplink transmitter","all-optical VPN system","multiVPN data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave photonic filter","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","passive optical network (PON)","virtual private network (VPN)"]}],"abstract":"We propose and demonstrate a novel all-optical virtual private network (VPN) using a microwave photonic filter, which enables inter-communications among optical network units in a passive optical network system. In our scheme, an optical coupler based recirculating delay line is used at optical line terminal as an optical subsystem to implement a microwave photonic-bandpass filter (MP-BPF). The periodic passbands of an MP-BPF are used to transmit VPN signal, whereas stopbands are used for conventional upstream transmission. The proposed system has two critical issues, optical phase-induced intensity noise in the MP-BPF and Rayleigh back-scattering interference by a single-fiber loop back link. To overcome the issues, an RF clipping tone based spectrum-broadening technique is applied to uplink transmitter. The proposed all-optical VPN system is tolerant to wavelength of VPN optical carrier, and enables multi-VPN data transmission using multi-passbands of MP-BPF.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Virtual Private Network in OFDM-PON Using Microwave Photonic Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2016.2623334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7741041/07726031.pdf","startPage":"2830","endPage":"2833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2016.2623334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7741041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Virtual Private Network in OFDM-PON Using Microwave Photonic Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7726031/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2016","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"16481230","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D Program of MSIP/IITP, Republic of Korea, Access Network Control Techniques for Various IoT Services","grantNumber":"B0101-16-1276"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Virtual Private Network in OFDM-PON Using Microwave Photonic Filter","sourcePdf":"lpt-han-2623334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045017S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7741041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7741041","articleId":"7726031","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7726033,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Magesacher","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Magesacher","orcid":"0000-0002-3864-1482","id":"37294262400"},{"name":"Peter Singerl","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Singerl","id":"37422196700"},{"name":"Martin Mataln","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Mataln","id":"37085680774"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7726033","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Radio frequency","Splines (mathematics)","Power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Optimization","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","least squares approximations","linearisation techniques","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal segmentation","piecewise RF power amplifier models","digital predistortion system","phase-distortion","complex-valued functions","nonuniform segmentation","model coefficients","linearization improvement","Doherty power amplifier","reduced-complexity approach","performance loss","gain-distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","nonlinear least-squares","piecewise segmentation","power amplifier (PA)","spline"]}],"abstract":"Accurate modeling of an RF power amplifier and/or its inverse is the core element of every digital predistortion system. An interesting alternative to the family of classic polynomial models are piecewise models, which divide the magnitude range into segments and define gain/phase-distortion through complex-valued functions on a per-segment basis. Naturally, the question arises whether a well-chosen non-uniform segmentation outperforms straightforward uniform segmentation and whether the benefit outweighs the extra effort. This work has two contributions: First, the segmentation that is optimal in the least-squares sense is determined jointly with the model coefficients and its benefit in terms of linearization improvement is demonstrated through measurements on a Doherty power amplifier. Second, a reduced-complexity approach with negligible performance loss is proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7736161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2614974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7736161/07726033.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"911","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2614974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Segmentation for Piecewise RF Power Amplifier Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Segmentation for Piecewise RF Power Amplifier Models","volume":"26","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7726033/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16442994","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Segmentation for Piecewise RF Power Amplifier Models","sourcePdf":"lmwc-magesacher-2614974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036018S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7736161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7736161","articleId":"7726033","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7726034,"authors":[{"name":"Zeeshan Qamar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and the Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7726034/qamar-2614932-small.gif","p":["Zeeshan Qamar (S\u201911) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

In this work, a procedure that is able to estimate the RUL of equipment directly from sensor values without the need for estimating degradation states or a failure threshold is developed. A direct relation between sensor values or health indicators is modeled using a support vector regression. Using this procedure, the RUL can be estimated at any time instant of the degradation process. In addition, an offline wrapper variable selection is applied before training the prediction model. This step has a positive impact on the accuracy of the prediction while reducing the computational time compared to existing indirect RUL prediction methods. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, the Turbofan dataset, widely considered in the literature, is used. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive with other existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2623260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7849237/07726039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2623260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849237","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Remaining Useful Life Estimation Based on Support Vector Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Remaining Useful Life Estimation Based on Support Vector Regression","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16668372","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7726039/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FEDER"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Remaining Useful Life Estimation Based on Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"tie-khelif-2623260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084936S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7849237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"7849237","articleId":"7726039","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7726049,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7862955/7726049/su-2616905-small.gif","p":["Fang Su received the B.S. degree from the Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University, China, in 2015 and is working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Electronic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University.","His current research interests include low-power and energy harvesting systems using emerging nonvolatile memory for IoT applications.

The overall performance of an NVP is determined by its sleep and wake-up speeds, which refer to how fast the NVP can turn itself off and on when a sudden power failure occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to improve the system-level sleep/wake-up speed of an energy harvesting NVP. A hybrid CMOS/ferroelectric nonvolatile flipflop (nvFF) and a high-speed voltage detector are designed and integrated in the proposed NVP to jointly minimize its sleep and wake-up time. Measurement results demonstrate 46 \u03bcs wake-up time and 14 \u03bcs sleep time, which is up to 18 and 24 times speedup over existing works. This approach not only improves the robustness of the NVP to power fluctuations but also brings significant advantages for better utilization of harvested energy.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2616905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2616905","startPage":"596","endPage":"607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7862955/07726049.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ferroelectric Nonvolatile Processor with 46 $\\mu $ s System-Level Wake-up Time and 14 $\\mu $ s Sleep Time for Energy Harvesting Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Ferroelectric Nonvolatile Processor with 46 $\\mu $ s System-Level Wake-up Time and 14 $\\mu $ s Sleep Time for Energy Harvesting Applications","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16706750","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7726049/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61674094 and 61271269"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chip and High-Tech Research and Development (863) Program","grantNumber":"2013AA013201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ferroelectric Nonvolatile Processor with 46 $\\mu $ s System-Level Wake-up Time and 14 $\\mu $ s Sleep Time for Energy Harvesting Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liu-2616905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08308S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7862955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7862955","articleId":"7726049","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726050,"authors":[{"name":"Rishi Relan","affiliation":["ELEC Department, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Relan","orcid":"0000-0002-1498-5053","id":"37085382866"},{"name":"Yousef Firouz","affiliation":["MOBI Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Firouz","id":"37085349008"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Timmermans","affiliation":["MOBI Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Timmermans","id":"37561059000"},{"name":"Johan Schoukens","affiliation":["ELEC Department, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Schoukens","id":"37273870900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"7726050","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Analytical models","Integrated circuit modeling","Hidden Markov models","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","linear systems","lithium compounds","nonlinear control systems","secondary cells","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven nonlinear identification","Li-Ion battery","frequency domain nonparametric analysis","power density","energy storage","hybrid vehicles","electric vehicles","data-driven polynomial nonlinear state-space model","linear regimes","nonlinear regimes","battery electrical operation","nonparametric frequency domain characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Input\u2013output response","lithium ion (Li-ion) battery","nonlinear system identification","nonparametric characterization","polynomial nonlinear state space (PNLSS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726050","abstract":"Lithium ion batteries are attracting significant and growing interest, because their high energy and high power density render them an excellent option for energy storage, particularly in hybrid and electric vehicles.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis for multi-antenna transmissions in a multi-tier downlink HCN. We first propose a reliability-oriented threshold-based mobile association policy, where each user connects to the strongest base station from which this user can obtain the largest truncated long-term received power. Under our mobile association policy, we derive analytical expressions for the exact outage probability of an arbitrary randomly located user, along with computationally convenient lower and upper bounds. Asymptotic analysis on the outage probability shows that introducing a large access threshold into mobile association significantly decreases the outage probability. We further investigate the spectrum efficiency and the energy efficiency of the HCN. Our theoretic analysis and numerical validations show that both the spectrum and energy efficiencies can be improved by properly choosing the access threshold.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07726062.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Antenna Transmission in Downlink Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Under A Threshold-Based Mobile Association Policy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Antenna Transmission in Downlink Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Under A Threshold-Based Mobile Association Policy","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726062/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598297","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726062/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A708"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Foundation for the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671364"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents Support Fund of China","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0458"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Support Fund of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-01"},{"fundingName":"MEST 2015R1A2A1A05000977, NRF, Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Antenna Transmission in Downlink Heterogeneous Cellular Networks Under A Threshold-Based Mobile Association Policy","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zheng-2623300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218126S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7726062","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726065,"authors":[{"name":"Yongzheng Xu","affiliation":["School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7956367/7726065/xu-2617202-small.gif","p":["Yongzheng Xu received the B.S. degree in automobile engineering and the M.S. degree in transportation engineering from Shandong University of Technology in 2006 and 2012, respectively.

The original V-J method is sensitive to objects' in-plane rotation, and therefore has difficulties in detecting vehicles with unknown orientations in UAV images. To address this issue, this research proposes a road orientation adjustment method, which rotates each UAV image once so that the roads and on-road vehicles on rotated images will be aligned with the horizontal direction and the V-J vehicle detector. Then, the original V-J can be directly applied to achieve better efficiency and accuracy. The enhanced V-J method is further applied for vehicle tracking. Testing results show that both vehicle detection and tracking methods are competitive compared with other existing methods. Future research will focus on expanding the current methods to detect other transport modes, such as buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726065/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969449","volume":"18","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Viola-Jones Vehicle Detection Method From Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Imagery","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51278021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Viola-Jones Vehicle Detection Method From Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Imagery","sourcePdf":"tits-yu-2617202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152284S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7726065","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7726067,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, U.K.","College of Computer Science and Technology, Guizhou University, Guiyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8069036/7726067/hu-2592969-small.gif","p":["Bin Hu received the B.Eng. degree from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2000, and the M.Eng. degree from Guizhou University, Guiyang, China, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Computer Science and Technology.","He has been a Research Assistant with the Computational Intelligence Laboratory, University of Lincoln, U.K., where he was involved in biological visual neural network.

In biological vision systems, scientists have found that specific types of visual neurons have specific preferences to each of the three motion elements. There are computational models on translation and expansion/contraction perceptions; however, little has been done in the past to create computational models for rotational motion perception. To fill this gap, we proposed a neural network that utilizes a specific spatiotemporal arrangement of asymmetric lateral inhibited direction selective neural networks (DSNNs) for rotational motion perception. The proposed neural network consists of two parts-presynaptic and postsynaptic parts. In the presynaptic part, there are a number of lateral inhibited DSNNs to extract directional visual cues. In the postsynaptic part, similar to the arrangement of the directional columns in the cerebral cortex, these direction selective neurons are arranged in a cyclic order to perceive rotational motion cues. In the postsynaptic network, the delayed excitation from each direction selective neuron is multiplied by the gathered excitation from this neuron and its unilateral counterparts depending on which rotation, clockwise (cw) or counter-cw (ccw), to perceive. Systematic experiments under various conditions and settings have been carried out and validated the robustness and reliability of the proposed neural network in detecting cw or ccw rotational motion. This research is a critical step further toward dynamic visual information processing.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2592969","startPage":"2803","endPage":"2821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2592969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8069036","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8069036/07726067.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Rotational Motion Perception Neural Network Based on Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Visual Information Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726067/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Rotational Motion Perception Neural Network Based on Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Visual Information Processing","volume":"28","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7726067/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17260079","pubMedId":"27831890","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"EU Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"EYE2E/269118, HAZCEPT/318907 and LIVCODE/295151"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61563009"},{"fundingName":"Horizon 2020 Project","grantNumber":"STEP2DYNA/691154"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Rotational Motion Perception Neural Network Based on Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Visual Information Processing","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yue-2592969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230686S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8069036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8069036","articleId":"7726067","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7726068,"authors":[{"name":"Oluyemi Omomukuyo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Oluyemi","lastName":"Omomukuyo","orcid":"0000-0002-0260-1788","id":"37085455927"},{"name":"Deyuan Chang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Deyuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085460756"},{"name":"Octavia Dobre","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Octavia","lastName":"Dobre","id":"37085453480"},{"name":"Ramachandran Venkatesan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Ramachandran","lastName":"Venkatesan","id":"38359790700"},{"name":"Telex M.

The synchronization is achieved by using the same training symbols (TSs) employed for training-aided channel estimation (TA-CE), thereby avoiding additional training overhead. The proposed algorithm is designed for polarization division multiplexing (PDM) RGI-CO-OFDM systems that use the Alamouti-type polarization-time coding for TA-CE. Due to their optimal TA-CE performance, Golay complementary sequences have been used as the TS in the proposed algorithm. The frame synchronization is accomplished by exploiting the cross correlation between the received TS from the two orthogonal polarizations. The arrangement of the TS is also used to estimate the carrier frequency offset. Simulation results of a PDM RGI-CO-OFDM system operating at 238.1-Gb/s data rate (197.6 Gb/s after coding), with a total overhead of 9.2% (31.6% after coding), show that the proposed scheme has accurate synchronization, and is robust to linear fiber impairments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7741041/07726068.pdf","startPage":"2783","endPage":"2786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2016.2623322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2016.2623322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7741041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Frame and Frequency Synchronization Based on Alamouti Coding for RGI-CO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","OFDM","Optical fibers","Optical polarization","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Golay codes","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical fibre polarisation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization","reduced-guard-interval coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","training-aided channel estimation","polarization division multiplexing RGI-CO-OFDM systems","Alamouti-type polarization-time coding","Golay complementary sequences","training symbols","robust frame synchronization","orthogonal polarizations","carrier frequency offset estimation","data rate","linear fiber impairments","bit rate 238.1 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM)","optical fiber communication","polarization division multiplexing (PDM)","synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust Frame and Frequency Synchronization Based on Alamouti Coding for RGI-CO-OFDM","volume":"28","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7726068/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"16448528","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004952","fundingName":"Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency"},{"fundingName":"Research and Development Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Frame and Frequency Synchronization Based on Alamouti Coding for RGI-CO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"lpt-omomukuyo-2623322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082498S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7741041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7741041","articleId":"7726068","onlineDate":"31 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7726109,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Modern Economics & Management College, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085445702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2535-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2534-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2536-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726109","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Resource management","Computational modeling","Pricing","Heuristic algorithms","Computers","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","commerce","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing resource allocation model","information growth","cloud resource management","online resource convergence","combinatorial double auction mechanism","resource utilization","CDA-CCRA model","cloud computing environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","combinatorial double auction","linear programming"]}],"abstract":"As the rate of information growth intensifies, so has the study of cloud resource management because cloud computing can generate powerful online resource convergence.

Existing algorithms on imbalanced data classification processed data without putting enough attention on the positive boundary samples which were prone to misclassification, and the cost that the positive samples were misclassified is much larger than the cost that the negative samples were misclassified. Based on this background, this paper presented a new imbalanced data classification approach based on boundary samples named Boundary-Boost. At first, categorize positive sample as boundary sample and security sample. Then, synthesize the new positive samples according to the boundary sample to balance the imbalanced data. At the same time, classified all the samples by using Boosting. Next, deleted the synthesized samples which were misclassified to reduce the influence of synthesized error samples on the classification results. Experimental result shows that the approach of Boundary-Boost has advantages on imbalanced data classification problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.51","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726148.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Imbalanced Data Classification Method Driven by Boundary Samples-Boundary-Boost","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Imbalanced Data Classification Method Driven by Boundary Samples-Boundary-Boost","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726148/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430529","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Imbalanced Data Classification Method Driven by Boundary Samples-Boundary-Boost","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2535a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057834S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605059","isNumber":"7726096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605059","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726096","articleId":"7726148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7726188,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Yao","id":"37085894428"},{"name":"Li Chuyi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chuyi","id":"37085888253"},{"name":"Hu Dan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Dan","id":"37723754700"},{"name":"Yu Weiyu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Weiyu","id":"37297461100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2535-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2534-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2536-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726188","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":844},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726188","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Kernel","Object recognition","Training","Machine learning","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","image texture","natural scenes","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor feature based convolutional neural network","object recognition","natural scene","feature extraction","image classification","deep neural networks","Gabor filters","texture information learning","Gabor-CNN","ImageNet10 dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gabor","object recognition","CNN","SIFT"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.91","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726188.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","startPage":"386","endPage":"390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor Feature Based Convolutional Neural Network for Object Recognition in Natural Scene","abstract":"Feature extraction and classification are two important components in object recognition.

However, the performance of neural network language models strongly depends on their architectural structure. Three competing concepts have been developed: Firstly, feed forward neural networks representing an n-gram approach, Secondly, recurrent neural networks that may learn context dependencies spanning more than a fixed number of predecessor words, Thirdly, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks can fully exploits the correlation on a telephone conversation corpus. In this paper, we compare count models to feed forward, recurrent, and LSTM neural network in conversational telephone speech recognition tasks. Furthermore, we put forward a language model estimation method introduced the information of history sentences. We evaluate the models in terms of perplexity and word error rate, experimentally validating the strong correlation of the two quantities, which we find to hold regardless of the underlying type of the language model. The experimental results show that the performance of LSTM neural network language model is optimal in n-best lists re-score. Compared to the first pass decoding, the relative decline in average word error rate is 4.3% when using ten candidate results to re-score in conversational telephone speech recognition tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.195","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726292.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"898","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Various Neural Network Language Models in Speech Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Various Neural Network Language Models in Speech Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16447247","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726292/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Various Neural Network Language Models in Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2535a894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076928S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605059","isNumber":"7726096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605059","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726096","articleId":"7726292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726326,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Feng Ma","affiliation":["Engineering College of Armed Police Force, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Feng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085895428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2535-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2534-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2536-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726326","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuels","Fault diagnosis","Diesel engines","Instruments","Oils","Software","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diesel engines","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","fuel systems","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets","pressure sensors","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diesel engine fuel injector fault diagnosis","LABVIEW","virtual instrument technology","artificial neural network","fuel pressure wave","high pressure oil pipe","series connection type pressure sensor","fuel pressure fluctuation","diesel engine high pressure fuel pipe","fault feature extraction","injector nondisintegration diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Labview","Pressure wave","Fault feature","Fault diagnosis","Neural network"]}],"abstract":"The theory of virtual instrument technology and artificial neural network are combined in this paper, The fuel pressure wave in the high pressure oil pipe is measured by the series connection type pressure sensor, The characteristics of fuel pressure fluctuation in high pressure fuel pipe of diesel engine are analyzed after extracting the fault feature, The typical faults of the fuel injector are simulated on the 4135 diesel engine.

For reducing the cost of time and space, it need to select a subset of the training set. The samples locating near the boundary of the data distribution has more information than that locating within the data distribution. For searching the samples locating near the boundary of the data distribution, fixed neighborhood sphere sample selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Generally, the sample locating within the data distribution has more neighbors in a fixed neighborhood sphere than that locating near the boundary of the data distribution. The samples locating near the boundary of the data distribution can be reserved by counting the number of the neighbors in as fixed neighborhood sphere. The time complexity of naive fixed neighborhood sphere sample selection algorithm is O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).

The usage of LLL lattice reduction can significantly improve the performance of zero-forcing and successive interference cancellation decoders in MIMO communications. But for conventional single channel transmission, when the data streams go through poor channel condition, it usually need higher transmission signal noise ratio(SNR) at transmit side to overcome the poor condition and guarantee better receiving performance at receive side. This may be a challenge for designing transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce a multi-path transmission scheme based on LLL algorithm that transmits the same bit streams for multiple times. By means of applying LLL detection and hard decision majority-logic decoding to the multi-channel streams of data, the final detection results will reach a lower bit error rate (BER) level at the same SNR. So it needs lower transmit power compared to original single channel transmission. Performance gain will be obtained by this multi-path transmission and majority-logic decoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Lattice Reduction Algorithm Based on Majority-Logic Decoding for MIMO System","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.262","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726359.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Lattice Reduction Algorithm Based on Majority-Logic Decoding for MIMO System","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726359/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430545","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Lattice Reduction Algorithm Based on Majority-Logic Decoding for MIMO System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2535b226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048239S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605059","isNumber":"7726096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605059","xplore-issue":"7726096","articleId":"7726359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726371,"authors":[{"name":"Yunhe Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information & Mechanical Electrical, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing, China"],"firstName":"Yunhe","lastName":"Li","id":"38579257300"},{"name":"Haitao Wu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information & Mechanical Electrical, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085647501"},{"name":"Shaohua Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shaohua","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407118000"},{"name":"Jian Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37864144200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2535-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2534-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2536-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726371","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Noise measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Reconstruction algorithms","Analytical models","Compressed sensing","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian distribution","quantisation (signal)","signal sampling","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing framework","impulse radio ultra-wideband system","quantization noise","low-speed IR-UWB signal sampling process","compression measurement","Gaussian distribution","overload uniform quantization","nonuniform quantization","overload nonuniform quantization","optimization scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing (CS)","Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB)","and Quantization noise","and Overload Interval Factor (OIF)"]}],"abstract":"In order to decrease the impact of quantization noise in the low-speed sampling process of IR-UWB (impulse radio ultra-wideband) signal under the compressed sensing framework, based on the equal carry information of compression measurements and characteristics of Gaussian distribution, the paper designs three valid improved quantization mechanisms: overload uniform quantization, non-uniform quantization, and overload non-uniform quantization.

Therefore, the self-interference cancellation in digital domain is essential to take the CCFD system into practical. A cancellation method based on least mean square Volterra (LMS-Volterra) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can suppress the residual nonlinear self-interference in digital domain. The digital nonlinear self-interference cancellation model via the Volterra-series and LMS filter is built. Moreover, the detailed formulation of this cancellation procedure is derived. The expression of interference cancellation ratio (ICR) is achieved. This cancellation method can estimate the self-interference channel and suppress the residual nonlinear interference without the pilot sequence.

However, with the number of antennas and iteration times increasing, performance of F-LLL gradually becomes unsatisfactory. It will cause much performance loss especially in large MIMO system. In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm which inserts a pre-judging procedure and combines both fix method and round method is proposed. The pre-judging procedure firstly searches all the size reduction pairs to calculate all the possible values. Then analyze these values by making histogram. Fitting curve of this histogram will be presented as Gaussian distribution that mean value and standard deviation will be determined. The iteration criterion is settled equals to standard deviation. Hybrid F-LLL algorithm makes a better trade-off between algorithm complexity and performance. Also it can solve the problem of large performance loss in F-LLL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Pre-judging Fix-LLL Lattice Reduction Algorithm for MIMO Detection","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.285","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726382.pdf","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Pre-judging Fix-LLL Lattice Reduction Algorithm for MIMO Detection","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726382/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16447265","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Pre-judging Fix-LLL Lattice Reduction Algorithm for MIMO Detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2535b337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046445S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605059","isNumber":"7726096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605059","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726096","articleId":"7726382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726385,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Feng","affiliation":["National Telecommunication Metrology Station, CAICT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Feng","id":"37089088549"},{"name":"Zhang Rui","affiliation":["National Telecommunication Metrology Station, CAICT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Rui","id":"38275238800"},{"name":"Cheng Kai","affiliation":["National Telecommunication Metrology Station, CAICT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Kai","id":"37085343773"},{"name":"Zhang Pei-Yan","affiliation":["National Telecommunication Metrology Station, CAICT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Pei-Yan","id":"37085894027"},{"name":"Liu Jian-Zhe","affiliation":["National Telecommunication Metrology Station, CAICT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Jian-Zhe","id":"37085889419"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2535-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-2534-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2536-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726385","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Time-domain analysis","Distortion measurement","Power system harmonics","Oscilloscopes","Distortion","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oscilloscopes","radiofrequency power amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier waveform distortion","high sampling rate oscilloscope","continuous wave","modulation signal","RF PA","RF power amplifier","power sweep CW generation","time domain model","quadrature modulation signal","fundamental frequency","fitting function","PA output Frequency spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","Time domain","Carrier","Distortion","Measurement","Oscilloscope"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, high sampling rate oscilloscope is used for measuring the carrier waveform distortion of CW(Continuous Waves) and modulation signal that passed RF PA(Power Amplifier).

ZF can simplify the CoMP transmission problem, but the number of serviced users is limited by the number of antennas of all the coordinated base stations (BS). Without ZF constraints, more users can be serviced at the same time. In order to solve the problem efficiently, the information rate is first approximated using Taylor expansion. Then, maximizing the sum of information rates is transformed into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can work better when the number of the users is close to the total number of antennas of the base stations.","doi":"10.1109/ICISCE.2016.311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726096","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1461","pdfPath":"/iel7/7605059/7726096/07726408.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 3rd International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICISCE.2016.311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter Optimization of Coordinated Multipoint Transmission without Zero-Forcing Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information rates","Array signal processing","Downlink","Interference","Approximation algorithms","Convex functions","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave transmission","mathematical programming","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter optimization","zero-forcing constraints","downlink coordinated multipoint transmission","information rate","Taylor expansion","semidefinite programming problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CoMP","Zero-Forcing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Optimization of Coordinated Multipoint Transmission without Zero-Forcing Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726408/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726408/","accessionNumber":"16447190","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter Optimization of Coordinated Multipoint Transmission without Zero-Forcing Constraints","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2535b457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065476S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7605059","isNumber":"7726096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7605059","xplore-issue":"7726096","articleId":"7726408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726600,"authors":[{"name":"Fatima Zahra Tazi","affiliation":["Ecole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Fatima Zahra","lastName":"Tazi","id":"37085480925"},{"name":"Claude Thibeault","affiliation":["Ecole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Thibeault","id":"37085436183"},{"name":"Yvon Savaria","affiliation":["Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Savaria","id":"37085905454"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726600","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detailed analysis of radiation-induced delays on I/O blocks of an SRAM-based FPGA","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze through analytical and experimental means the impact of different SEU induced mechanisms modifying delays in I/O blocks of SRAM-based FPGAs.

(CSS) with limited time resources in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The frame structures for sensing and data transmission, if the spectrum is identified as vacant, are both assumed fixed. This implies that the time resource dedicated for CSS is limited and shared between spectrum sensing time and results reporting time, which depends on the number of sensing users. We consider an optimization problem containing network constraints on time resources for secondary users (SUs) which cooperate with each other using a weighted fusion rule. It is assumed that the SUs are in energy-surplus regime and a predefined constraint on probability of collision is satisfied to protect the cooperative network performance. We analytically prove the convexity of the optimization problem to ensure obtainability of a global solution. Analytical results, in addition to simulation results, are provided to prove the claims.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726603/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16443987","publicationDate":"May 2016","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726603/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of probability of error in collaborative spectrum sensing of time-limited cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of probability of error in collaborative spectrum sensing of time-limited cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570240983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052905S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726604,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Cognitive Radio users or secondary users (SUs) should enter the licensed channels only when the primary users (PUs) are absent. They also have to release the licensed channel whenever a primary user occupies the channel, in order to limit the interference to the primary users. Managing the spectrum access of the cognitive users is the main rule of the medium access control (MAC) layer. Due to the time varying channel availability this introduces a nontrivial number of design challenges to the MAC layer (e.g. multichannel hidden terminal problem, SUs synchronization, and achieving high throughput with limiting interference to the PUs). In this paper a new MAC protocol for ad hoc networks, named ACAP-MAC protocol, has been proposed based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) forecasting technique. The proposed protocol provides a reliable forecast for the off state time of the primary users to be opportunistically utilized by secondary users. The OPNET Modeler network simulation tool is used as a powerful tool to collect and show statistics that verify the reliability of the proposed MAC protocol. The simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol offers high throughput and low collision rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726604/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16429334","publicationDate":"May 2016","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726604/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic multi-channel MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic multi-channel MAC protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062741S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726605,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Badawy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Qatar University","Politecnico di Torino, DET"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Badawy","id":"38108336300"},{"name":"Tarek Elfouly","affiliation":["Computer Science and Computer Engineering, Qatar University"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Elfouly","id":"37063463200"},{"name":"Tamer Khattab","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Qatar University"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37282020000"},{"name":"Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, DET"],"firstName":"Carla-Fabiana","lastName":"Chiasserini","id":"37275293800"},{"name":"Daniele Trinchero","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, DET"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Trinchero","id":"37296446100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726605","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726605","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrices","Interference","Correlation","High definition video","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex cognitive radio networks","radiofrequency domains","RF domains","baseband domains","residual self interference","self interference cancellation techniques","eigenvalue based spectrum sensing techniques","covariance matrix","decision statistics","correlation coefficient matrix based algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum sensing","eigenvalues","correlation matrix","cognitive radios","Full duplex","residual self interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726605","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726605.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of eigenvalue based spectrum sensing in full-duplex cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a key component in any cognitive radio network.

The controller design is based on a dynamic model of the UAV and regulates the vehicle's relative pose to a planar visual target. The proposed approach uses a virtual camera which has zero roll and pitch motion. The IBVS image features are defined in the virtual camera image plane. Since the image feature error is stabilized in the virtual camera, the visual target can leave the real camera's field of view (FoV). To keep the visual target in the camera FoV, the proposed method bounds roll and pitch to sufficiently small prescribed values. A numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the controller's performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726618/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443947","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic image-based visual servoing for unmanned aerial vehicles with bounded inputs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic image-based visual servoing for unmanned aerial vehicles with bounded inputs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051715S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7726624,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed A.

Timely diagnosis of BCC is an important factor in the prognosis of the disease. A key to BCC diagnosis are vascular structures of the lesion. Detection and recognition of cutaneous vasculature provide critical information on diagnosis accuracy and assessment precision. In this paper, we present an effective method to extract vascular information towards lesion diagnosis. Given a dermoscopy image, we first segment vascular structures of the lesion by decomposing the image using independent component analysis into melanin and hemoglobin components and further applying shape filters at different scales. A vessel mask is generated as a result of global thresholding. A set of vascular features are then extracted from the final vessel image of the lesion and fed into a Random Forest classifier. The method demonstrates performance of 90.3% in terms of AUC in differentiating BCC from benign lesions.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726666","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726666.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic detection of basal cell carcinoma using vascular-extracted features from dermoscopy images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726666/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic detection of basal cell carcinoma using vascular-extracted features from dermoscopy images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16429267","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726666/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic detection of basal cell carcinoma using vascular-extracted features from dermoscopy images","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570244461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054884S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726678,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulfattah Noorwali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdulfattah","lastName":"Noorwali","id":"37089145226"},{"name":"Abdulbaset Hamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdulbaset","lastName":"Hamed","id":"37085359535"},{"name":"Raveendra Rao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Raveendra","lastName":"Rao","id":"37281258500"},{"name":"Abdallah Shami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdallah","lastName":"Shami","id":"37276195300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726678","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726678","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Interference","Fading channels","Smart grids","Time division multiple access","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","interference (signal)","multi-access systems","Nakagami channels","numerical analysis","smart power grids","telecommunication channels","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay analysis","wireless HAN","fading channels","multiple access schemes","interference","smart grids","electrical devices","home area network","frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access","channel capacities","Nakagami fading channels","Rayleigh fading channels","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","inter-channel interference range","TDMA","FDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HAN","Fading Distribution","FDMA","PCF","Rayleigh distribution","Nakagami distribution","Scheduling","Smart Grid","TDMA","Inter-channel Interference"]}],"abstract":"Smart grids are comprised of several interconnected layers of networks.

For these models, channel capacities over the Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels are determined and delay analysis is presented. Upper and lower bound expressions for achievable delay, in closed-form, are derived as a function of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), received power, number of EDs, number of channels, and Inter-channel Interference Range (ICR).

In this work, we propose a new despeckling method for SAR images in the wavelet domain.

It has been shown that the vector-based hidden Markov model (HMM) is capable of capturing the subband marginal distribution and the inter-scale and cross orientation dependencies of the wavelet coefficients. In view of this, in order to estimate a speckle-free SAR image, the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator using the vector-based HMM as a prior for the wavelet coefficients of images is developed by using the real and synthetically-speckled SAR images. The performance of the proposed despeckling method is evaluated and shown to be superior to some of the existing techniques in terms of providing better preservation of the details and yielding better visual quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR image despeckling using vector-based hidden Markov model in wavelet domain","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726704","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"SAR image despeckling using vector-based hidden Markov model in wavelet domain","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726704/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16443914","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR image despeckling using vector-based hidden Markov model in wavelet domain","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075828S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726711,"authors":[{"name":"Jagath Samarabandu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Jagath","lastName":"Samarabandu","id":"37377558200"},{"name":"Kamal Ranaweera","affiliation":["Arts Resource Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Ranaweera","id":"37085900166"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726711","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Image segmentation","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image sequences","object detection","video streaming","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing algorithms","optimization based techniques","image analysis","object detection","video streams","information extraction","knowledge-augmented genetic algorithms","automatically generated processing sequences","video surveillance analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726711","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726711.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing surveillance videos using automatically generated processing sequences with knowledge-augmented genetic algorithms","abstract":"Extracting meaningful information from large number of video streams require designing specific algorithms to detect each type of object such as faces, people, vehicles, bags etc. The development of such specific algorithms requires a large amount of time from an expert in image analysis. Optimization based techniques have been increasingly used to automatically develop such algorithms, but they do not utilize any domain knowledge. Consequently, these automated approaches explore a large solution space and were only able to use a small number of primitive tools as building blocks in the generated algorithms. We proposes a novel method which integrates abstract knowledge about image processing tools into a genetic algorithm by exploiting the fact that there are classes of image processing algorithms that implement specific categories of algorithms such as noise reduction, sharpening, edge detection, binarization, classification etc. Using such knowledge, we were able to constrain the search performed by the genetic algorithm within a rich space of possibly successful processing sequences. Moreover, the use of abstract knowledge decouples the proposed method from implementation details of specific processing tools so that the system can be easily extended by incorporating additional tools. Experimental evaluations compare the our approach with a traditional genetic algorithm based implementation which does not utilize highlevel knowledge. A case study shows that the proposed method could converge to the optimum solution six times faster than the traditional method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726711/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726711/","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analyzing surveillance videos using automatically generated processing sequences with knowledge-augmented genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing surveillance videos using automatically generated processing sequences with knowledge-augmented genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570250901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050486S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726718,"authors":[{"name":"Changeez Amini","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Changeez","lastName":"Amini","id":"37085888323"},{"name":"Abbas Taherpour","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Taherpour","id":"38290153600"},{"name":"Tamer Khattab","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37282020000"},{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Gazor","id":"37273433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726718","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Reactive power","Radio frequency","Channel models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor navigation","optical communication","synchronisation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["theoretical accuracy analysis","indoor visible light communication positioning system","time-of-arrival","indoor environment","indoor channel model","TOA","distance estimation","synchronization","transmitter","receiver","Cramer Rao lower bound","CRLB","radiofrequency channel","RF channel","VLC channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved channel model and estimation for positioning in indoor environments using the visible light is presented. For positioning, the specific propagation and indoor channel model for visible light is used and a time-of-arrival (TOA) based distance estimations are proposed for two cases of known and unknown transmitter and receiver vertical distance. Based on this model and also assuming perfect synchronization between transmitter and receiver, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is computed as the theoretical limits on the performance and accuracy of any unbiased estimator. Unlike the radio frequency (RF) channel, the visible light communication (VLC) channel depends on the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Calculations show that proposed channel model and positioning result to more accurate distance estimate compared to their counterparts and the corresponding CRLB is almost 100 times lower than what was previously supposed.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726718","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726718.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726718","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical accuracy analysis of indoor visible light communication positioning system based on time-of-arrival","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical accuracy analysis of indoor visible light communication positioning system based on time-of-arrival","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726718/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16443972","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical accuracy analysis of indoor visible light communication positioning system based on time-of-arrival","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570240805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073511S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726722,"authors":[{"name":"Kanza Azhar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engg & Tech, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kanza","lastName":"Azhar","id":"37085555610"},{"name":"Fiza Murtaza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engg & Tech, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Fiza","lastName":"Murtaza","id":"37085687022"},{"name":"Muhammad Haroon Yousaf","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engg & Tech, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Haroon","lastName":"Yousaf","id":"38196241800"},{"name":"Hafiz Adnan Habib","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engg & Tech, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hafiz Adnan","lastName":"Habib","id":"37839651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726722","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2058},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Asphalt","Feature extraction","Shape","Computer vision","Roads","Surface morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asphalt","Bayes methods","civil engineering computing","computer vision","graph theory","image classification","roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","pothole detection","pothole localization","asphalt pavement images","asphalt pavement distresses","roads","highways","appearance-shape based nature","histograms of oriented gradients features","HOG features","feature training","feature classification","na\u00efve Bayes classifier","pothole image detection","normalized graph cut segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","pothole detection","histogram of oriented gradient","graph-cut segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Asphalt pavement distresses have significant importance in roads and highways.

In the downlink channel, we assume that users obtain an efficient information on the channel state, with the aid of pilot sequences transmitted by BS, to decode the data signals. It is assumed that there is a channel reciprocity between the downlink channel and uplink channel in time-division duplex mode. In this case, users first transmit a pilot sequence to BS, then BS estimates the CSI and precede beamforming training sequences for users. Each user uses minimum mean-square error channel estimation to obtain the estimation of the effective channel gains. Then, users receive the data signal from BS in the rest of the channel coherence time. A lower bound on the capacity is derived in the downlink channel to evaluate the spectral efficiency when BS employs maximum ratio transmission precoding. We also propose a new method of power allocation among the pilot sequences and data signals during a length of coherence time of channel in order to maximize the spectral efficiency for a given total energy budget. The benefits of the optimal power allocation method is verified by the results obtained through simulation. It is shown that more data signal power should be used at high signal-to-noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for massive MU-MIMO downlink TDD systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726729","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for massive MU-MIMO downlink TDD systems","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726729/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16443986","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for massive MU-MIMO downlink TDD systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058595S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726739,"authors":[{"name":"Marijana \u0106osovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, East Sarajevo Bosnia, Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Marijana","lastName":"\u0106osovi\u0107","id":"37085567429"},{"name":"Slobodan Obradovi\u00f3","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, East Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Slobodan","lastName":"Obradovi\u00f3"},{"name":"Ljiljana Trajkovi\u0107","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Ljiljana","lastName":"Trajkovi\u0107","id":"37371674500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726739","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Internet","Data models","Power system faults","Power system restoration","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data analysis","internetworking","learning (artificial intelligence)","network servers","protocols","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BGP datasets","anomalous event classification","border gateway protocol","Internet robustness","network reachability information","routing information base","RIB","machine learning algorithms","malicious attacks","power outage event","traffic anomalies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BGP","machine learning","classification","malicious attacks","misconfigurations","power outage"]}],"abstract":"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which enables Internet interconnectivity, is susceptible to various anomalous events that may affect the Internet performance.

Results are verified by comparing RTL simulations and the state transition of the proposed model with other similar models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726743","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726743","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726743.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726743/","displayDocTitle":"A cellular automata based Izhikevich neuron model","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16429371","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726743/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cellular automata based Izhikevich neuron model","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570244361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064814S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726751,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Hanif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hanif","id":"37086641029"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"},{"name":"Gary Boudreau","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada Inc., Canada"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Boudreau","id":"38364857200"},{"name":"Edward Sich","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada Inc., Canada"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Sich","id":"38098795400"},{"name":"Hossein Seyedmehdi","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada Inc., Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Seyedmehdi","id":"37085719090"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726751","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":748},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Precoding","Phased arrays","Computer architecture","Array signal processing","Phase shifters","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid precoding","multiuser massive MIMO systems","sequential-EGT","best-user EGT","equal gain transmission","analog beamforming","analog phased-array","zero-forcing beamforming","interuser interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equal-gain transmission","hybrid precoding","spectral efficiency","sub-connected architecture","zero-forcing beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Massive MIMO systems bring manifold improvements in the system spectral efficiency but result in high hardware and processing complexity at the base station. Employing hybrid precoding at the base station can reduce such complexity. This paper proposes two hybrid precoding schemes for a multi-user massive MIMO system. The proposed schemes, namely sequential-EGT and best-user EGT schemes, use equal gain transmission (EGT) based analog beamforming to reap the diversity benefit of an analog phased-array and employ zero-forcing beamforming for nullifying inter-user interference. As illustrated by the simulation results presented in this paper, the best-user EGT scheme outperforms sequential-EGT scheme in all scenarios with slightly higher computational complexity. We also investigate the optimal number of scheduled users for each scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726751","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726751.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical hybrid precoding for multi-user massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726751/","displayDocTitle":"Practical hybrid precoding for multi-user massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16429306","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726751/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical hybrid precoding for multi-user massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570244417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069656S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726752,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Khalil","affiliation":["Qatar University"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Khalil","id":"38520832900"},{"name":"Tamer Khattab","affiliation":["Qatar University"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Khattab","id":"37282020000"},{"name":"Amr El-Keyi","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"El-Keyi","id":"38275224400"},{"name":"Mohammed \u00d1afie","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Cairo, Egypt","Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"\u00d1afie","id":"37268935400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726752","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-user MIMO interference channel","degree of freedom","asymmetric DoF region","K user channel","channel coefficients"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726752","abstract":"In this paper, the K-user MIMO interference channel is considered.

It strives to create an interference-free environment for the primary user by cancelation of the secondary users' signals. The optimization objective is to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the primary user through the transmit beamformers of all users and the receive beamformer of the primary user. Finding the maximum achievable SINR corresponds to maximization of the largest eigenvalue of a constrained Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix. This problem is not a convex optimization, however the upper bound, derived from the interference-free case, is known. Evolutionary algorithms are deployed for finding the beamformer solutions. In the maximum achievable SINR, the secondary users do not have beamformers at their multi-antenna receivers but instead use quasi-maximum-likelihood detection based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The prioritized weighted mean-square-error (PWMSE) formulation is also presented. The maximum achievable SINR solution outperforms the PWMSE in the error rate, and its feedback rate is lower because it requires only partial channel knowledge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming for MIMO cognitive radio with single primary and multiple secondary users","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726753","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726753.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for MIMO cognitive radio with single primary and multiple secondary users","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726753/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16444049","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for MIMO cognitive radio with single primary and multiple secondary users","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570244909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046425S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726754,"authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth M.

This paper proposes a new approach based on a critical clearing time (CCT) constraint that replaces the dynamic and transient stability constraints of the TSC-OPF problem. The CCT is computed by a multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) trained using Gauss-Newton approximation for Bayesian regularization. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of generated points in the input space to train the neural networks, a Sobol quasi-random sequence is adopted for data generation. The proposed method has the merit of removing the computational burden of dynamic simulation during optimisation. Multi-contingency can simply be handled by adding a CCT constraint for each contingency. Simulation results for the New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that TSC-OPF using MFNN has very fast convergence to optimal operating points with the desired CCT.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726774","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726774.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-contingency transient stability-constrained optimal power flow using multilayer feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-contingency transient stability-constrained optimal power flow using multilayer feedforward neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16444014","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726774/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-contingency transient stability-constrained optimal power flow using multilayer feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118825S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7726775,"authors":[{"name":"Emammer Shafter","affiliation":["Innovation Centre for Information Engineering (ICIE), The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Emammer","lastName":"Shafter","id":"37085722675"},{"name":"Raveendra K.

Various subclasses of CPM mapper such as single-h CPFSK, multi-h CPFSK, and asymmetric multi-h CPFSK are also considered. Next, these mappers in conjunction with Clipping and Filtering (CF) technique are considered and it is shown that repeated clipping and frequency domain filtering in OFDM systems can significantly reduce the PAPR of the transmitted signal. The technique causes no increase in out-of-band power and significant PAPR reduction can be achieved with only moderate levels of clipping. A comparison of PAPR reduction capability of CPM mappers relative to memoryless BPSK mappers in an OFDM system is presented.

The third generation (3G) standards employ orthogonal variable spreading factor-wideband code division multiple access (OVSF-WCDMA) technologies which flexibly support mixed and variable data rate services. The orthogonal property of OVSF codes leads to code blocking which further gives call blocking. This paper proposed a new allocation model by adding multiple subcarriers in the same OVSF code tree structure. The aim of using multiple subcarriers is to reduce the internal and external fragmentation of an OVSF code tree. Several common single code assignment strategies, namely, random, left-most and crowded-first code are used. The simulation results show significant increase in the code tree utilization and reduction in the code blocking probability.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726776","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726776.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-subcarrier OVSF code allocation in WCDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-subcarrier OVSF code allocation in WCDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726776/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16443920","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726776/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-subcarrier OVSF code allocation in WCDMA","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043018S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7726780,"authors":[{"name":"Hala As'ad","affiliation":["University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Hala","lastName":"As'ad"},{"name":"Martin Bouchard","affiliation":["University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bouchard"},{"name":"Homayoun Kamkar-Parsi","affiliation":["Sivantos Group, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Homayoun","lastName":"Kamkar-Parsi","id":"37085901128"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726780","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Array signal processing","Conferences","Handheld computers","Hearing aids","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","hearing aids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptually motivated binaural beamforming","hearing aids","noise reduction","binaural noise cues preservation","directional noise sources","diffuse-like background noise","recorded signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hearing Aids","Cues Preservations","Noise Reduction","Binaural Beamforming"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, a new binaural beamforming algorithm for hearing aids is introduced in order to generate binaural outputs with a good trade-off between noise reduction and binaural noise cues preservation.

The selection and mixing are done with a classification algorithm based on the complex coherence between the standard beamformer outputs and other available signals.

In this paper, a novel offloading algorithm called `Dynamic Programming with Hamming Distance Termination' (denoted DPH) is presented. Our algorithm uses randomization and a hamming distance termination criterion to find a nearly optimal offloading solution quickly. The algorithm will offload as many tasks as possible to the cloud when the network transmission bandwidth is high, thereby improving the total execution time of all tasks and minimizing the energy use of the mobile device. The algorithm can find very good solutions with low computational overhead. A novel and innovative approach to fill the dynamic programming table is used to avoid unnecessary computations, resulting in lower computation times compared to other schemes. Furthermore, the algorithm is extensible to handle larger offloading problems without a loss of computational efficiency. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed DPH algorithm can achieve near minimal energy while meeting an application's execution time constraints, and it can find a nearly optimal offloading decision within a few iterations.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726790","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726790.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic programming offloading algorithm for mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726790/","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic programming offloading algorithm for mobile cloud computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726790/","publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16429269","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic programming offloading algorithm for mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156298S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726793,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Alsharif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Alsharif","id":"37713209400"},{"name":"Khalid Aldubaikhy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Aldubaikhy","id":"37085889252"},{"name":"Xuemin Sherman Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Xuemin Sherman","lastName":"Shen","id":"37065811100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Roads","Estimation","Routing","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","neural nets","radio links","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network routing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based mobility prediction","intervehicle link duration","vehicular ad hoc network","VANET","information transmission","next-hop selection optimization","position-based routing","PBR","vehicular mobility pattern","NN based mobility prediction scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726793","abstract":"The knowledge of Inter-vehicle link duration is an important parameter in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), as it is useful for vehicles to delay their information transmission if link breakage is anticipated before completing the transmission. In addition, it plays a pivotal role in routing, as it allows proactive construction of long-life paths, and optimizing next-hop selection in position-based routing (PBR). However, due to the high mobility of vehicles and the complicated vehicular mobility patterns in urban areas, the estimation of link duration in urban VANETs is still an open research issue. Different from other complex link duration estimation methods, we introduce a lightweight neural networks (NNs) based mobility prediction scheme which allows vehicles to autonomously predict their future mobility speed for a certain time window. Then, the expected speed is used in an urban area mobility prediction model to estimate link duration between neighbouring vehicles. Extensive simulation results are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726793","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726793.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link duration estimation using neural networks based mobility prediction in vehicular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Link duration estimation using neural networks based mobility prediction in vehicular networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429288","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726793/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link duration estimation using neural networks based mobility prediction in vehicular networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057436S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7726832,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

The hardware parallelism can take the form of multi-core central processing units (CPUs), massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs), and, most recently, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabrics. OpenCL compilers for CPUs and GPUs have been available for over 6 years, but only recently has compiler support been extended to include FPGAs. This paper investigates OpenCL designs for the computationally demanding standard iterative decoding algorithm for low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC decoding algorithm offers several kinds of potentially exploitable parallelism. Our objective was to investigate the design trade-offs in OpenCL that will produce the best performance when compiled by the Altera Offline Compiler (AOC v15.1) for OpenCL-to-FPGA. Within a relatively short design time we were able to implement a decoder that achieved 5.12 Mbps with a length-1024 (3,6)-regular code.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726832","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726832.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of decoders for symmetric low density parity check codes on parallel computation platforms using OpenCL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726832/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of decoders for symmetric low density parity check codes on parallel computation platforms using OpenCL","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429259","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726832/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of decoders for symmetric low density parity check codes on parallel computation platforms using OpenCL","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049203S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7726836,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham Mahrous","affiliation":["UBC-ECE Department, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"Mahrous","id":"37085904652"},{"name":"Rabab Ward","affiliation":["UBC-ECE Department, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Rabab","lastName":"Ward","id":"37272152500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726836","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Dictionaries","Wavelet transforms","Band-pass filters","Sensors","Compressed sensing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","compressed sensing","dictionaries","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","power consumption","signal reconstruction","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power Dirac basis compressed sensing framework","EEG","Meyer wavelet function dictionary","electroencephalography transmission","sensor node","wireless body area networks","WBAN","sensor battery size","power consumption","CS","signal reconstruction","random sampling circuit","Dirac sensing matrix","signal recovery","basis dictionary","multiple band-pass Meyer wavelet","optimal sparse basis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG Signals","WBAN","Compressed Sensing","Meyer Wavelet","Sparse Signal"]}],"abstract":"The energy required for Electroencephalography (EEG) transmission at the sensor node, in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), is high relative to the sensor's battery size. The power consumption is dominated by sensing, processing and data transmission of the EEG. Many successful solutions based on Compressed Sensing (CS) and other techniques have been proposed. The transmission of a lower number of bits elongates the battery life of the sensor but results in high errors in the reconstructed signals at the receiver side. In this paper, we use CS to reduce the energy at the sensor. We also acquire the signal using a random sampling circuit (simulating a Dirac sensing matrix) which eliminates the use of a microcontroller at the sensor node. At the receiver end, we propose to recover the signal using a basis dictionary, which has a multiple band-pass Meyer wavelet. This is shown to result in low signal recovery error. The proposed dictionary promotes optimal sparse basis and optimal incoherence with the Dirac sensing Matrix. The proposed technique is shown to achieve low decompression errors at high compression rates such as 10:1. It also achieves ultra-low power consumption as the Meyer wavelet is incoherent with the random Dirac basis used for sampling. We show an analysis that indicates significant power consumption reduction.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726836","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726836.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power Dirac basis compressed sensing framework for EEG using a Meyer wavelet function dictionary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726836/","displayDocTitle":"A low power Dirac basis compressed sensing framework for EEG using a Meyer wavelet function dictionary","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16444000","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726836/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power Dirac basis compressed sensing framework for EEG using a Meyer wavelet function dictionary","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10064S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726848,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Biran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Biran","id":"37085898033"},{"name":"Pooya Sobhe Bidari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Pooya Sobhe","lastName":"Bidari","id":"37871137900"},{"name":"Ahmed Almazroa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Almazroa","id":"37085628674"},{"name":"Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Vasudevan","lastName":"Lakshminarayanan","id":"37540563400"},{"name":"Kaamran Raahemifar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Kaamran","lastName":"Raahemifar","id":"37085551513"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8722-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726848","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handheld computers","Decision support systems","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","diseases","eye","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image filtering","medical image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retinal image","2D Gabor wavelet transform","local entropy thresholding","alternative sequential filter","retinal blood vessel extraction","eye disease detection","diabetic retinopathy","blindness","image processing technique","fundus image","2D Gabor filter","Structured Analysis of the Retina","STARE database","Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction","DRIVE database","Matlab code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fundus images","Fundus photography","Blood vessels extraction","Wavelet transform","Gabor filter","Diabetic retinopathy"]}],"abstract":"Retinal blood vessels extraction is a primary step for detecting eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy which causes blindness.

Food image recognition has been attracting increasing attention due to the advances of Internet, imaging techniques and social media. Approaches for food image recognition are mainly focused on two main directions: low-level approaches and mid-level approaches. Low-level approaches extract low-level local features, such as SIFT or SURF, following feature encoding techniques. Mid-level approaches extract higher-level image parts and have shown promising results in many recognition problems. Compared with other image recognition problems, food images are highly deformable with large intra-class variance and small between-class variance. In this paper, considering that mid-level approaches' superior performance and superpixels segmentation methods' ability to successfully segment food parts, we propose a superpixel-based food image recognition framework to mine mid-level superpixel food parts-to-class similarity. We evaluate the proposed framework on UEC Food dataset, and show promising results when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726860","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589833/7726593/07726860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726593","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superpixel-based image recognition for food images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Superpixel-based image recognition for food images","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726860/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16429349","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7726860/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superpixel-based image recognition for food images","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570241223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103113S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589833","isNumber":"7726593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589833","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726593","articleId":"7726860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726876,"authors":[{"name":"K C Sriharipriya","affiliation":["Kingston Engineering College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"K C","lastName":"Sriharipriya"},{"name":"P C Preethi","affiliation":["Kingston Engineering College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"P C","lastName":"Preethi"},{"name":"K Baskaran","affiliation":["Government College of Technology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Baskaran"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7807-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7808-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7726876","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Cognitive radio","Energy efficiency","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Quality of service","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","optimisation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean energy efficiency","cognitive radio channels","wireless communication systems","mean EE maximization problem","secondary user","primary user","Dinkelbach algorithm","exhaustive search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","energy efficiency","outage constraint","fading channels"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of mean energy efficiency in cognitive radio channels","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07726876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726876","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726876","abstract":"Obtaining Energy Efficiency (EE) is very difficult for wireless communication systems especially for cognitive radio network (CRN).

Thus the problem is solved at a low complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429538","htmlLink":"/document/7726876/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of mean energy efficiency in cognitive radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of mean energy efficiency in cognitive radio channels","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042135S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7726876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726889,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The monitoring of fetus ECG(FECG) is important to monitor the baby inside mom abdomen. The observation during labour and delivery is done by monitoring fetus heart rate(FHR). It is also useful in biomedical telemetry and telemedicine. The abdominal electrocardiogram(AECG) consist of FECG as well as maternal electrocardiogram(MECG). The amplitude of FECG is very less in compare to MECG. So its difficult to separate. In this paper we use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for transmission from remote area with high signal to noise ratio(SNR). Wavelet transforms (WT) and artificial intelligence systems is used to de-noise composite signal and to obtain FCEG from AECG. Coding is done in MATLAB software. The artificial neural network and fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) is used to get exact F-ECG at desired location.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07726970.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of fetal electrocardiogram through ofdm, neuro-fuzzy logic and wavelets systems for telemetry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","OFDM","Wavelet transforms","Monitoring","Fetus","Abdomen"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","biomedical telemetry","electrocardiography","fuzzy logic","fuzzy reasoning","medical signal processing","neural nets","obstetrics","OFDM modulation","patient monitoring","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fetal electrocardiogram detection","neuro-fuzzy logic","wavelet systems","medical monitoring","heart electrical activity","fetus ECG monitoring","fetus heart rate","biomedical telemetry","telemedicine","abdominal electrocardiogram","AECG","maternal electrocardiogram","MECG","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","wavelet transforms","artificial intelligence systems","composite signal denoising","MATLAB software","artificial neural network","fuzzy inference system","ANFIS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Telemetry","OFDM","ECG","A-ECG","F-ECG","Fuzzy logic","Membership function","Wavelet transform","M-ECG and Neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detection of fetal electrocardiogram through ofdm, neuro-fuzzy logic and wavelets systems for telemetry","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726970/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429559","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of fetal electrocardiogram through ofdm, neuro-fuzzy logic and wavelets systems for telemetry","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046179S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7726970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7726979,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In look up table (LUT) system, the more interconnections are increasingly the dominant contributor to delay, area, and energy consumption in CMOS digital circuits. In existing system would require four QLUTs to properly implement this function, two QLUTs for each output, that is sum and carry out, working with the two possible values of the carry in. This method will have signal propagation delay and hence its decrease the speed of the circuit and more power is consumed. In order to overcome this problem multiple-valued logic is used, it can decrease the average power required for level transitions and reduces the number of required interconnections and also reducing the impact of interconnections on overall energy consumption.

Spectral analysis using the Fourier Transform is a powerful technique for stationary time series where the characteristics of the signal do not change with time. For non-stationary time series like modulated signals, the spectral content changes with time and hence time-averaged amplitude spectrum found by using Fourier Transform is inadequate to track the changes in the signal magnitude, frequency or phase. The FSWT is an extension of short time Fourier Transform in the frequency domain and is based on a moving and scalable localizing modified Gaussian window. This transform has some desirable characteristics that are absent in the earlier wavelet transform. The Frequency Slice Wavelet Transform is unique in that it provides frequency - dependant resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum. Several non-stationary synthetic and practical power signals are taken for analysis using both frequency slice wavelet transform and wavelet transforms to prove the superiority of the former over the later.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals using frequency slice wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726999","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07726999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7726999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7726999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7726999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals using frequency slice wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7726999/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429400","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals using frequency slice wavelet transform","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043551S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7726999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727010,"authors":[{"name":"Jayant P.

This can be possible by means of digital signal processing. So, in SDR receiver, received analog Radio Frequency (RF) signal is converted to digital signal by an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) just after the receiving antenna. Digital signal coming out from ADC has a fixed sample rate. This sample rate should be converted to another sample rate, according to different wireless standards. This technique is known as Sample Rate Conversion (SRC). This is done for making the digital signal suitable for baseband processing. This paper discusses different techniques to perform SRC and their implementations. This paper also highlights roles of filters in SRC technique and some important constraints to be maintained while designing these filters. Finally it focuses on three types of filters suitable for SRC and mentions some of their advantages and disadvantages.","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727029","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07727029.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample rate conversion technique for software defined radio receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sample rate conversion technique for software defined radio receiver","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727029/","accessionNumber":"16429500","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727029/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample rate conversion technique for software defined radio receiver","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046649S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7727029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727043,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It's no more a costlier affair, as most of the handheld electronic gadgets such as mobile phones are equipped with digital cameras. Today, there are ample PC and mobile apps available which are developed to manipulate captured photographs. One can easily take a picture, manipulate it with the installed app and make it viral through the internet. Hence, these digital photographs should not be interpreted as they speak. Digital images are the good proof of events and places. Hence, these digital photographs can be presented as evidence before a court of law. It becomes very important in such cases then, to prove the digital photographs in question to be original. Digital image forensics plays a vital role in such circumstances. Digital image forensics is a branch of digital forensics which deals with examining the digital photographs for their integrity and authenticity. In this paper, we present a digital image forensic method which can detect one of such image tampering. As images can be tampered in a number of ways, in this paper, we address a common case called as copy-paste tampering. Our proposed method is robust to affine transform; especially to rotation and scaling.","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727045","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07727045.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital image forensics: An affine transform robust copy-paste tampering detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Digital image forensics: An affine transform robust copy-paste tampering detection","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727045/","accessionNumber":"16429537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727045/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital image forensics: An affine transform robust copy-paste tampering detection","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051528S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7727045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727053,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Usman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia","Jaypee University of Information Technology (JUIT), Solan, India"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Usman","id":"37085896690"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7807-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7808-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7727053","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Decoding","Wireless communication","Rayleigh channels","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","concatenated codes","convolutional codes","Rayleigh channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated convolution-polar codes","Rayleigh channels","symmetric binary erasure channels","wireless channel","inner convolution code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polar codes","channel polarization","symmetric binary channels","convolution codes","degraded channels"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated convolution-polar codes over Rayleigh channels degraded as erasure channels","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07727053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727053","abstract":"Polar codes have been shown to approach capacity of symmetric binary erasure channels.

The penetration of distributed generation leads to violating the relay coordination in the distribution network. The interconnection of DG affects miscoordination of distribution system protection, because of the generator ability to contribute large fault currents to the fault point. The impact of DG on relay coordination affect the operating time of relay. The CTI associated with primary and backup relay pairs is getting violated due to changes in fault current level. Thus, coordination between primary and backup relays fails in the presence of distributed Generation. Hence, the interconnection of DG in the distribution system causes an adverse impact on protection coordination. Relay coordination problem has many constraints due to coordination criteria. Heuristic based optimization techniques are used to solve the optimization problems. These techniques have a drawback of converging to the values that may not be optimum due to the wide range of design variables and difficulty in getting an initial feasible solution with a short range of design variables. This paper presents a new algorithm to overcome the problem of the initial feasible solution in determining the optimum settings of OCRs. In this context, the optimization problem is formulated as constrained non-linear optimization problem and is determining using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

Traditional telecom network operators perform traffic control flow (forwarding and filtering of packets), but in Mobile Edge Computing, cloud servers are also deployed in each base station. Therefore, network operator has a great responsibility in serving mobile subscribers. Mobile Edge Computing platform reduces network latency by enabling computation and storage capacity at the edge network. It also enables application developers and content providers to serve context-aware services (such as collaborative computing) by using real time radio access network information. Mobile and Internet of Things devices perform computation offloading for compute intensive applications, such as image processing, mobile gaming, to leverage the Mobile Edge Computing services. In this paper, some of the promising real time Mobile Edge Computing application scenarios are discussed. Later on, a state-of-the-art research efforts on Mobile Edge Computing domain is presented. The paper also presents taxonomy of Mobile Edge Computing, describing key attributes. Finally, open research challenges in successful deployment of Mobile Edge Computing are identified and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727082","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07727082.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey on mobile edge computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A survey on mobile edge computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727082/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429545","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727082/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on mobile edge computing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079843S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"325","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7727082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727087,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Cognitive radio is a new paradigm of designing wireless communications systems which aims to enhance the utilization of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum for wireless communications. Available spectrum bands may vary with different cognitive radio users. It happens when the transmission range of cognitive radio users is larger than or similar to that of primary user. Then different cognitive radio users may obtain different sensing results since they are at different locations and different impacts on primary user systems. In order to establish this challenging adaptation, cooperative relay channel has been introduced in a network to enhance the end to end throughput in terms of power and bandwidth constraints. The proposed cooperative relay diversity method employs three sorts of parallel end-to-end transmission scenarios comprising of direct, dual-hop, and relay diversity transmission. Therefore, the overall end-to-end communication has been achieved by the use of three kinds of channels occupying four spectrum bands. The total throughput is obtained by the summation of three kinds of transmission since multiple transmissions may happen simultaneously in cognitive radio relay channel (CRRC). Performance metrics such as throughput in terms of power and channel constraints has been analyzed. Simulation has been carried out using MATLAB R2009b.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727087/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16429539","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727087/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximization of end to end throughput of cognitive radio network using cooperative relay channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximization of end to end throughput of cognitive radio network using cooperative relay channels","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050663S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7727087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727088,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In fixed spectrum assignments there are many frequencies that are not being properly used. So Cognitive radio is a technology that supports a secondary and opportunistic access to licensed spectrum shows great potential to dramatically improve spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing performed by secondary users to detect unoccupied spectrum bands is a key enabling technique for cognitive radio. However, the sensing time could be still unacceptably long due to the weak PU signal, particularly in non-Gaussian noise. The goal of this project is to improve the spectrum sensing efficiency, by means of sequential sensing scheme based on Suprathreshold Stochastic Resonance (SSR). The performance metrics such as false alarm rate, detection probability, average sample number (ASN) has been considered for analysis. The technique has been analyzed using MATLAB R2010a simulation tool.","doi":"10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727088","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589934/7726872/07727088.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCO.2016.7727088","publicationTitle":"2016 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential spectrum sensing approach based on suprathreshold stochastic resonance in cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sequential spectrum sensing approach based on suprathreshold stochastic resonance in cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727088/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727088/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429442","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential spectrum sensing approach based on suprathreshold stochastic resonance in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077533S","chronDate":"7-8 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589934","isNumber":"7726872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589934","xplore-issue":"7726872","articleId":"7727088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727123,"authors":[{"name":"Nikhil Angad Bakshi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Nikhil Angad","lastName":"Bakshi","id":"37085901926"},{"name":"Raghu Ramachandran","affiliation":["Navstik Autonomous Systems, Pune, Maharashtra, India"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Ramachandran","id":"37085898573"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7807-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7808-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7727123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Neural networks","Adaptive control","Cost function","Aerodynamics","Training","Propellers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","backpropagation","helicopters","mobile robots","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indirect model reference adaptive control","quadrotor UAVs","artificial neural network","ANN based controller","trajectory tracking","dynamically modeled thrust coefficients","dynamically modeled drag coefficients","plant emulator ANN","backpropagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadrotor","UAV","Neural Networks","Online Learning","MRAC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727123","abstract":"In this paper we propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based controller for a quadrotor UAV.

A benchmark database is used to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method, using as objective function the minimization of the error of recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727191","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727191.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A firefly algorithm for modular granular neural networks optimization applied to iris recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Training","Computer architecture","Multi-layer neural network","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["granular computing","iris recognition","neural net architecture","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["firefly algorithm","modular granular neural networks optimization","iris recognition","firefly optimization","optimal MNN architecture","human recognition","iris biometrics","error minimization","granular computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular Neural Networks","Firefly Algorithm","Iris Recognition","Human Recognition","Optimization","Granular Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A firefly algorithm for modular granular neural networks optimization applied to iris recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727191/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446638","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A firefly algorithm for modular granular neural networks optimization applied to iris recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-019-N-16158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063701S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727192,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine D.

Using Arduino Pro Mini microprocessors and a flexible data communication framework that makes use of the built-in circuit bus called the Inter-Integrated Circuit, this implementation involves the programming of one neuron per microchip. This one to one ratio allows for the computational parallelism inherent in neural networks and provides for the flexibility of building various ANN architectures. The prototype that was developed consists of an input layer element microchip, two hidden layer neuron microchips, and an output layer neuron microchip. Learning happens completely on hardware via backpropagation without a data connection to a computer. Tests showed that the prototype can learn the logical operations OR, AND, XOR, and XNOR, and that the system can accommodate dynamic changes in learning between logical operations.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727200","startPage":"206","endPage":"212","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks

In spite of the good results, it is still not clear why these networks achieve such good recognition rates. One way to learn more about deep neural networks is to visualise and understand what they are learning, and to do so techniques such as deconvolution could play a significant role. In this paper, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Lateral Inhibition Pyramidal Neural Network (LIPNet) to learn facial expressions. Then, we use the deconvolution process to visualise the learned features of the CNN and we introduce a novel mechanism for visualising the internal representation of the LIPNet. We perform a series of experiments, training our networks with the Cohn-Kanade data set and show what kind of facial structures compose the learned emotion expression representation. Then, we use the trained networks to recognise images from the Jaffe data set and demonstrate that the learned representations are present in different face images, emphasizing the generalization aspects of these networks. We discuss the different representations that each network learns and how they differ from each other. We also discuss how each learned representation contributes to the recognition process and how they can be compared to the emotional notation Facial Action Coding System - Facs. Finally, we explain how the principles of invariance, redundancy and filtering, common for deep networks, contribute to the learned features and to the facial expression recognition task in general.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727203.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding how deep neural networks learn face expressions","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Understanding how deep neural networks learn face expressions","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446427","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727203/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding how deep neural networks learn face expressions","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-031-N-16621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074907S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727205,"authors":[{"name":"Rotem Golan","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Rotem","lastName":"Golan","id":"37085896874"},{"name":"Christian Jacob","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37338720100"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Denzinger","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CA"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Denzinger"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727205","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2223},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","Computed tomography","Cancer","Image databases","Biological neural networks","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cancer","computerised tomography","feature extraction","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection","patient diagnosis","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lung nodule detection","deep convolutional neural networks","thoracic computed tomography scans","lung cancer treatment","lung cancer diagnosis","screening technology","image data","computer-aided detection system","CADe systems","thoracic CT images","lung image database consortium database","LIDC database","image database resource initiative database","IDRI database","deep convolutional neural network","CNN","backpropagation algorithm","valuable volumetric feature extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727205.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lung nodule detection in CT images using deep convolutional neural networks","abstract":"Early detection of lung nodules in thoracic Computed Tomography (CT) scans is of great importance for the successful diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Due to improvements in screening technologies, and an increased demand for their use, radiologists are required to analyze an ever increasing amount of image data, which can affect the quality of their diagnoses. Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) systems are designed to assist radiologists in this endeavor. Here, we present a CADe system for the detection of lung nodules in thoracic CT images. Our system is based on (1) the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI) database, which contains 1018 thoracic CT scans with nodules of different shape and size, and (2) a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained, using the back-propagation algorithm, to extract valuable volumetric features from the input data and detect lung nodules in sub-volumes of CT images. Considering only those test nodules that have been annotated by four radiologists, our CADe system achieves a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 78.9% with 20 false positives (FPs) per scan, or a sensitivity of 71.2% with 10 FPs per scan. This is achieved without using any segmentation or additional FP reduction procedures, both of which are commonly used in other CADe systems. Furthermore, our CADe system is validated on a larger number of lung nodules compared to other studies, which increases the variation in their appearance, and therefore, makes their detection by a CADe system more challenging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446607","htmlLink":"/document/7727205/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lung nodule detection in CT images using deep convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lung nodule detection in CT images using deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-033-N-16717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071659S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727206,"authors":[{"name":"Guillermo Cabrera-Vives","affiliation":["AURA Observatory in Chile","Center for Mathematical Modeling, Universidad de Chile, Chile"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Cabrera-Vives","id":"37085886155"},{"name":"Ignacio Reyes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Chile, Chile"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Reyes","id":"37085884287"},{"name":"Francisco F\u00f6rster","affiliation":["Millennium Institute of Astrophysics, Chile","Center for Mathematical Modeling, Universidad de Chile, Chile"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"F\u00f6rster","id":"37085891713"},{"name":"Pablo A.

This has been primarily driven by large survey instruments, which scan large areas of the sky aiming to catalog everything they find. The High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) is one of these surveys that searches for phenomena of limited duration (such as supernovae) called transients. The HiTS pipeline produces transient candidates by subtracting science images from a template. In this paper we present a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) approach to classify sources found in the difference images as real transients or artifacts. We compare our results against a random forest classification model that has been created by the HiTS team during the last two years through feature engineering. Our ConvNet model obtains features automatically and obtains a 99.32% accuracy as compared to the previous 98.89% accuracy from the random forest model. This approach will be very useful when processing data from next generation instruments such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727206","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","startPage":"251","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supernovae detection by using convolutional neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supernovae detection by using convolutional neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727206/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446479","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supernovae detection by using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-034-N-26038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136066S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727207,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel S.

Convolutional Neural Networks are the state-of-the-art method for supervised image classification, borrowing concepts from image processing in order to ensure some degree of scale and position invariance. They are capable of detecting primary features, which are then combined by subsequent layers of the CNN architecture, resulting in the detection of higher-order complex and relevant novel features. Considering that a video is a set of ordered images in time, we propose in this paper to explore CNNs in the context of movie trailers genre classification. Our contributions are twofold. First, we have developed a novel movie trailers dataset with more than 3500 trailers whose genres are known, and we make it publicly available for the interested reader. Second, we detail a novel classification method that encapsulates a CNN architecture to perform movie trailer genre classification, namely CNN-MoTion, and we compare it with state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques for movie classification such as Gist, CENTRIST, w-CENTRIST, and low-level feature extraction. Results show that our novel method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727207","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727207.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"266","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Movie genre classification with Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Movie genre classification with Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446464","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727207/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Movie genre classification with Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-035-N-17114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081453S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727208,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Eisenbach","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Neuroinformatics and Cognitive Robotics Lab, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Eisenbach","id":"37318406900"},{"name":"Daniel Seichter","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Neuroinformatics and Cognitive Robotics Lab, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Seichter","id":"37085814238"},{"name":"Tim Wengefeld","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Neuroinformatics and Cognitive Robotics Lab, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Wengefeld","id":"37085449849"},{"name":"Horst-Michael Gross","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Neuroinformatics and Cognitive Robotics Lab, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Horst-Michael","lastName":"Gross","id":"37085615201"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727208","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","image resolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative multiscale convolutional neural networks","person detection","computer vision applications","multiresolution model","deep learning techniques","nonmaximum suppression","Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark"]}],"abstract":"Robust person detection is required by many computer vision applications.

The networks learn features from raw pixel information, which is also rare for pedestrian detection. Due to the use of multiple Convolutional Neural Networks at different scales, the learned features are specific for far, medium, and near scales respectively, and thus, the overall performance is improved. Furthermore, we show, that neural approaches can also be applied successfully for the remaining processing steps of classification and non-maximum suppression. The evaluation on the most popular Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark shows that the proposed method can compete with state of the art methods without using Caltech training data and without fine tuning.

However, such speed cannot be achieved by traditional rate-based spiking neural network (SNN). Compared with spiking rate, the specific spiking timing (also called spiking pattern) may convey much more information. In this paper, by using modified rank order coding scheme, the generated absolute analog features have been encoded into the first spike wave with specific spatiotemporal structural information. An intuitive yet powerful feed-forward spiking neural network framework has been proposed, along with its own unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule with dynamic post-synaptic potential threshold. Compared with other state-of-art spiking algorithms, the proposed method uses biologically plausible STDP learning method to learn the selectivity while the dynamic post-synaptic potential threshold guarantees no training sample will be ignored during the learning procedure. Furthermore, unlike the complicated frameworks used in those state-of-art spiking algorithms, the proposed intuitive spiking neural network is not time-consuming and quite capable of on-line learning. A satisfactory experimental result has been achieved on classic MNIST handwritten character database.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual pattern recognition using unsupervised spike timing dependent plasticity learning","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727210","endPage":"292","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727210.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727210","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Image recognition","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","image coding","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual pattern recognition","unsupervised spike timing dependent plasticity learning","rate-based spiking neural network","spiking pattern","modified rank order coding scheme","absolute analog features","spatiotemporal structural information","feedforward spiking neural network","unsupervised STDP learning rule","dynamic post-synaptic potential threshold","biologically plausible STDP learning method","intuitive spiking neural network","online learning","MNIST handwritten character database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visual pattern recognition using unsupervised spike timing dependent plasticity learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430260","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual pattern recognition using unsupervised spike timing dependent plasticity learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-038-N-16304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067634S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7727212,"authors":[{"name":"Priyadarshini Panda","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Priyadarshini","lastName":"Panda","id":"37085624150"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727212","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Neurons","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical features","spiking deep networks","spike-based unsupervised regenerative learning scheme","SpikeCNN","object recognition problems","integrate-and-fire neurons","auto-encoder learning model","encoder-decoder principle","spike-timing information","convolutional layer","MNIST/CIFAR10 datasets","hierarchical feature representations","event-based coding"]}],"abstract":"We present a spike-based unsupervised regenerative learning scheme to train Spiking Deep Networks (SpikeCNN) for object recognition problems using biologically realistic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.

PLoS Computational Biology, 3(2), 247-257]. The original model showed that a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning algorithm embedded in an appropriately selected SCN could perform unsupervised feature discovery. The discovered features where interpretable and could effectively be used to perform rapid binary decisions in a classifier. In order to study the robustness of the previous results, the present research examines the effects of modifying some of the components of the original model. For improved biological realism, we replace the original non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with Izhikevich-like neurons. We also replace the original STDP rule with a novel rule that has a probabilistic interpretation. The probabilistic STDP slightly but significantly improves the performance for both types of model neurons. Use of the Izhikevich-like neuron was not found to improve performance although performance was still comparable to the IF neuron. This shows that the model is robust enough to handle more biologically realistic neurons. We also conclude that the underlying reasons for stable performance in the model are preserved despite the overt changes to the explicit components of the model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition of visual features through probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727213","endPage":"314","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727213.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Robustness","Neurons","Biological system modeling","Motorcycles","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual feature acquisition","probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity","feedforward five-layer spiking convolutional network","SCN","ventral visual stream","unsupervised feature discovery","classifier","Izhikevich-like neurons","probabilistic STOP","STDP learning","feature extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition of visual features through probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727213/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446281","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition of visual features through probabilistic spike-timing-dependent plasticity","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-041-N-16647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070781S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727215,"authors":[{"name":"Anil Yesilkaya","affiliation":["Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Yesilkaya","id":"37085664164"},{"name":"Onur Karatalay","affiliation":["Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Karatalay","id":"37085891697"},{"name":"Arif Selcuk Ogrenci","affiliation":["Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Arif Selcuk","lastName":"Ogrenci","id":"38656883000"},{"name":"Erdal Panayirci","affiliation":["Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panayirci","id":"37344633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727215","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":748},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727215","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","OFDM","Software","Analytical models","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","free-space optical communication","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communications","channel taps estimation","communication systems design","nonlinear characteristics","VLC channel","software simulation","channel parameter prediction","neural network training","channel tap prediction"]}],"abstract":"Visible light communications (VLC) is an emerging field in technology and research.

The choice of activation and loss functions is particularly relevant as the formulation of training procedures strongly depends on the pairing of these functions. However, the very few works on the effect of different combinations of these functions do not present a comprehensive experimental study on classification and only investigate a few pairings. This paper provides a significant empirical analysis on the selection of such pairings. Our work presents the formulations of Iterative Reweighted Least Squares for nine pairings of most common activation and loss functions. We investigated the impact of these formulations, including natural pairings, on both binary and multi-class classification in artificial and real-world datasets. Our results show that, for multi-class classification, one should select an activation and a loss function that form a natural pairing in order to generate an effective weight update rule. For binary classification, although different pairings produced statistically different mean average precisions, natural pairings were not a significant factor in the generalisation performance of a neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727216","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727216.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"333","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of pairings of activation and loss functions in neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of pairings of activation and loss functions in neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430255","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727216/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of pairings of activation and loss functions in neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-044-N-16941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078566S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727219,"authors":[{"name":"Hoon Chung","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Hoon Chung","id":"37856736400"},{"name":"Sung Joo Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Sung Joo Lee","id":"37678067900"},{"name":"Jeon Gue Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"lastName":"Jeon Gue Park","id":"37441545800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727219","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":948},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement uncertainty","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","matrix algebra","nonlinear functions","time series","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trainable activation functions","deep neural network","DNN","feedforward neural network","weight matrices","bias vectors","nonlinear activation function","error back-propagation algorithm","rectifier-type nonlinear functions","Taylor series"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes trainable activation functions for deep neural network (DNN).

Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has established itself as a powerful technique for human activity recognition, where convolution and pooling operations are applied along the temporal dimension of sensor signals. In most of existing work, 1D convolution operation is applied to individual univariate time series, while multi-sensors or multi-modality yield multivariate time series. 2D convolution and pooling operations are applied to multivariate time series, in order to capture local dependency along both temporal and spatial domains for uni-modal data, so that it achieves high performance with less number of parameters compared to 1D operation. However for multi-modal data existing CNNs with 2D operation handle different modalities in the same way, which cause interferences between characteristics from different modalities. In this paper, we present CNNs (CNN-pf and CNN-pff), especially CNN-pff, for multi-modal data. We employ both partial weight sharing and full weight sharing for our CNN models in such a way that modality-specific characteristics as well as common characteristics across modalities are learned from multi-modal (or multi-sensor) data and are eventually aggregated in upper layers. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the high performance of our CNN models, compared to state of the arts methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Accelerometers","Kernel","Sensors","Time series analysis","Gyroscopes","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","convolution","gyroscopes","neural nets","sensor fusion","signal classification","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","human activity recognition","accelerometer","gyroscope sensors","times series data classification","temporal dimension","sensor signals","1D convolution operation","univariate time series","multisensors","multimodality","2D convolution","pooling operations","multivariate time series","local dependency","temporal domain","spatial domain","unimodal data","multimodal data","CNN-pff","partial weight sharing","full weight sharing","modality-specific characteristics","multisensor data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727224","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727224","startPage":"381","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727224.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727224/","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural networks for human activity recognition using multiple accelerometer and gyroscope sensors","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446696","htmlLink":"/document/7727224/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural networks for human activity recognition using multiple accelerometer and gyroscope sensors","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-052-N-16235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069155S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7727226,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chung Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi-Chung Cheung","id":"37272961500"},{"name":"Sean Shensheng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Sean Shensheng Xu","id":"37891323800"},{"name":"Sin-Chun Ng","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, The Open University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Sin-Chun Ng","id":"37271680300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727226","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Algorithm design and analysis","Training","Performance analysis","Convergence","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local minima","learning process","multilayer feedforward neural network training","wrong output modification","WOM","performance analysis","generalization performance","early stopping method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727226","abstract":"A learning process is easily trapped into a local minimum when training multi-layer feed-forward neural networks. An algorithm called Wrong Output Modification (WOM) was proposed to help a learning process escape from local minima, but WOM still cannot totally solve the local minimum problem. Moreover, there is no performance analysis to show that the learning has a higher probability of converging to a global solution by using this algorithm. Additionally, the generalization performance of this algorithm was not investigated when the early stopping method of training is applied. Based on these limitations of WOM, we propose a new algorithm to ensure the learning can escape from local minima, and its performance is analyzed. We also test the generalization performance of this new algorithm when the early stopping method of training is applied.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727226","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727226.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"402","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systematic algorithm to escape from local minima in training feed-forward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A systematic algorithm to escape from local minima in training feed-forward neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446377","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727226/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic algorithm to escape from local minima in training feed-forward neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-054-N-16703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135689S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727228,"authors":[{"name":"Elahe Eskandari","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Elahe","lastName":"Eskandari","id":"37074022800"},{"name":"Arash Ahmadi","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37085445528"},{"name":"Shaghayegh Gomar","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Shaghayegh","lastName":"Gomar","id":"37074268000"},{"name":"Majid Ahmadi","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37085385418"},{"name":"Mehrdad Saif","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Saif","id":"37085445813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727228","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving Spiking Neural Networks of artificial creatures using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological cells","Delays","Sociology","Statistics","Biological neural networks","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolving spiking neural networks","artificial creatures","genetic algorithm based evolution framework","GA","SNN","virtual environment","randomly connected Izhikevich spiking reservoir neural networks","biological neurons","neuronal connections","axonal conduction delays","evolutionary algorithm","colony approach","single complex creature"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based evolution framework in which Spiking Neural Network (SNN) of single or a colony of artificial creatures are evolved for higher chance of survival in a virtual environment.

Their architecture is distinguished by a randomly recurrent hidden infra-structure called dynamic reservoir. Coming up with an efficient reservoir structure depends mainly on selecting the right parameters including the number of neurons and connectivity rate within it. Despite expertise and repeatedly tests, the optimal reservoir topology is hard to be determined in advance. Topology evolving can provide a potential way to define a suitable reservoir according to the problem to be modeled. This last can be mono- or multi-constrained. Throughout this paper, a mono-objective as well as a multi-objective particle swarm optimizations are applied to ESN to provide a set of optimal reservoir architectures. Both accuracy and complexity of the network are considered as objectives to be optimized during the evolution process. These approaches are tested on various benchmarks such as NARMA and Lorenz time series.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727232","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727232.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"447","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization of reservoir structure in Echo State Network","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.c5cc4d29-9711-418e-a79f-c211218b7a40","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2018/05/31/single-and-multi-objective-particle-swarm-optimization-of-echo-state-network-architecture","name":"Single- and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization of Echo State Network architecture","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=c5cc4d29-9711-418e-a79f-c211218b7a40","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization of reservoir structure in Echo State Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446417","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727232/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization of reservoir structure in Echo State Network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-060-N-16919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100428S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727235,"authors":[{"name":"Hajer Brahmi","affiliation":["Research Groups in Intelligent Machines, National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS), Sfax 3038, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Hajer","lastName":"Brahmi","id":"37071998800"},{"name":"Boudour Ammar","affiliation":["Research Groups in Intelligent Machines, National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS), Sfax 3038, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Boudour","lastName":"Ammar","id":"37605437800"},{"name":"Adel M.

The span of past data points is important for some applications since prediction will not be possible unless the minimal timespan of the data points is available. This is a problem for cyclone wind-intensity prediction, where prediction needs to be made as a cyclone is identified. This paper presents an empirical study on minimal timespan required for robust prediction using Elman recurrent neural networks. Two different training methods are evaluated for training Elman recurrent network that includes cooperative coevolution and backpropagation-though time. They are applied to the prediction of the wind intensity in cyclones that took place in the South Pacific over past few decades. The results show that a minimal timespan is an important factor that leads to the measure of robustness in prediction performance and strategies should be taken in cases when the minimal timespan is needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727239/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446615","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727239/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of minimal timespan problem for recurrent neural networks with application to cyclone wind-intensity prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of minimal timespan problem for recurrent neural networks with application to cyclone wind-intensity prediction","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-067-N-16186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057304S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727240,"authors":[{"name":"Alok Kanti Deb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Alok Kanti","lastName":"Deb","id":"37902861000"},{"name":"Dibyendu Guha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Dibyendu","lastName":"Guha","id":"37085574367"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727240","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Kalman filters","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Estimation","Training","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","nonlinear systems","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state estimation","dynamic neural network design","single input non linear plants","Kalman filter algorithm","dynamic neural network weight training"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Neural Network","Kalman Filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727240","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727240.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"497","endPage":"502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of states of a nonlinear plant using Dynamic Neural Network and Kalman Filter","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to design a Dynamic Neural Network that can effectively estimate all the states of single input non linear plants.

Moreover, buildings have a great potential for helping to meet energy efficiency targets. Hence, energy saving goals that target buildings can have a significant contribution in reducing environmental impact. Today's smart buildings achieve energy efficiency by monitoring energy usage with the aim of detecting and diagnosing abnormal energy consumption behaviour. This research proposes a generic collective contextual anomaly detection (CCAD) framework that uses sliding window approach and integrates historic sensor data along with generated and contextual features to train an autoencoder to recognize normal consumption patterns. Subsequently, by determining a threshold that optimizes sensitivity and specificity, the framework identifies abnormal consumption behaviour. The research compares two models trained with different features using real-world data provided by Powersmiths, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727242","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","startPage":"511","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collective contextual anomaly detection framework for smart buildings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Collective contextual anomaly detection framework for smart buildings","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446515","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727242/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collective contextual anomaly detection framework for smart buildings","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-070-N-16951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060618S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727244,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, SuZhou, China"],"lastName":"Yan Yin","id":"37085897144"},{"name":"JunMin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, SuZhou, China","University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study"],"lastName":"JunMin Wu","id":"37291830700"},{"name":"HuanXin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, SuZhou, China"],"lastName":"HuanXin Zheng","id":"37085895041"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727244","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","handwritten character recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten digits recognition","convolutional neural networks","CNN","face recognition","feature maps","learnable kernel","Ncfm technique","MNIST datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ncfm","Cfm","CNNs","Handwritten Digits Recognition"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have been confirmed as a powerful technique for classification of visual inputs like handwritten digits and faces recognition. Traditional convolutional layer's input feature maps are convolved with learnable kernel then combined for achieving better performance. The biggest drawback is that the combination of feature maps can lose features and do not apply well to large-scale neural networks. In this paper, we introduce Ncfm(No combination of feature maps), a novel technique to improve the performance of CNNs. By applying Ncfm technique, the input feature maps are not combined, which implies that the number of input feature maps is equal to output feature maps. The Ncfm technique converges faster and performs better than Cfm (Combination of feature maps) with fewer filters. Through the type of feature map, experimental evaluation shows that the performance is improved and we achieve the state-of-the-art performance with 99.81% accuracy rate on the MNIST datasets.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727244","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727244.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ncfm: Accurate handwritten digits recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727244/","displayDocTitle":"Ncfm: Accurate handwritten digits recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446573","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727244/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ncfm: Accurate handwritten digits recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-072-N-16106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13627S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727246,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangsheng Li","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085896646"},{"name":"Jianhui Pang","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jianhui Pang","id":"37085893172"},{"name":"Biyun Mo","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Biyun Mo","id":"37085889097"},{"name":"Yanghui Rao","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanghui","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085635796"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727246","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Semantics","Probabilistic logic","Training","Neurons","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","emotion recognition","neural nets","social sciences computing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid neural networks","social emotion detection","short text","World Wide Web","content analysis methods","contextual information","biterm topic model","BTM","latent Dirichlet allocation","latent topic distribution","biterm generation modeling","noise reduction","supervised learning","transfer learning","conventional neural networks","initial pretraining phase","simple back-propagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Biterm Topic Model","Pre-training","Social Emotion Detection","Short Text"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727246","abstract":"Short text is prevalent on the Web, but it brings challenges to content analysis methods for the lack of contextual information. Biterm topic model (BTM) is a variant of latent Dirichlet allocation, which effectively infers the latent topic distribution of short text by modeling the generation of biterms in the whole corpus. However, it needs fine-tuning from labels to reduce noise when applied to supervised learning. Motivated by the transfer learning approach, we propose the hybrid neural networks based on BTM and conventional neural networks, which first make the hidden layer of neural networks approximate the inference of BTM. Following this initial pre-training phase, we then use the simple back-propagation algorithm to fine-tune the topic distribution learned from BTM, so as to improve the performance of supervised learning.

However, these preprocesses require strong prior knowledge and are always lossy operations. And that will lead to dropped or false extractions of minutiae. In this paper, a novel minutiae extraction approach based on deep convolutional neural networks is proposed, which directly extract minutiae on raw fingerprint images without any preprocess since we tactfully take the advantage of the strong representative capacity of deep convolutional neural networks. Minutiae can be effectively extracted due to the well designed architectures. Furthermore, the accuracy is guaranteed in that the comprehensive estimate is made to eliminate spurious minutiae. Moreover, a number of implement skills are employed both to avoid overfitting and to improve the robustness. This approach makes a good performance because it not only makes all use of information in fingerprint images but also learns the minutiae patterns from large amounts of data. Comparisons are made with previous works and a widely applied commercial fingerprint identification system. Results show that our approach performs better both in accuracy and robustness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct fingerprint minutiae extraction approach based on convolutional neural networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727251","startPage":"571","endPage":"578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727251.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A direct fingerprint minutiae extraction approach based on convolutional neural networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727251/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446792","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct fingerprint minutiae extraction approach based on convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-079-N-16050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0892S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727253,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqing Gao","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

Our experiments on a Mandarin speech recognition task show that the hybrid DNNs for joint modeling of mixed-band speech yield significant performance gains over both the narrowband and wideband speech models, well-trained separately, with a relative character error rate reduction of 7.9% and 3.9% on narrowband and wideband data, respectively.

However, the main issue of this technique is assigned to the relay misoperation during the presence of inrush currents and current transformer (CT) saturation. In the literature, these limitations have been overcome with the use of tools based on artificial intelligence and signal processing, such as the methods based on artificial neural networks and wavelet transform. This paper proposes a method based the ANNs and wavelet transform to detect and classify disturbance in the power transformer accurately. The algorithm uses wavelet-based disturbance detector in order to detect any disturbance related to a power transformer, whereas a neural network-based routine is used to classify the disturbance type (internal fault, external fault and transformer energization) appropriately, as well as to classify the internal faults. Several events were simulated, such as external and internal faults, with variations of fault resistance, fault inception angle, and fault type parameters, as well as transformer energizations. The method presented an excellent success rate regarding the correct classification of the disturbance as well as an accurate fault classification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power transformer disturbance classification based on the wavelet transform and artificial neural networks","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727260","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727260.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Power transformer disturbance classification based on the wavelet transform and artificial neural networks","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727260/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446749","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power transformer disturbance classification based on the wavelet transform and artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-088-N-17088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10366S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727261,"authors":[{"name":"Roney L. de S.

In the last 20 years many authors presented a number of techniques showing how to extract symbolic rules from Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Nevertheless, very few were related to ensembles of neural networks and even less for networks trained by deep learning. In this work the Discretized Multi Layer Perceptron (DIMLP) was trained by deep learning, then symbolic rules were extracted in an easier way with respect to standard MLPs. We compared the accuracy of deep trained DIMLPs and DIMLP ensembles on a subset of the MNIST dataset. The former networks were more accurate than the latter. Moreover, the complexity of the rules extracted from deep trained DIMLPs was similar to that obtained by boosted ensembles of DIMLPs. Finally, we examined the generated rules with respect to the centroids of the covered samples. Qualitatively, no clear difference in the strategy of classification emerged between deep trained DIMLPs and the ensembles.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727264","startPage":"668","endPage":"675","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727264.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rule extraction study on a neural network trained by deep learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727264/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A rule extraction study on a neural network trained by deep learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727264/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446489","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rule extraction study on a neural network trained by deep learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-092-N-16547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061391S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727265,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Storer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Storer","id":"37085903254"},{"name":"Robert Green","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Green","id":"37532258600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727265","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Backpropagation","Support vector machines","Particle swarm optimization","Neural networks","Error analysis","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","environmental science computing","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","wildfires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO trained neural networks","forest fire size prediction","data representation","particle swarm optimization","artificial neural network","ANN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727265","abstract":"Forest fires are a dangerous and devastating phenomenon.

In order to eliminate the hazy effect on images and improve the visual quality, this paper presents an efficient method combining the fuzzy inference system and the neural network filter to solve image dehazing. During dehazing, the fuzzy inference system is adopted to estimate the variations in light attenuation, and the erosion of morphological operation and the neural network filter are used to eliminate the halation and achieve optimization in transmission map refinement. Finally, the brightest 1% of the atmospheric light is utilized to calculate the color vector of atmospheric light to eliminate color cast.

Varying statistical properties of the signals during inter- or intra-session transfers can lead to deteriorated BCI performances over time. These variations may cause the input data distribution to shift when transitioning from the training phase (calibration session) to the testing/operating phase resulting in a covariate shift. We propose to handle this issue using a novel hybrid learning method based on two classifiers, wherein the first classifier allows including new information in the training dataset, and the second classifier performs an overall classification. The proposed method is motivated by the smoothness assumption, i.e., the points that are closest to each other are more likely to share the same label, and may be added online to enrich the training dataset. The method is evaluated on two real-world datasets corresponding to motor imagery detection (BCI competition 2008 dataset 2A and 2B). The results support the conclusion that an improvement in the classification accuracy over traditional inductive learning and semi-supervised learning methods can be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727277","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727277.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combination of transductive and inductive learning for handling non-stationarities in motor imagery classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A combination of transductive and inductive learning for handling non-stationarities in motor imagery classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727277/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446734","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combination of transductive and inductive learning for handling non-stationarities in motor imagery classification","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-105-N-16848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088344S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":7727280,"authors":[{"name":"Priscila Lima Rocha","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil"],"firstName":"Priscila Lima","lastName":"Rocha","id":"37085899070"},{"name":"Washington Luis Santos Silva","affiliation":["Federal Institute of Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Brazil"],"firstName":"Washington Luis","lastName":"Santos Silva","id":"37088387564"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727280","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Speech","Discrete cosine transforms","Training","Biological neural networks","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","discrete cosine transforms","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","multilayer perceptrons","signal classification","speech recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent system","DCT parametric models","numerical command recognition system","neural networks","multilayer perceptron","learning vector quantization","speech signal recognition","encoding","mel-cepstral coefficients","two-dimensional time matrix","discrete cosine transform","pattern classification","MLP","LVQ networks","network topology","learning algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727280","abstract":"This paper proposes the development of a Numerical Command Recognition System of Speech Signal based on Neural Networks and DCT models.

For demonstration of the performance of the proposed analysis methodology, the obtained results were compared with other methods of classification given by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727280","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727280.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"795","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent system of speech recognition using Neural Networks based on DCT parametric models of low order","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent system of speech recognition using Neural Networks based on DCT parametric models of low order","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446547","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727280/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent system of speech recognition using Neural Networks based on DCT parametric models of low order","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-108-N-16714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109188S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727284,"authors":[{"name":"Lauraine Tiogning Kueti","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon"],"firstName":"Lauraine","lastName":"Tiogning Kueti","id":"37085894312"},{"name":"Norbert Tsopze","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Tsopze","id":"38275603300"},{"name":"Cezar Mbiethieu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon"],"firstName":"Cezar","lastName":"Mbiethieu","id":"37085884872"},{"name":"Engelbert Mephu-Nguifo","affiliation":["Clermont Univcrsit\u00b4e, Univcrsit\u00b4e Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Engelbert","lastName":"Mephu-Nguifo","id":"38272004400"},{"name":"Laure Pauline Fotso","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon"],"firstName":"Laure Pauline","lastName":"Fotso","id":"37085892288"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727284","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Feedforward neural networks","Biological neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","data structures","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","Boolean factors","nonlinear problems","ANN","open research problem","black box aspect","optimal factors","data representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727284","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727284.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"819","endPage":"825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boolean factors based Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"Due to its ability to solve nonlinear problems, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) could be applied in several areas of life.

Here, we explore the integration of electrochemical metallization cell (ECM) nanodevices with tunable filamentary switching in nanoscale learning systems. Such devices offer a natural transition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP). In this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve noisy classification tasks. A single crossbar learning scheme is first introduced and evaluated. Perfect classification is possible only for simple input patterns, within critical timing parameters, and when device variability is weak. To overcome these limitations, a dual-crossbar learning system partly inspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is then introduced. This approach outperforms a conventional ELM-inspired system when the first layer is imprinted before training and testing, and especially so when variability in device timing evolution is considered: variability is therefore transformed from an issue to a feature. In attempting to classify the MNIST database under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84% classification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88% classification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92% classification. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of both systems in terms of energy, complexity, area imprint, and speed. All these results highlight that tuning and exploiting intrinsic device timing parameters may be of central interest to future bio-inspired approximate computing systems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727300","startPage":"947","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727300.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the short-term to long-term plasticity transition in memristive nanodevice learning architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727300/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the short-term to long-term plasticity transition in memristive nanodevice learning architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727300/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446451","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the short-term to long-term plasticity transition in memristive nanodevice learning architectures","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-128-N-16991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071354S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727301,"authors":[{"name":"Susmita Dey Manasi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Susmita Dey","lastName":"Manasi","id":"37085862308"},{"name":"Amit Ranjan Trivedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Amit Ranjan","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"38242152200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727301","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727301","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Logic gates","Heterojunctions","Computer architecture","Electroencephalography","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","Gaussian processes","high electron mobility transistors","medical signal processing","self-organising feature maps","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate-source-overlapped heterojunction tunnel FET-based LAMSTAR neural network","EEG signal classification","reduced complexity physical implementation","self-organizing-map","SOM","LAMSTAR","large scale memory storage and retrieval","Gaussian IDS-VGS characteristic","SO-HTFET","single transistor","digital SOM cell","IDS-VGS variance","drain-to-source voltage","electroencephalogram classification","EEG","fixed neuron","dynamic neuron approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterojunction Tunnel FET","Self-organizing-map","LAMSTAR neural network","EEG classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727301","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727301.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"955","endPage":"962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate/source-overlapped heterojunction Tunnel FET-based LAMSTAR neural network and its Application to EEG Signal Classification","abstract":"This paper explores reduced complexity physical implementation of self-organizing-map (SOM) and LAMSTAR (Large Scale Memory Storage and Retrieval) neural network.

In the past few years deep neural networks implemented on GPU clusters have become the state of the art in image classification. They provide excellent classification ability at the cost of a more complex data manipulation process. However once these systems are trained, we show that the analog crossbar circuits in this paper can highly parallelize the recognition phase of a CNN algorithm. One of the drawbacks of using memristors to carry out computations is that the data stored will likely have less precision when compared to typical 32-bit floating point memory. However, we show the proposed system is capable of operating with zero loss in classification accuracy if the memristors utilized are able to store at least 16 unique values (essentially acting as 4-bit devices). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a memristor based circuit for implementing CNN recognition. This is also the first paper that provides a circuit for precise memristor based analog convolution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727302/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727302/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446801","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Memristor crossbar deep network implementation based on a Convolutional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor crossbar deep network implementation based on a Convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-130-N-16706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136496S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7727303,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Han","id":"37085771923"},{"name":"Abhronil Sengupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Abhronil","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37085718413"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37437103900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727303","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":824},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Hardware","Computer architecture","Training","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy benefits","spiking deep neural networks","deep learning neural networks","visual processing","classification problems","artificial neural network models","biologically realistic spiking neural network","event-driven spiking neural network","deep artificial nets","neural computing platforms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727303.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the energy benefits of spiking deep neural networks: A case study","abstract":"Deep learning neural networks have achieved success in a large number of visual processing tasks and are currently utilized for many real-world applications like image search and speech recognition among others.

Over the past few years, artificial neural network models have evolved into the biologically realistic and event-driven spiking neural networks. Recent research efforts have been directed at developing mechanisms to convert traditional deep artificial nets to spiking nets where the neurons communicate by means of spikes. However, there have been limited studies providing insights on the specific power, area and energy benefits offered by deep spiking neural nets in comparison to their non-spiking counterparts.

In this paper we present an automatic graphic logo detection system that robustly handles unconstrained imaging conditions. Our approach is based on Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks (FRCN) proposed by Ross Girshick, which have shown state-of-the-art performance in several generic object recognition tasks (PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenges). In particular, we use two CNN models pretrained with the ILSVRC ImageNet dataset and we look at the selective search of windows `proposals' in the pre-processing stage and data augmentation to enhance the logo recognition rate. The novelty lies in the use of transfer learning to leverage powerful Convolutional Neural Network models trained with large-scale datasets and repurpose them in the context of graphic logo detection. Another benefit of this framework is that it allows for multiple detections of graphic logos using regions that are likely to have an object. Experimental results with the FlickrLogos-32 dataset show not only the promising performance of our developed models with respect to noise and other transformations a graphic logo can be subject to, but also its superiority over state-of-the-art systems with hand-crafted models and features.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727305","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727305.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"991","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic graphic logo detection via Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automatic graphic logo detection via Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446758","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727305/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic graphic logo detection via Fast Region-based Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-133-N-16419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080975S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7727306,"authors":[{"name":"Saikat Basu","affiliation":["Louisiana State University"],"firstName":"Saikat","lastName":"Basu","id":"37085508657"},{"name":"Manohar Karki","affiliation":["Louisiana State University"],"firstName":"Manohar","lastName":"Karki","id":"37085507662"},{"name":"Supratik Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Louisiana State University"],"firstName":"Supratik","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278558400"},{"name":"Sangram Ganguly","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Sangram","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37395359300"},{"name":"Ramakrishna Nemani","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center"],"firstName":"Ramakrishna","lastName":"Nemani","id":"38577900600"},{"name":"Robert DiBiano","affiliation":["Autopredictive Coding LLC"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"DiBiano","id":"37085513762"},{"name":"Shreekant Gayaka","affiliation":["Applied Materials"],"firstName":"Shreekant","lastName":"Gayaka","id":"37662453400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727306","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feature extraction","Error analysis","Upper bound","Mathematical model","Object recognition","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image representation","image texture","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","texture classification","image dataset classification","texture feature","class-conditional discriminative representation","feature space","textural feature extraction","Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension","low-dimensional representation","convolutional neural network","dropout network","dropconnect network","texture-based dataset","handwritten digit dataset","object recognition dataset","n-dimensional manifold","vector space dimensionality"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the use of Deep Neural Networks for the classification of image datasets where texture features are important for generating class-conditional discriminative representations.

As a corollary to this analysis, we derive for the first time upper bounds on the VC dimension of Convolutional Neural Network as well as Dropout and Dropconnect networks and the relation between excess error rate of Dropout and Dropconnect networks. The concept of intrinsic dimension is used to validate the intuition that texture-based datasets are inherently higher dimensional as compared to handwritten digits or other object recognition datasets and hence more difficult to be shattered by neural networks.

A common approach to anomaly detection is to identify outliers in a latent space learned from data. For instance, PCA has been successfully used for anomaly detection. Variational autoencoder (VAE) is a recently-developed deep generative model which has established itself as a powerful method for learning representation from data in a nonlinear way. However, the VAE does not take the temporal dependence in data into account, so it limits its applicability to time series. In this paper we combine the echo-state network, which is a simple training method for recurrent networks, with the VAE, in order to learn representation from multivariate time series data. We present an echo-state conditional variational autoencoder (ES-CVAE) and demonstrate its useful behavior in the task of anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Echo-state conditional variational autoencoder for anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727309","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727309.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Echo-state conditional variational autoencoder for anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727309/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Echo-state conditional variational autoencoder for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-137-N-17053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060736S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727312,"authors":[{"name":"Samya Bagchi","affiliation":["SBALABS Pvt.

SNNs can potentially achieve very large scale implementation and distributed learning due to the inherent asynchronous and sparse inter-neuron communications. In this work, we develop an efficient, scalable and flexible SNN simulator, which supports learning through STDP. The simulator is ideal for biologically inspired neuron models for computation but not for biologically realistic models. Bayesian neuron model for SNNs that is capable of online and fully-distributed STDP learning is introduced. The function of the simulator is validated using two networks representing two different applications from unsupervised feature extraction to inference based sentence construction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727313","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727313","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1051","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727313.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727313/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of bayesian learning and inference on distributed stochastic spiking neural networks","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16446878","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727313/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of bayesian learning and inference on distributed stochastic spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-141-N-17032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059872S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727320,"authors":[{"name":"L\u00eddio Mauro Lima de Campos","affiliation":["Prog.de Pos-Graduacao em, Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1-UFPA, Brasil"],"firstName":"L\u00eddio Mauro","lastName":"Lima de Campos","id":"37088405174"},{"name":"Roberto C\u00e9lio Lim\u00e3o de Oliveira","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Engineering, Federal University of Par\u00e1, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, PA, BR"],"firstName":"Roberto C\u00e9lio","lastName":"Lim\u00e3o de Oliveira","id":"37085778643"},{"name":"Mauro Roisenberg","affiliation":["Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina-UFSC Florian6polis, SC, Brasil"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Roisenberg","id":"37353171700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727320","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Production","Neurons","Encoding","DNA","Biological information theory","RNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","genetic algorithms","neural net architecture","recurrent neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid neuro-evolutive algorithm","neural network optimization","NEA","compact indirect encoding scheme","IES","genotypes","recurrent neural networks","genetic algorithm","GA","Lindenmayer system","neural network architecture","neural codification","scalability","search space reduction","parallel genome scan engine","implicit parallelism","economical artificial neural networks","time series forecasting","TSF","ADANN","ARIMA","UCM","Forecast Pro","decision making process"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727320","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid neuro-evolutive algorithm (NEA) that uses a compact indirect encoding scheme (IES) for representing its genotypes, moreover has the ability to reuse the genotypes and automatically build modular, hierarchical and recurrent neural networks.

Furthermore, the system uses a parallel genome scan engine that increases both the implicit parallelism and convergence of the GA. The fitness function of the NEA rewards economical artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are easily implemented. The NEA was tested on five real-world classification datasets and three well-known datasets for time series forecasting (TSF). The results are statistically compared against established state-of-the-art algorithms and various forecasting methods (ADANN, ARIMA, UCM, and Forecast Pro). In most cases, our NEA outperformed the other methods, delivering the most accurate classification and time series forecasting with the least computational effort. These superior results are attributed to the improved effectiveness and efficiency of NEA in the decision-making process.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727320","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1103","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727320.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid neuro-evolutive algorithm for neural network optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727320/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid neuro-evolutive algorithm for neural network optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727320/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446495","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid neuro-evolutive algorithm for neural network optimization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-148-N-16885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078215S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727321,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy Rawlins","affiliation":["Griffith University, Australia"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Rawlins","id":"37085729777"},{"name":"Andrew Lewis","affiliation":["Griffith University, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37265628100"},{"name":"Timoleon Kipouros","affiliation":["Integrated and Intelligent Systems, Griffith University's Institute, UK"],"firstName":"Timoleon","lastName":"Kipouros","id":"37070930700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727321","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Optimization","Decision trees","Automotive components","Law","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blackbox constraint violations repairing","multiobjective optimisation","decision trees","multi-objective optimisation","industrial problems","optimisation reduction","infeasible solutions identification","infeasible solutions repairing","three potential prerepair methods","airfoil lift/drag optimisation problem","repair methodologies","problem space","complete regeneration","underlying constraint learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727321","abstract":"A potential area of difficulty for Multi-Objective Optimisation of industrial problems is a class of problems where the majority of the objective space violates blackbox constraints. The difficult arises because potential solutions that violate blackbox constraints provide no information beyond their infeasibility. They provide neither meaningful information about their objective values nor about the degree to which the constraint is violated (or even in some cases which constraint is violated). This means that they do not help to find valid solutions (except by elimination) which, in turn, reduces the early stages of optimisation to effective guesswork until some feasible solutions are found. In this work, we attempt to reduce this problem by using a Decision Tree to identify and repair infeasible solutions by learning the underlying constraints on each parameter. We propose three potential Pre-Repair Methods and compare them on a modified case study of an airfoil lift/drag optimisation problem. Note that no optimisation was done; instead the goal was to decide if the repair methodologies were suitable in the problem space. We used two baselines: not using a Decision Tree, and only using a Decision Tree to identify potentially infeasible solutions for complete regeneration. All three of our proposed methods outperformed the baselines at a statistically significant level of confidence of 0.001.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727321","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727321.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1111","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repairing blackbox constraint violations in Multi-Objective Optimisation by use of decision trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Repairing blackbox constraint violations in Multi-Objective Optimisation by use of decision trees","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446620","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727321/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repairing blackbox constraint violations in Multi-Objective Optimisation by use of decision trees","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-149-N-16324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052099S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727323,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Vin\u0131cius Mazega Figueredo","affiliation":["PPGIA - PUCPR, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcus Vin\u0131cius Mazega","lastName":"Figueredo","id":"37397362600"},{"name":"Emerson Cabrera Paraiso","affiliation":["PPGIA - PUCPR, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Emerson Cabrera","lastName":"Paraiso","id":"37373106200"},{"name":"Julio Cesar Nievola","affiliation":["PPGIA - PUCPR, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Julio Cesar","lastName":"Nievola","id":"37402450300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727323","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727323","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Classification algorithms","Training","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","decision trees","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constructive algorithm","decision trees","evolutionary algorithms","learning algorithm","constructive neural networks","neuron layout","tree-like structure","weight optimization","evolutionary approach","multilayer perceptrons","MLP","network architecture","attribute normalized information gain","single-cell learning","particle swarm optimization","accuracy","sensitivity","specificity","precision","comprehensibility","databases","classification performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["knowledge extraction from neural networks","decision trees","evolutionary algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727323","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727323.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constructive algorithm for neural networks inspired on decision trees and evolutionary algorithms","abstract":"Inspired on decision trees and evolutionary algorithms, this paper proposes a learning algorithm of constructive neural networks that relies on three principles: to layout the neurons in a tree-like structure; to train each neuron individually; and, to optimize all the weights using an evolutionary approach.

Based on the normalized information gain of each attribute, the algorithm builds the network architecture. In the process, it automatically creates a set of training examples for each individual neuron and executes single-cell learning. Once the network is created and trained, particle swarm optimization is utilized to evolve the connections of the network. Five metrics were utilized to validate the method when compared to decision trees and MLPs: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and comprehensibility. The experiments were executed in thirteen different databases and the results suggest that the proposed algorithm can generate neural networks with good classification performance and more comprehensible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727323/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446733","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727323/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A constructive algorithm for neural networks inspired on decision trees and evolutionary algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constructive algorithm for neural networks inspired on decision trees and evolutionary algorithms","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-151-N-16571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081336S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727324,"authors":[{"name":"Miquel L.

The functionality of the present approach is demonstrated for a time-series prediction task.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727324.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1133","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic hardware implementation of Liquid State Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Reservoirs","Stochastic processes","Hardware","Biological neural networks","Encoding","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","stochastic processes","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic hardware implementation","liquid state machines","LSM methodology","recurrent spiking neural networks","SNN","time-dependent signals","stochastic computing","time-series prediction task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking Neural Networks","Recurrent Neural Networks","Liquid State Machines","Stochastic Computing","Field Programmable Gate Array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic hardware implementation of Liquid State Machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446882","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic hardware implementation of Liquid State Machines","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-152-N-16080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089524S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727325,"authors":[{"name":"R. de Azambuja","affiliation":["Electronics and Mathematics, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"R.","lastName":"de Azambuja","id":"38581043300"},{"name":"A.

Inspired by the ideas of action learning and embodiment we use the safe and flexible industrial robot BAXTER in our experiments. The robot was taught to draw three different 2D shapes on top of a desk using a total of four joints.

It deals particularly well with time-series prediction tasks and reduces training complexity over recurrent neural networks. It is also suitable for hardware implementation whereby device physics are utilized in performing data processing. In this paper, the RC concept is applied to modeling a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. Due to the harsh propagation environment, the transmitted signal undergoes severe distortion that must be compensated for at the receiver. The nonlinear distortion introduced by the power amplifier at the transmitter further complicates this process. An effective channel estimation scheme is therefore required. In this paper, we introduce a MIMO-OFDM channel estimation scheme utilizing Echo State Network (ESN). Echo State Networks are powerful recurrent neural networks that can predict time-series very well. They acts as a black-box for system modeling purposes and models nonlinear dynamic systems efficiently. Simulation results for the bit error rate of the nonlinear MIMO-OFDM system show that the introduced channel estimator outperforms commonly used channel estimation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficient decoding scheme for nonlinear MIMO-OFDM network using reservoir computing","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727329","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727329.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficient decoding scheme for nonlinear MIMO-OFDM network using reservoir computing","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727329/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446895","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficient decoding scheme for nonlinear MIMO-OFDM network using reservoir computing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-157-N-16441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07058S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727330,"authors":[{"name":"Guopeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK"],"lastName":"Guopeng Zhang","id":"37087633749"},{"name":"Chun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chun Zhang","id":"37087073584"},{"name":"Shigang Yue","affiliation":["University of Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, GB"],"firstName":"Shigang","lastName":"Yue","id":"37333835800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727330","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727330","abstract":"An ability to predict collisions is essential for current vehicles and autonomous robots.

Despite major advances in neuroscience over the last few decades, an understanding of the brain's underlying mechanisms for pattern recognition remains unattained. Efforts to replicate such high-level brain functions on the basis of the limited, low-level known details of the brain have naturally led to critical assumptions that make brain-inspired machine learning possible. Convolutional neural networks are an example of such architectures, shown to produce state-of-the-art classification performance on practical applications. The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model, on the other hand, performs pattern and sequence recognition on the basis of highly biologically plausible structure and operation. In this work we build on the strengths of convolutional neural networks by integrating them into the HTM framework. An analysis of the common and complementary features between the two models results in the proposal of an innovative, hybrid machine learning architecture. Practical tests on a handwritten digit recognition task reveal a 2% fall in pattern recognition performance, compared to that of the original convolutional neural network design. Nevertheless, key HTM features embedded in the novel architecture enable its potential future enhancement with sequence learning and prediction, an inexistent capability in traditional convolutional neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727332","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1194","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating convolutional neural networks into a sparse distributed representation model based on mammalian cortical learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727332/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrating convolutional neural networks into a sparse distributed representation model based on mammalian cortical learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727332/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446313","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating convolutional neural networks into a sparse distributed representation model based on mammalian cortical learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-160-N-17160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086135S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727334,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, proper diagnosis of epilepsy requires the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures for a long period of time. Manual monitoring of long term EEG is tedious and costly. Therefore, a reliable automated seizure detection system is desirable. Most current state-of-the-art methods use hand crafted feature extraction and simple classification techniques, which often leads to sub-par performance due to lack of generalizability across patient dataset. Consequently, this work introduces novel deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) architecture to perform automated patient specific seizure detection using scalp EEG. We further propose a unique mapping of seizure EEG signal for efficient processing with the DRNN. This mapping allows the proposed deep architecture to simultaneously learn both temporal and spatial features of raw seizure EEG respectively. The proposed DRNN architecture is tested with long term patient specific scalp EEG data of 5 subjects with approximately 34 hours of EEG extracted from a publically available dataset. Overall, the proposed network successfully detects 100% of total seizure events with an average detection delay of ~7.0 sec. The results demonstrate superior performance to that of the current state-of-art seizure detection methods. The proposed DRNN architecture also obtains a runtime of approximately 30ms for 1 sec segment of 18 channel EEG. The low processing time with sparse use of computing resources and superior performance make the proposed architecture appropriate for real-time use.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727334","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1207","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727334.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep recurrent neural network for seizure detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Computer architecture","Recurrent neural networks","Scalp","Electrodes","Two dimensional displays","Epilepsy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical disorders","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","recurrent neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep recurrent neural network architecture","epileptic seizure detection","scalp EEG","epilepsy diagnosis","epileptic seizure analysis","automated patient specific seizure detection system","hand crafted feature extraction technique","simple classification technique","DRNN architecture","seizure EEG signal mapping","temporal features","spatial features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Network","Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network","Seizure detection","DRNN","EEG"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep recurrent neural network for seizure detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446367","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep recurrent neural network for seizure detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-162-N-16958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168234S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727339,"authors":[{"name":"Peng-Wei Hu","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, HK"],"firstName":"Peng-Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085897630"},{"name":"Keith C.C.

Traditionally, similarity-based methods use drug and target similarity matrices to infer the potential drug-target interactions. But these techniques do not handle biochemical data directly. While recent feature-based methods reveal simple patterns of physicochemical properties, efficient method to study large interactive features and precisely predict interactions is still missing. Deep learning has been found to be an appropriate tool for converting high-dimensional features to low-dimensional representations. These deep representations generated from drug-protein pair can serve as training examples for the interaction predictor. In this paper, we propose a promising approach called multi-scale features deep representations inferring interactions (MFDR). We extract the large-scale chemical structure and protein sequence descriptors so as to machine learning model predict if certain human target protein can interact with a specific drug. MFDR use Auto-Encoders as building blocks of deep network for reconstruct drug and protein features to low-dimensional new representations. Then, we make use of support vector machine to infer the potential drug-target interaction from deep representations. The experiment result shows that a deep neural network with Stacked Auto-Encoders exactly output interactive representations for the DTIs prediction task. MFDR is able to predict large-scale drug-target interactions with high accuracy and achieves results better than other feature-based approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727339","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727339.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1243","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-scale prediction of drug-target interactions from deep representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Large-scale prediction of drug-target interactions from deep representations","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727339/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430244","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-scale prediction of drug-target interactions from deep representations","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-167-N-17100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066124S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727342,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto F.

These networks are intended to simulate the mechanisms that govern how a set of effort commands changes the car's velocity and the direction it is moving. The first neural network receives as input a temporal sequence of current and previous throttle and brake efforts, along with a temporal sequence of the previous car's velocities (estimated by the network), and outputs the velocity that the real car would reach in the next time interval given these inputs. The second neural network estimates the arctangent of curvature (a variable related to the steering wheel angle) that a real car would reach in the next time interval given a temporal sequence of current and previous steering efforts and previous arctangents of curvatures of the car estimated by the network. We evaluated the performance of our simulator using real-world datasets acquired using an autonomous robotic car. Experimental results showed that our simulator was able to simulate in real time how a set of efforts influences the car's velocity and arctangent of curvature. While navigating in a map of a real-world environment, our car simulator was able to emulate the velocity and arctangent of curvature of the real car with mean squared error of 2.2\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n (m/s)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 4.0\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n rad\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727342","startPage":"1261","endPage":"1268","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727342.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulating robotic cars using time-delay neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automobiles","Robot sensing systems","Neural networks","Wheels","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","delays","mobile robots","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-delay neural networks","temporal sequence","autonomous robotic car"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Car Simulation","Time-delay Neural Networks","Autonomous Cars"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Simulating robotic cars using time-delay neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446814","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulating robotic cars using time-delay neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-170-N-16428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079457S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727344,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Most research in this field employs frequency domain analysis tools to analyse the features of PQ disturbances, such as Fourier transform and wavelet transform. However, the transient and steady-state characteristics of PQ disturbances are originally reflected on the waveforms of PQ disturbances, i.e., in time domain. In order to detect and classify the PQ disturbances in time domain, mathematical morphology (MM) and Teager energy operator (TEO), which are excellent analysis tools in time domain, are used for feature extraction in this paper. The features compose a feature vector. After that, a probabilistic neural network (PNN), which is more effective as a classifier than other neural network, is used to classify PQ disturbance signals. The feature vector composed of features extracted by MM and TEO is considered as the input of PNN. The proposed approach is tested by PQ disturbance signals, which are simulated according to the IEEE 1159-2009 standard, including swell, sag, interruption, harmonics, notching, oscillatory, fluctuation, and several combinations of these disturbances. The results demonstrate that the features extracted by MM and TEO are effective and the PNN classifies PQ disturbances with high accuracy rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727344/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446302","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727344/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of power quality disturbances in time domain using probabilistic neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of power quality disturbances in time domain using probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-172-N-16904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116935S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727345,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Wee Foo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K","Nanyang Polytechnic, School of Engineering, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Wee","lastName":"Foo","id":"37085443064"},{"name":"Cindy Goh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K"],"firstName":"Cindy","lastName":"Goh","id":"37085575659"},{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Li","id":"37336372600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727345","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Genetics","Biological cells","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","feedforward neural nets","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural neural network learning","evolutionary algorithms","genetic algorithm with speciation","GASP","scheme encoding","recombination method","artificial neural network","multilayer feedforward NN structure","linguistic complexity","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","neural networks","evolutionary computing","diversity","speciation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727345","abstract":"Following analyzing existing challenges in addressing the balance between exploration and exploitation encountered by evolutionary algorithms, this paper develops a Genetic Algorithm with speciation (GASP). It first incorporates a novel encoding scheme and recombination method for a balanced genetic divergence when locating global optima in complex applications, such as structural and dynamic design of an artificial neural network (NN). GASP also addresses the problem of defining a measure and track population diversity whose NN structure is subjected to continual reorganization during the evolution process. Further, a novel approach to the neural network phenotype is developed, which maps it to a distinct genome with a variable length capable of fully representing the multilayer feed-forward NN structure. Using the concept generalized from linguistic complexity, the distance between strings can thus be derived from the single string and substring counts. The GASP is then applied to an NN design problem to forecast the energy consumption of a built environment. With the optimal NN structure, diversity is tracked and improved. The results show that the GASP succeeds in obtaining excellent accuracy and speed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727345","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1290","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727345.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speciation and diversity balance for Genetic Algorithms and application to structural neural network learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727345/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speciation and diversity balance for Genetic Algorithms and application to structural neural network learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727345/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446724","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speciation and diversity balance for Genetic Algorithms and application to structural neural network learning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-173-N-16906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060084S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727350,"authors":[{"name":"Ihsan Ullah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Ihsan","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37085892385"},{"name":"Alfredo Petrosino","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, University of Napoli \u2019Parthenope\u2019, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Petrosino","id":"38553685500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727350","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Biological system modeling","Kernel","Biological neural networks","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pyramid structure","deep convolutional neural networks","CNN","biological neurons","convolutional layers","ImageNet-12 datasets","Cifar-100 datasets","Cifar-10 datasets","MNIST datasets","Caffe LENET","Alexnet model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727350","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) brought revolution without any doubt to various challenging tasks, mainly in computer vision.

Comparative analysis shows that the adjacency list, combined with a backwards indexing mechanism, scales up most efficiently both in terms of performance and of storage requirements.

The proposed method is illustrated on a case study of personalised modelling using clinical and EEG data of two groups of subjects - drug addicts and addicts under medication. The PSNN models help to achieve a better classification accuracy compared to global SNN models or when using traditional AI methods. A PSNN model visualisation enables discovery of new knowledge about individual persons and to distinguish complex STBD across subjects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalised modelling on integrated clinical and EEG Spatio-Temporal Brain Data in the NeuCube Spiking Neural Network system","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727358","endPage":"1378","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727358.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Electroencephalography","Neurons","Brain models","Computational modeling","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","electroencephalography","medical computing","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated clinical data","EEG spatio-temporal brain data","NeuCube spiking neural network system","personalised modelling framework","person clinical static data","STBD","personalised spiking neural network","NeuCube SNN architecture","PSNN models","classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["personalised modelling","spiking neural networks","NeuCube","spatiotemporal data","EEG data","opiate addict","methadone maintenance treatment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Personalised modelling on integrated clinical and EEG Spatio-Temporal Brain Data in the NeuCube Spiking Neural Network system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727358/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446301","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalised modelling on integrated clinical and EEG Spatio-Temporal Brain Data in the NeuCube Spiking Neural Network system","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-186-N-16821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046328S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727359,"authors":[{"name":"Junxiu Liu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Derry, Northern Ireland, UK"],"firstName":"Junxiu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085390869"},{"name":"Jim Harkin","affiliation":["School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Derry, Northern Ireland, UK"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Harkin","id":"37297997900"},{"name":"Liam McDaid","affiliation":["School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Derry, Northern Ireland, UK"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"McDaid","id":"37393462800"},{"name":"David M.

In this paper the application demonstrator of mobile robotics is employed to evaluate the fault-tolerant capabilities of the astrocyte-neuron network when implemented in a hardware-based robotic car system. Results demonstrated that when 20% or less synapses associated with a neuron are faulty, the robot car can maintain system performance and complete the task of forward motion correctly. If 80% synapses are faulty, the system performance shows a marginal degradation, however this degradation is much smaller than that of conventional fault-tolerant techniques under the same levels of faults.

A learning method, called \u201clearning-rate-optimizing genetic back-propagation\u201d (LOG-BP), which combines back propagation with a genetic algorithm by a new manner, is proposed. This method solves the above-mentioned two problems by optimizing the learning process, especially learning rate, by genetic mutations and by locality-controlled parallel search. Initial experimental results shows that LOG-BP performs better; that is, when required, learning rate decreases exponentially and the distances between chromosomes, which indicate the locality of a search, also decrease exponentially.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446888","htmlLink":"/document/7727372/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing neural-network learning rate by using a genetic algorithm with per-epoch mutations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing neural-network learning rate by using a genetic algorithm with per-epoch mutations","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-200-N-16244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057228S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727376,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko K\u00fcck","affiliation":["BIBA - Bremer Institut f\u00fcr Produktion und Logistik GmbH, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"K\u00fcck","id":"37085892408"},{"name":"Sven F.

With different statistical methods created for different time series patterns, large scale applications on 10,000s of times series require automatic method selection, often done manually by human experts based on various time series characteristics, or automatically using error metrics of past performance. However, the task of selecting adequate forecasting methods can also be viewed as a supervised learning problem. For instance, a neural network can be trained as a meta-learner relating characteristic time series features to the ex post accuracy of forecasting methods for each time series. Past research has proposed different sets of time series features for meta-learning including simple statistical or information-theoretic as well as model-based features, but have neglected the use of past forecast errors. This paper studies the predictive accuracy of using different feature sets for a neural network meta-learner selecting between four statistical forecasting models, introducing error-based features (landmarkers) and statistical tests as time series meta-features. A large-scale empirical study on NN3 industry data shows promising results of including error-based feature sets in meta-learning for selecting time series forecasting models.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727376","startPage":"1499","endPage":"1506","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727376.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meta-learning with neural networks and landmarking for forecasting model selection an empirical evaluation of different feature sets applied to industry data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727376/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Meta-learning with neural networks and landmarking for forecasting model selection an empirical evaluation of different feature sets applied to industry data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727376/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446618","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meta-learning with neural networks and landmarking for forecasting model selection an empirical evaluation of different feature sets applied to industry data","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-204-N-17158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096683S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727379,"authors":[{"name":"Moumita Saha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Moumita","lastName":"Saha","id":"38236408000"},{"name":"Pabitra Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Pabitra","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269155700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727379","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monsoons","Predictive models","Correlation","Biological system modeling","Training","Recurrent neural networks","Oceans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","monsoons","recurrent neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network based prediction","Indian summer monsoon","global climatic predictors","statistical models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727379","abstract":"Statistical models built on historical data are often found to be effective in forecasting Indian summer monsoon.

It was created organically by users as a way to categorize messages. Hashtags also provide valuable information for many research applications such as sentiment classification and topic analysis. However, only a small number of tweets are manually annotated. Therefore, an automatic hashtag recommendation method is needed to help users tag their new tweets. Previous methods mostly use conventional machine learning classifiers such as SVM or utilize collaborative filtering technique. A bottleneck of these approaches is that they all use the TF-IDF scheme to represent tweets and ignore the semantic information in tweets. In this paper, we also regard hashtag recommendation as a classification task but propose a novel recurrent neural network model to learn vector-based tweet representations to recommend hashtags. More precisely, we use a skip-gram model to generate distributed word representations and then apply a convolutional neural network to learn semantic sentence vectors. Afterwards, we make use of the sentence vectors to train a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). We directly use the produced tweet vectors as features to classify hashtags without any feature engineering.

Most of the research on human behaviour has been focused on recognizing individual issues from actions to behaviours. However, the analysis and recognition of group activities, the relationships of different groups in the scene and the interaction of the individuals in the group is still considered an open problem. This paper proposes a novel representation method to analyse and recognise group activities, called Group Activity Descriptor Vector (GADV). It is calculated from the trajectory described by the group and by the individuals who form it. Specifically, the GADV describes three different components: the trajectory followed by the group, the coherence of the individual trajectories in the group and, finally, the movement relationships among different groups in the scene. The trajectory analysis allows a simple high level understanding of complex groups activities. The GADV representation has been evaluated with different self-organizing neural networks using Behave and Caviar dataset sequences obtaining great accuracy in the recognition of the group activities, outperforming the state of the art methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727387","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727387.pdf","startPage":"1585","endPage":"1592","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group activity description and recognition based on trajectory analysis and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Group activity description and recognition based on trajectory analysis and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446472","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727387/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group activity description and recognition based on trajectory analysis and neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-215-N-17006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118194S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727390,"authors":[{"name":"Humberto Sossa","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional-CIC, Mexico City, MEXICO"],"firstName":"Humberto","lastName":"Sossa","id":"37281846500"},{"name":"\u00c1ngel Carre\u00f3n","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional-CIC, Mexico City, MEXICO"],"firstName":"\u00c1ngel","lastName":"Carre\u00f3n","id":"37085905597"},{"name":"Elizabeth Guevara","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional-CIC, Mexico City, MEXICO"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Guevara","id":"37085904098"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal Santiago","affiliation":["Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, MEXICO"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Santiago","id":"37085905438"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727390","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Shape","Neurons","Mathematical model","Biological neural networks","Computer architecture","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D image Euler number","artificial neural network","binary image","pattern classification problem","ANN architecture","morphological neural perceptron with dendritic processing","GPU implementation","MNPDP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Euler number computation","artificial neural networks","morphological neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727390","abstract":"We describe for the first time how the Euler number of a 2-D binary image can be obtained by means of Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

CNN has been one of the best classifiers for images and object recognition. However, the Backpropagation (BP) algorithm, mostly used for training CNN, suffers from slow learning, local minimum, and poor generalization. To solve these problems, a novel architecture called CNN-ELM has been proposed here. Its core architecture is based on a local image (local receptive field) version of the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) adopting random feature learning. Using MATLAB 2015a, classification experiments using the raw image data as input, show a comparable or mostly better classification performance compared to the BP trained CNN, with its training speed up to 200 times faster on MNIST, NORB, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Pedestrian detection experiments using INRIA datasets also exhibits much faster training than the BP trained CNN without sacrificing detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727403","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727403.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast training of convolutional neural network classifiers through extreme learning machines","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446856","htmlLink":"/document/7727403/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast training of convolutional neural network classifiers through extreme learning machines","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-231-N-16504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075529S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727410,"authors":[{"name":"Pin Lim","affiliation":["Rolls Royce Singapore Pte Ltd, Advance Technology Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085759616"},{"name":"Chi Keong Goh","affiliation":["Rolls Royce Singapore Pte Ltd, Advance Technology Center, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chi Keong","lastName":"Goh","id":"37551640700"},{"name":"Kay Chen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kay Chen","lastName":"Tan","id":"37334471700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727410","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":774},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727410","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Iron","Engines","Principal component analysis","Trajectory","Degradation","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","aerospace engines","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","remaining life assessment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time window neural network based framework","remaining useful life estimation","aeroengine RUL","modular components","moving time window","feature extraction method","multilayer neural network","machine learning algorithm","C-MAPSS dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks (NN)","Moving Time Window","Feature Extraction","RUL Estimation","C-MAPSS","Prognostics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727410","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727410.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A time window neural network based framework for Remaining Useful Life estimation","abstract":"This paper develops a framework for determining the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aero-engines.

Using the attributes of internet, the scientists have been able to create a web based social platform for learning any desired art by the subject himself/herself, and this particular procedure is termed as electronic learning or e-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel application of gesture dependent e-learning of dance. This e-learning procedure may provide help to many dance enthusiasts who cannot learn the art because of the scarcity of resources despite having great zeal. The paper mainly deals with recognition of different dance gestures of a trained user such that after detecting the discrepancies between the gestures shown and actually performed by a novice; the user can rectify his faults. The elementary knowledge of geometry has been employed to introduce the concept of planes in the feature extraction stage. Actually, five planes have been constructed to signify major body parts while keeping the synchronous parts in one unit. Then four distances and four angular features have been obtained to provide entire positional information of the different body joints. Finally, using a probabilistic neural network the dance gestures have been classified after training the said network with sufficient amount of data recorded from numerous subjects to maintain generality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727411/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446494","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727411/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Human skeleton matching for e-learning of dance using a probabilistic neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human skeleton matching for e-learning of dance using a probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-239-N-17074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064011S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727415,"authors":[{"name":"Soumitro Swapan Auddy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Soumitro Swapan","lastName":"Auddy","id":"37085886797"},{"name":"Kanishka Tyagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Kanishka","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37588471300"},{"name":"Son Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Son","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085894377"},{"name":"Michael Manry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Manry","id":"37085887880"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727415","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Training","Classification algorithms","Machine learning algorithms","Licenses","Algorithm design and analysis","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","probability","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminant vector transformations","neural network classifiers","discriminant functions","no free lunch theorem","license plate recognition database","multilayer perceptrons","neural net discriminants","approximate posterior probabilities"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant vector tranformations in neural network classifiers","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","endPage":"1786","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727415","startPage":"1780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727415","abstract":"We review the fact that several kinds of neural networks can be trained to approximate other types of discriminant functions, thereby throwing some doubt upon the utility of the No Free Lunch theorem.

Then an algorithm is developed and demonstrated for warping neural net discriminants into approximate posterior probabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446866","htmlLink":"/document/7727415/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant vector tranformations in neural network classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant vector tranformations in neural network classifiers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-243-N-17106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076471S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727423,"authors":[{"name":"Mahardhika Pratama","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and IT, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Mahardhika","lastName":"Pratama","id":"38233985400"},{"name":"Edwin Lughofer","affiliation":["Department of knowledge-based mathematical system, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Lughofer","id":"37270778300"},{"name":"Meng Joo Er","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Joo","lastName":"Er","id":"37271404600"},{"name":"Wenny Rahayu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and IT, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Wenny","lastName":"Rahayu","id":"37297484300"},{"name":"Tharam Dillon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and IT, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Tharam","lastName":"Dillon","id":"37266670100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Uncertainty","Network architecture","Fuzzy neural networks","Machine learning algorithms","Input variables","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","Gaussian processes","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolving type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network","evolving intelligent system","EIS","machine learning algorithm","eT2RFNN","double local recurrent connections","interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function","nonlinear wavelet function","rule base simplification procedure","dimensionality reduction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolving Fuzzy Systems","Fuzzy Neural Networks","Type-2 Fuzzy Systems","Sequential Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727423","abstract":"Evolving intelligent system (EIS) is a machine learning algorithm, specifically designed to deal with learning from large data streams.

It generates a generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule, where an interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function constructs the rule premise, and the rule consequent is crafted by the nonlinear wavelet function. eT2RFNN adopts an open structure, where it can start learning process from scratch with an empty rule base. Fuzzy rules can be automatically generated according to degree of nonlinearity data stream conveys. It can performs a rule base simplification procedure by pruning and merging inactive, outdated and overlapping rules. eT2RFNN can deal with the high dimensionality problem, where an online dimensionality reduction method is integrated in the training process. The efficacy of the eT2RFNN has been numerically validated using two real-world data streams, where it provides high predictive accuracy, while retaining low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727423","startPage":"1841","endPage":"1848","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727423/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727423/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446563","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-251-N-16191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12254S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727426,"authors":[{"name":"Thameur Dhieb","affiliation":["REGIM-Lab.: REsearch Groups in Intelligent Machines, National School of Engineers (ENIS), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Thameur","lastName":"Dhieb","id":"37085790682"},{"name":"Wael Ouarda","affiliation":["REGIM-Lab.: REsearch Groups in Intelligent Machines, National School of Engineers (ENIS), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Ouarda","id":"37085542948"},{"name":"Houcine Boubaker","affiliation":["REGIM-Lab.: REsearch Groups in Intelligent Machines, National School of Engineers (ENIS), Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Houcine","lastName":"Boubaker","id":"37946621800"},{"name":"Adel M.

Therefore, visualization has been used in a wide range of fields from biology, medicine, criminal activity analysis to business and education. Information visualization has become more important than ever as the amount of data being generated has increased dramatically in recent years. One of the major difficulties of information visualization is performance, and this is even more critical when visualizing big data. One potential solution to this challenge is data sampling while maintaining fidelity of visual representation. In this paper, we propose two new centrality clustering-based sampling approaches that apply centrality measures on clusters of data points in order to make more informed sampling than random sampling approaches. We evaluate the new methods on graph data sets. The results show that the new methods significantly outperform existing data sampling methods in term of perceived differences and their ability to preserve essential visual information. Moreover computational complexity is comparable or even better than simple random sampling methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727433","startPage":"1911","endPage":"1917","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727433.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centrality clustering-based sampling for big data visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Centrality clustering-based sampling for big data visualization","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727433/","accessionNumber":"16446645","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727433/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centrality clustering-based sampling for big data visualization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-261-N-16289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050724S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727444,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Manikandan Janakiraman","affiliation":["UARC/NASA Ames Research Center Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay Manikandan","lastName":"Janakiraman","id":"37826262800"},{"name":"David Nielsen","affiliation":["MORI Associates/NASA Ames Research Center Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37085453035"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727444","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":868},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Training","Data models","Adaptation models","Detection algorithms","Safety","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","air safety","computational complexity","data mining","pattern classification","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extreme learning machines","fast anomaly detection algorithms","large aviation data sets","outlier detection","one-class classification","aviation safety risks","MKAD computational complexity","very large data set mining","ELM fast training","unsupervised ELM algorithms","autoencoder","embedding models","nominal data distribution","outlier upper bound","real aviation safety benchmark problem","anomaly decision boundary"]}],"abstract":"We develop fast anomaly detection algorithms using extreme learning machines (ELM) to discover operationally significant anomalies in large aviation data sets. Anomaly detection (aka one-class classification or outlier detection) is an active area of research to identify safety risks in aviation. Aviation data is characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneity (continuous and categorical variables), multimodality and temporality. To address these challenges, NASA Ames has developed several anomaly detection algorithms including MKAD, the present state of the art [1]. MKAD's computational complexity is quadratic with respect to the number of training examples which makes it time consuming (and sometimes infeasible) for mining very large data sets. In this paper, we utilize ELM's fast training and good generalization properties to develop scalable anomaly detection algorithms for very large data sets. We adapt unsupervised ELM algorithms such as the autoencoder and embedding models to perform anomaly detection. The unsupervised models capture the nominal data distribution and by choosing a desired strength of detection that defines the upper bound of outliers in the training data, the anomaly decision boundary is determined. The autoencoder model detects anomalies as the ones that have a large reconstruction error while the embedding model detects anomalies as the ones that lie outside a hypersphere in the embedded space. The proposed algorithms are applied to a real aviation safety benchmark problem and the results show that the ELM based algorithms are comparable to MKAD in detection while training is made faster by two orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727444","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727444.pdf","startPage":"1993","endPage":"2000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in aviation data using extreme learning machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in aviation data using extreme learning machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446541","htmlLink":"/document/7727444/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in aviation data using extreme learning machines","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-272-N-16769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079322S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727446,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Chappet de Vangel","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet Chappet","lastName":"de Vangel","id":"37085393330"},{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my Fix","affiliation":["UMI 2958, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, METZ"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00e9my","lastName":"Fix","id":"37085896848"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727446","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"Dynamic neural field (DNF) is a popular mesoscopic model for cortical column interactions.

Performing numerical experiments for several data sets of networks, the efficiency of the blending method is confirmed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727449","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727449.pdf","startPage":"2031","endPage":"2038","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of various periodic orbits in simple dynamic binary neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of various periodic orbits in simple dynamic binary neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446811","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727449/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of various periodic orbits in simple dynamic binary neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-277-N-16676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107724S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727450,"authors":[{"name":"Rongye Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rongye","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086545830"},{"name":"Thomas C.

Theoretical analysis of the ONN reveals that transmission delays can produce frequency clustering that leads to synchronization and convergence failure. This paper describes the redesign of ONN dynamics and associated system-level architecture to achieve robustness. Specifically, we first demonstrate that using the phase information of zero-crossing points of inputs as the PLL error signal enables the ONN dynamical model to correctly synchronize under uniform transmission delays. A Type-II PLL based ONN architecture is shown via simulation to provide this property in hardware. Furthermore, to accommodate non-uniform transmission delays in hardware, a phase synchronization technique is proposed that is shown to provide the correct synchronization behavior.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727450","startPage":"2039","endPage":"2046","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727450.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of phase locked loop oscillatory neural networks: Mitigation of transmission delay effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Neurons","Phase locked loops","Synchronization","Hardware","Neural networks","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loop oscillatory neural networks","transmission delay effects","ONN","frequency clustering phenomenon mitigation","ONN dynamics","associated system-level architecture","zero-crossing points","PLL error signal","nonuniform transmission delays","phase synchronization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["associative memory","oscillatory neural network","pattern recognition","phase locked loops","transmission delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the design of phase locked loop oscillatory neural networks: Mitigation of transmission delay effects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446345","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of phase locked loop oscillatory neural networks: Mitigation of transmission delay effects","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-278-N-16310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072437S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727456,"authors":[{"name":"Trongmun Jiralerspong","affiliation":["Department of Robotics and Mechatronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Trongmun","lastName":"Jiralerspong","id":"37085525911"},{"name":"Sato Fumiya","affiliation":["Department of Robotics and Mechatronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Sato","lastName":"Fumiya","id":"37085888845"},{"name":"Chao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Robotics and Mechatronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085543561"},{"name":"Jun Ishikawa","affiliation":["Department of Robotics and Mechatronics, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37411328600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727456","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Electroencephalography","Brain-computer interfaces","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain machine interface","BMI","disabilities","aged people","signal processing","spectral analysis","artificial neural network","ANN","mental states classification","electroencephalographic signal","EEG signal","EEG acquisition device","electrodes","system performance evaluation","online classification experiments","mental tasks","classification threshold value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electroencephalogram (EEG)","brain machine interface (BMI)","artificial neural network","frequency analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727456","abstract":"Brain machine interface (BMI) is an emerging technology that aims to assist people with disabilities as well as the aged by allowing their users to intuitively control external devices by intent alone. This paper presents a signal processing technique for a low cost brain machine interface (BMI) that uses spectral analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify three mental states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this study, a BMI system has been prototyped to classify the intention of moving an object up or down and at rest state. EEG signals are recorded using a consumer grade EEG acquisition device. The device is equipped with 14 electrodes but only 8 electrodes are used in this study. To evaluate the system performance, online classification experiments for three subjects are conducted. True positive and false positive rates are used as an evaluation index. Experiment results show that despite the high difficulty of the mental tasks, the proposed method is capable of achieving an overall true positive rate of up to 67% with 15 minutes of training time by a first time BMI user. Furthermore, offline analysis is carried out using the same EEG data to explore ways of using spectral analysis and ANN to reduce erroneous classifications. Analysis results show that by setting the classification threshold value higher, the false positive rate can be reduced. Another finding suggests that in contrast with the study results by other research teams, the use of multiple ANNs to classify three mental states do not improve the accuracy. Lastly, a hamming window size of 64 samples is found to be optimal for achieving real-time control when performing spectral analysis.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727456","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727456.pdf","startPage":"2081","endPage":"2089","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis and artificial neural network based classification of three mental states for brain machine interface applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis and artificial neural network based classification of three mental states for brain machine interface applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446510","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727456/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis and artificial neural network based classification of three mental states for brain machine interface applications","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-284-N-16695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097744S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727458,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi H.

Early detection is crucial for ensuring five-year survival (which varies between 15% and 99% depending on the melanoma stage). Melanoma severity is typically diagnosed by invasive methods (e.g. a biopsy). In this paper, we propose an alternative system combining image analysis and machine learning for detecting melanoma presence and severity. The 86 features selected consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the melanoma. As opposed to previous studies that have focused on distinguishing melanoma and non-melanoma images, our work considers a finer-grain classification problem using five categories: benign lesions and 4 different stages of melanoma. The dataset presents two main characteristics that are approached by specific machine learning methods: 1) the classes representing melanoma severity follow a natural order, and 2) the dataset is imbalanced, where benign lesions clearly outnumber melanoma ones. Different nominal and ordinal classifiers are considered, one of them being based on an ordinal cascade decomposition method. The cascade method is shown to obtain good performance for all classes, while respecting and exploiting the order information. Moreover, we explore the alternative of applying a class balancing technique, presenting good synergy with the ordinal and nominal methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tackling the ordinal and imbalance nature of a melanoma image classification problem","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727466","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727466.pdf","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tackling the ordinal and imbalance nature of a melanoma image classification problem","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727466/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446739","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tackling the ordinal and imbalance nature of a melanoma image classification problem","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-294-N-16117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119154S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7727488,"authors":[{"name":"Ruoxia Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ruoxia","lastName":"Li","id":"37085887910"},{"name":"Jinde Cao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","id":"37290969000"},{"name":"Ying Wan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wan","id":"37085462215"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727488","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Neural networks","Circuit stability","Delay effects","Memristors","Resistance","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-time stability analysis","fractional-order delayed memristive neural networks","nonautonomous fractional order memristive systems","autonomous fractional order memristive systems","pure-time delay","external input","sufficient condition","algebraic inequality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727488","abstract":"In this paper, the finite-time stability analysis of non-autonomous and autonomous fractional order memristive systems with a pure time delay and commensurate order between 0 and 1 is proposed.

To attenuate the influence of the rate-dependent hysteresis, a modified inverse backlash operator (MIBO) is developed to act as the hidden layer neuron of the MENN to describe the dynamic behavior of the inverse rate-dependent hysteresis. The diagonal recurrent weights of context layer and the recurrent weights from hidden layer to context layer are designed to enhance the dynamic learning capability of the MENN. To determine an appropriate structure and the parameters of the MENN for adaptive inverse control, a MENN is trained first based on the data of inverse rate-dependent hysteresis. In view of the nonsmooth characteristics of the MIBOs, a restricted step proximal bundle (RSPB) method is employed to search the appropriate subgradients at the nonsmooth vertexes of the MIBOs. The relevant Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm is developed to acquire an appropriate MENN that is used as the initial controller to implement adaptive inverse control for rate-dependent hysteresis via gradient descent learning algorithm.

Unknown and unstable behaviour of data over time, limits the application of traditional anomaly detection methods that have been designed for stationary data. Moreover, basic assumptions of many existing works in the adaptive anomaly detection domain, such as the availability of labelled data over time or dealing with a known type of change in the data, are not valid for real-life applications. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised ensemble based anomaly detection method using One Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVMs). The proposed method is able to detect potential changes in the distribution of the normal data and adapts itself accordingly, without requiring any external feedback, e.g., ground truth labels. Moreover, it is able to automatically select an appropriate set of recent instances during learning phases, and an appropriate set of models during prediction phases by identifying active concepts. We evaluate our proposed method against state-of-the-art adaptive anomaly detection methods that can be applied in an unsupervised manner, on both real and synthetic non-stationary data. The results show that with considerably lower computational cost, our method outperforms the other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727507.pdf","startPage":"2476","endPage":"2483","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in non-stationary data: Ensemble based self-adaptive OCSVM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Training","Adaptation models","Kernel","Support vector machines","Computational efficiency","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machines","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary data","ensemble based self-adaptive OCSVM","data streaming","stationary data","adaptive anomaly detection domain","unsupervised ensemble based anomaly detection method","one class support vector machines","ground truth labels","learning phases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in non-stationary data: Ensemble based self-adaptive OCSVM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727507/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446509","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in non-stationary data: Ensemble based self-adaptive OCSVM","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-335-N-16485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074439S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727511,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e9rgio Aur\u00e9lio Ferreira Soares","affiliation":["L3C - Connectionism and Cognitive Science Lab, UFSC - Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"S\u00e9rgio Aur\u00e9lio Ferreira","lastName":"Soares","id":"37085893827"},{"name":"Guenther Schwedersky Neto","affiliation":["Petrobras Exploration and Production - Geologic Tecnology, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guenther Schwedersky","lastName":"Neto","id":"38255017200"},{"name":"Mauro Roisenberg","affiliation":["L3C - Connectionism and Cognitive Science Lab, UFSC - Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Roisenberg","id":"37353171700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727511","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Covariance matrices","Adaptation models","Data models","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","interpolation","mixture models","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental Gaussian mixture neural network model","spatial interpolation","spatial correlation","geostatistical methods","kriging","correlation model","semivariogram","IGMN neural network model","geostatistical sequential simulation","anisotropic datasets","sparse datasets","sequential Gaussian simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727511","abstract":"An important feature present in neural network models is their ability to learn from data, even when the user does not have much information about the particular dataset. However, the most popular models do not perform well in spatial interpolation problems due to their difficulty in accurately modeling spatial correlation between samples. On the other hand, one of the most important geostatistical methods for spatial interpolation, Kriging, performs very well but requires some expert knowledge to fit the correlation model (semivariogram). In this work, we adapt the Incremental Gaussian Mixture Network (IGMN) neural network model for spatial interpolation and geostatistical sequential simulation applications. Results show that our approach outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the original IGMN, especially in anisotropic and sparse datasets. Also, we propose an algorithm for Sequential Gaussian Simulation that uses IGMN instead of Kriging and can successfully generate equally probable realizations of the defined grid.

Combining deep learning and classification ensemble technology, this paper presents a novel DBN hierarchical ensemble model for HST fault analysis. Firstly, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients of the HST vibration signals are extracted as the state of the visible layer of the model, and then DBN is used to learn the hierarchical features of the vibration signals automatically. The features of each layer learned by DBN are used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network respectively. Finally, the Majority Voting (MV), the Classification Entropy Voting Principle (CE), and the Winner Takes All (WTA) ensemble strategies are used for combination to get the final results. The experiments are conducted by using laboratory data sets and simulation data sets. The results show that the fault recognition rate of the proposed model is much higher than the traditional fault analysis methods. In addition, unlike the DBN model, the proposed model is affected slightly by the number of network layers and the size of hidden units.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727518","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727518.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Analytical models","Vibrations","Entropy","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","entropy","fast Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","radial basis function networks","railway engineering","railways","signal classification","support vector machines","vibrational signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed train fault analysis","DBN hierarchical ensemble","deep belief network","classification ensemble technology","HST fault analysis","fast Fourier transform","FFT coefficients","HST vibration signals","support vector machine","SVM","K-nearest neighbor","KNN","radial basis function","RBF neural network","majority voting","MV","classification entropy voting principle","CE","winner takes all","WTA ensemble strategies","fault recognition rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high speed train (HST)","fault analysis","deep belief network (DBN)","classification ensemble"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault analysis of High Speed Train with DBN hierarchical ensemble","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727518/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727518/","accessionNumber":"16446482","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault analysis of High Speed Train with DBN hierarchical ensemble","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-346-N-16132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05747S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727519,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Alexandre Spanhol","affiliation":["Federal University of Technology, Parana Toledo, PR, Brazil","Federal University of Parana, VRI Lab, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fabio Alexandre","lastName":"Spanhol","id":"37085777654"},{"name":"Luiz S.

On the other hand, deep learning can extract and organize the discriminative information from the data, not requiring the design of feature extractors by a domain expert. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a particular type of deep, feedforward network that have gained attention from research community and industry, achieving empirical successes in tasks such as speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing and transfer learning. In this paper, we conduct some preliminary experiments using the deep learning approach to classify breast cancer histopathological images from BreaKHis, a publicly dataset available at http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. We propose a method based on the extraction of image patches for training the CNN and the combination of these patches for final classification. This method aims to allow using the high-resolution histopathological images from BreaKHis as input to existing CNN, avoiding adaptations of the model that can lead to a more complex and computationally costly architecture. The CNN performance is better when compared to previously reported results obtained by other machine learning models trained with hand-crafted textural descriptors. Finally, we also investigate the combination of different CNNs using simple fusion rules, achieving some improvement in recognition rates.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727519","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727519.pdf","startPage":"2560","endPage":"2567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast cancer histopathological image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727519/","displayDocTitle":"Breast cancer histopathological image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727519/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446889","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast cancer histopathological image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-347-N-16315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080497S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"294","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7727521,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz G.

We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian PUC-PR.

In addition to its scientific importance, the use of noise has attracted interest because of its potential to overcome the present limitations in engineering applications. In this study, we investigate the use of a universal approximator exploiting SR as a new realization of well-established feed-forward neural networks. The proposed universal approximator consists of groups of threshold elements. Although the approximation universality of a network consisting of threshold elements has been proven in terms of extreme learning machine implementations, once SR is taken into account, the system can be modeled in a form identical to that of a classic generic three-layered neural network, for which the universal approximation capability has been proven. The capability of the proposed approximator for serving as a universal approximator is first proven theoretically in the limit of an infinite number of hidden units. Subsequently, the performance achieved by the backpropagation type and the extreme learning machine type learning algorithms is experimentally evaluated for cases involving limited numbers of hidden units, highlighting the SR effect occurring in the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727525","startPage":"2603","endPage":"2608","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727525.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic resonance induced continuous activation functions in a neural network consisting of threshold elements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stochastic resonance","Approximation algorithms","Probabilistic logic","Density functional theory","Cost function","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","backpropagation","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic resonance induced continuous activation functions","threshold elements","SR","nonlinear systems","biological system","artificial system","universal approximator","feed-forward neural networks","extreme learning machine","backpropagation type"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic resonance induced continuous activation functions in a neural network consisting of threshold elements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446824","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic resonance induced continuous activation functions in a neural network consisting of threshold elements","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-353-N-17099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082749S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727529,"authors":[{"name":"Siqi Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Siqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085904853"},{"name":"En Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"En","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085906404"},{"name":"Jianping Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085890941"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727529","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Encoding","Feature extraction","Two dimensional displays","Training","Surveillance","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image sensors","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","video streaming","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video anomaly detection","ULGP-OF descriptor","one class ELM","smart video analysis","camera surveillance","uniform local gradient pattern based optical flow","one class extreme learning machine","OCELM","robust 2D image texture descriptor LGP","video optical flow","motion characteristics","texture characteristics","video streaming"]}],"abstract":"Smart video analysis is attracting increasing attention with the pervasive use of surveillance camera. In this paper, we address video anomaly detection by Uniform Local Gradient Pattern based Optical Flow (ULGP-OF) descriptor and one-class extreme learning machine (OCELM). Using the proposed ULGP-OF descriptor, we naturally combine the robust 2D image texture descriptor LGP with video optical flow to jointly descibe the texture and motion characteristics of video. ULGP-OF significantly outperforms other frequently-used classic video decriptors by a 6% to 10% EER reduction. As to normal video event modeling, the newly emergent ELM is introduced for the first time to tackle the unbearable training time incurred by massive training data from video streams. Compared to classic data description algorithms like one-class SVM (OCSVM) and sparse coding, OCELM can yield competitive results with a significant improvement in learning speed, which makes our approach more applicable to large-scale video analysis and easier for updating when video data are explosively generated in this day and age. Moreover, by adopting consistency-based criteria, only one parameter needs to be appointed for OCELM before training, which renders our approach much more parameter-free than other anomaly detection techniques like sparse coding. Experiments on UCSD ped1 and ped2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video anomaly detection based on ULGP-OF descriptor and one-class ELM","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727529","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727529.pdf","startPage":"2630","endPage":"2637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Video anomaly detection based on ULGP-OF descriptor and one-class ELM","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727529/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446649","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video anomaly detection based on ULGP-OF descriptor and one-class ELM","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-357-N-17167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08095S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727543,"authors":[{"name":"Joris Lueckenga","affiliation":["Josef Ressel Center for User-Centric Smart Grid Privacy, Security and Control Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Salzburg, Austria"],"firstName":"Joris","lastName":"Lueckenga","id":"37085895626"},{"name":"Dominik Engel","affiliation":["Josef Ressel Center for User-Centric Smart Grid Privacy, Security and Control Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Salzburg, Austria"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Engel","id":"37324367100"},{"name":"Robert Green","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Green","id":"37532258600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727543","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Intrusion detection","Protocols","Testing","Training","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","power engineering computing","security of data","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted vote algorithm combination technique","anomaly based smart grid intrusion detection systems","IDS","attack vectors","anomaly detection technique","zero-day attacks","weighted vote classification","general weight calculation function"]}],"abstract":"Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) are a crucial and necessary aspect of the smart grid, particularly when considering the possible attack vectors and their consequences.

G2P is a very important component in applications like text-to-speech, automatic speech recognition etc,. Because the number of graphemes that a word consists of and the corresponding number of phonemes are different, they are first aligned and then mapped. With the recent advent of sequence to sequence neural networks, the alignment step can be skipped allowing us to directly map the input and output sequences. Although the sequence to sequence neural nets have been applied for this task very recently, there are some questions concerning the architecture that need to be addressed. We show in this paper that, complex recurrent neural network units (like long-short term memory cells) may not be required to achieve good performance on this task. Instead simple recurrent neural networks (RNN) will suffice. We also show that the encoder can be a uni-directional RNN as opposed to the usually preferred bi-directional RNN. Further, our experiments reveal that encoder-decoder models with soft-alignment outperforms fixed vector context counterpart. The results demonstrate that with very few parameters we can indeed achieve comparable performance to much more complicated architectures.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727552","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727552.pdf","startPage":"2798","endPage":"2804","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of sequence to sequence neural networks on grapheme to phoneme conversion task","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of sequence to sequence neural networks on grapheme to phoneme conversion task","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430276","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727552/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of sequence to sequence neural networks on grapheme to phoneme conversion task","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-380-N-16359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080905S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727554,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Nikovski","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Nikovski","id":"37284684700"},{"name":"Kiran Byadarhaly","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Byadarhaly","id":"37085884064"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727554","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","Estimation","Data models","Gaussian distribution","Loss measurement","Sensors","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","Gaussian distribution","Internet of Things","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized covariance matrix estimation","supervised anomaly detection problems","high-dimensional covariance matrices estimation","Internet of Things","high-dimensional data points","multivariate Gaussian distribution","CM regularization","training data","CM estimation","area under the resulting receiver-operator characteristic","AUROC","decision problem"]}],"abstract":"We address the problem of estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices (CM) for the explicit purpose of supervised anomaly detection, in the case when the number n of data points is lower than their dimensionality p. This is increasingly common with the emergence of the Internet of Things that makes it possible to collect data from many sensors simultaneously, resulting in very high-dimensional data points. When we attempt to perform anomaly detection for such data by modeling the normal behavior of the system by means of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and n <; p, the sample CM is singular, and cannot be used directly without some form of regularization. In contrast to existing methods for CM regularization that aim to fit the training data accurately, we propose a regularization algorithm for CM estimation that directly aims to maximize the area under the resulting receiver-operator characteristic (AUROC) for the ultimate decision problem that needs to be solved: anomaly detection. Experiments on test problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to find CM estimates significantly better at anomaly detection than existing estimation methods that are unaware of the decision task that the CMs they produce will be used in.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized covariance matrix estimation with high dimensional data for supervised anomaly detection problems","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727554","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727554.pdf","startPage":"2811","endPage":"2818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Regularized covariance matrix estimation with high dimensional data for supervised anomaly detection problems","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727554/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446722","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized covariance matrix estimation with high dimensional data for supervised anomaly detection problems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-382-N-16645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055777S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727567,"authors":[{"name":"Weizhong Yan","affiliation":["Machine Learning Lab, GE Global Research Center Niskayuna, New York"],"firstName":"Weizhong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37291961800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727567","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Training","Maintenance engineering","Neurons","Kernel","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","gas turbines","learning (artificial intelligence)","maintenance engineering","mechanical engineering computing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-class extreme learning machines","gas turbine combustor anomaly detection","maintenance costs","power plant operations","ELM","SVM","machine learning methods","machine learning problems","binary classification","multiclass classification","domain-industrial machine condition monitoring","one-class classifiers","one-class classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","combustor","extreme learning machine","gas turbine","one-class classification"]}],"abstract":"Gas turbine combustor anomaly detection plays a critical role in reducing operation and maintenance costs in power plant operations. One-class classification, to learn a model that properly describes the normal samples, is one of many anomaly detection approaches that have shown promising performance in real-world applications. Extreme learning machines (ELMs), a recent developed machine learning technique, have outperformed SVMs and other machine learning methods for many machine learning problems. ELMs have been originally used for binary or multiclass classification and regression as well. Using ELM for one-class classification has emerged very recently, but has not been widely explored for real world applications. In this paper, we adopt ELMs to a new application domain - industrial machine condition monitoring. More specifically, we apply one-class ELMs for more accurate anomaly detection of gas turbine combustors. We evaluate different one-class ELMs and compare them against other one-class classifiers. Using a real-world gas turbine combustor anomaly detection as the case study, we demonstrate that one-class ELMs can be more effective than other one-class classification algorithms in early detecting gas turbine combustor anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727567","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","startPage":"2909","endPage":"2914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-class extreme learning machines for gas turbine combustor anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"One-class extreme learning machines for gas turbine combustor anomaly detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727567/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430272","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727567/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-class extreme learning machines for gas turbine combustor anomaly detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-395-N-16110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075531S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727571,"authors":[{"name":"Migel D.

The proposed system monitors the packet traffic on a subnet of unused IPs called darknet. Almost all darknet packets are originated from malicious activities. However, it is not obvious what traffic patterns DDoS attacks have. Therefore, we adopt a classifier and train it with traffic features of known DDoS attacks using 80/TCP and 53/UDP packets which can be labeled based on the header information and payloads. The proposed system consists of the two parts: pre-processing and classifier. In the pre-processing part, darknet packets for 30 seconds are transformed into a feature vector which consists of 17 traffic features on darknet traffic. As for the classifier part, we adopt Resource Allocating Network with Locality Sensitive Hashing (RAN-LSH) in which data to be trained are selected by using LSH and fast online learning is actualized by training only selected data. The learning of RAN-LSH is carried out not only with the training data for 80/TCP and 53/UDP packets but also with new training data labeled by a supervisor. The performance of the proposed detection system is evaluated for 9,968 training data obtained from 80/TCP and 53/UDP packets and 5,933 test data obtained from darknet packets with other protocols and source/destination ports. The results indicate that the proposed system detects backscatter packets caused by DDoS attacks accurately and adapts to new attacks quickly.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727577","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727577.pdf","startPage":"2979","endPage":"2985","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model for detecting DDoS attacks using darknet traffic features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A neural network model for detecting DDoS attacks using darknet traffic features","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446669","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727577/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network model for detecting DDoS attacks using darknet traffic features","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-405-N-17132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059648S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727586,"authors":[{"name":"Kunal Dahiya","affiliation":["Visual Learning and Intelligence Group (VIGIL), Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Kunal","lastName":"Dahiya","id":"37085886760"},{"name":"Dinesh Singh","affiliation":["Visual Learning and Intelligence Group (VIGIL), Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085888026"},{"name":"C.

Also, we present a consolidation approach for violation reporting which helps in improving reliability of the proposed approach. In order to evaluate our approach, we have provided a performance comparison of three widely used feature representations namely histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and local binary patterns (LBP) for classification.

In practice, an AOS system needs to address two core subtasks, aspect extraction and sentiment classification. Most existing approaches to aspect extraction, using linguistic analysis or topic modeling, are general across different products but not precise enough or suitable for particular products. Instead we take a less general but more precise scheme, which directly maps each review sentence into pre-defined aspects. To tackle aspect mapping and sentiment classification, we propose two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods, cascaded CNN and multitask CNN. Cascaded CNN contains two levels of convolutional networks. Multiple CNNs at level 1 deal with aspect mapping task, and a single CNN at level 2 deals with sentiment classification. Multitask CNN also contains multiple aspect CNNs and a sentiment CNN, but different networks share the same word embeddings. Experimental results show that both cascaded and multitask CNNs with pre-trained word embedding outperform linear classifiers, and multitask CNN generally performs better than cascaded CNN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727602/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446613","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Aspect-based Opinion Summarization with Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aspect-based Opinion Summarization with Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-430-N-16479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113736S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727604,"authors":[{"name":"Man Lan","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing","Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, P.

In this work, we present three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models to learn sentiment word vectors (SWV), which integrate sentiment information with semantic and syntactic information into word representations in three different strategies.

Inspecting the status of insulators from aerial images has been challenging due to the complex background and rapid view changing under different illumination conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to inspect the insulators with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A CNN model with multi-patch feature extraction method is applied to represent the status of insulators and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained based on these features. A thorough evaluation is conducted on our insulator status dataset of six classes from real inspection videos. The experimental results show that a pre-trained model for classification is more accurate than the shallow features by hand-crafted. Our approach achieves 98.7095% mean Average Precision (mAP) in status classification. We also study the behavior of the neural activations of the convolutional layers.

Interesting advancements are observed with respect to a previous work. A comparative and extensive analysis is lead among four different neural networks (NN). In particular, we exploit Deep Belief Network (DBN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network (BLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The latter has recently encountered a large success in the computational audio processing field and it has been successfully employed in our task. Two home recorded datasets are used in order to approximate real-life scenarios. They contain audio files from several microphones arranged in various rooms, from whom six features are extracted and used as input for the deep neural classifiers. The output stage has been redesigned compared to the previous author's contribution, in order to take advantage of the networks discriminative ability. Our study is composed by a multi-stage analysis focusing on the selection of the features, the network size and the input microphones. Results are evaluated in terms of Speech Activity Detection error rate (SAD). As result, a best SAD equal to 5.8% and 2.6% is reached respectively in the two considered datasets. In addiction, a significant solidity in terms of microphone positioning is observed in the case of CNN.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727633","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727633.pdf","startPage":"3391","endPage":"3398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural networks for Multi-Room Voice Activity Detection: Advancements and comparative evaluation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446285","htmlLink":"/document/7727633/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural networks for Multi-Room Voice Activity Detection: Advancements and comparative evaluation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-461-N-16689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.163916S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727634,"authors":[{"name":"Emre Cakir","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Cakir","id":"37085628563"},{"name":"Ezgi Can Ozan","affiliation":["Oricon Energy Co.

One of the key factors of this improvement is the capability of deep architectures to automatically learn higher levels of acoustic features in each layer. In this work, we aim to combine the feature learning capabilities of deep architectures with the empirical knowledge of human perception. We use the first layer of a deep neural network to learn a mapping from a high-resolution magnitude spectrum to smaller amount of frequency bands, which effectively learns a filterbank for the sound event detection task. We initialize the first hidden layer weights to match with the perceptually motivated mel filterbank magnitude response. We also integrate this initialization scheme with context windowing by using an appropriately constrained deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method does not only result with better detection accuracy, but also provides insight on the frequencies deemed essential for better discrimination of given sound events.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430279","htmlLink":"/document/7727634/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Filterbank learning for deep neural network based polyphonic sound event detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filterbank learning for deep neural network based polyphonic sound event detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-462-N-16149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081689S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727635,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Hertel","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, University of Luebeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Hertel","id":"37085636484"},{"name":"Huy Phan","affiliation":["Graduate School for Computing in Medicine and Life Sciences, University of Luebeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Phan","id":"37085345126"},{"name":"Alfred Mertins","affiliation":["Institute for Signal Processing, University of Luebeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Mertins","id":"37271261500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727635","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":585},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing time and frequency domain for audio event recognition using deep learning","abstract":"Recognizing acoustic events is an intricate problem for a machine and an emerging field of research. Deep neural networks achieve convincing results and are currently the state-of-the-art approach for many tasks. One advantage is their implicit feature learning, opposite to an explicit feature extraction of the input signal. In this work, we analyzed whether more discriminative features can be learned from either the time-domain or the frequency-domain representation of the audio signal. For this purpose, we trained multiple deep networks with different architectures on the Freiburg-106 and ESC-10 datasets. Our results show that feature learning from the frequency domain is superior to the time domain.

By doing so, we exploit the fact that a window containing a few frames of the sequential data is a sequence itself and this additional structure might encapsulate valuable information. In addition, we allow for more steps of computation in the feature extraction process, which is potentially beneficial as an affine function followed by a non-linearity can result in too simple features. Using our convolutional recurrent layers, we obtain an improvement in performance in two audio classification tasks, compared to traditional convolutional layers.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727636","startPage":"3412","endPage":"3419","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727636.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional RNN: An enhanced model for extracting features from sequential data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Data mining","Data models","Recurrent neural networks","Standards","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","data encapsulation","feature extraction","recurrent neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional RNN","enhanced model","feature extraction","sequential data","data patch","input affine function","recurrent neural network","recurrent units","information encapsulation","convolutional recurrent layers","audio classification tasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional RNN: An enhanced model for extracting features from sequential data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446463","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional RNN: An enhanced model for extracting features from sequential data","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-464-N-16429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083152S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7727642,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, P.

However, deep neural networks suffer from slow learning speed since most used training algorithms are based on variations of the gradient descent algorithms which require iterative optimization and thus are time-consuming. In addition, a series of control parameters need to be specified empirically which lacks of the theoretical guidance, and current learning algorithms for deep networks are not very suitable to incremental learning scenario. To address these issues, we propose a fast learning scheme in this paper. The basic idea of our approach is to pre-train basic units such as auto-encoders of the deep architecture in an analytical way without any iterative optimization procedure. This scheme is also extended to an incremental learning version. The experimental result shows the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art gradient descent based algorithms. To demonstrate the impact of our algorithm on complicated real world applications, we give an example of its performance in astronomical spectra pattern recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727642","startPage":"3453","endPage":"3460","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727642.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pseudoinverse incremental algorithm for fast training deep neural networks with application to spectra pattern recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurons","Machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Astronomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optimisation","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudoinverse incremental algorithm","fast training deep neural networks","deep learning scheme","hierarchical representations","signal processing tasks","information processing tasks","gradient descent algorithms","incremental learning scenario","auto-encoders","deep architecture","iterative optimization procedure","real world applications","astronomical spectra pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A pseudoinverse incremental algorithm for fast training deep neural networks with application to spectra pattern recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446318","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pseudoinverse incremental algorithm for fast training deep neural networks with application to spectra pattern recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-470-N-16544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091114S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727667,"authors":[{"name":"Songlin Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, P.

Compared with the conventional periodic sampled-data neural-network-based control in previous works, the main advantage of this paper is that the proposed event-based sampling and transmission scheme not only reduces the updating frequency of the controller, but also guarantees the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system without dramatically degrading the overall system performance. Based on a discontinuous Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, a convex combination technique and the Wirtinger-based integral inequality, some new criteria are derived to guarantee the asymptotical stability and certain performance of closed-loop system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the proposed criteria, a co-design method is presented to obtain the triggering parameter and the connection weights of the neural network simultaneously while ensuring a certain system performance.

However, SC algorithms require normally large computational resources which are incompatible with the kind of the electronic systems that can be deployed in cars where the size, cost and power consumption are always very restrictive. In this paper we present a NN-based driving recognition system, able to model the driving style of different drivers. Such a system could be used to detect abnormal driving behaviours and hence, to avoid dangerous situations. In order to obtain an optimized network in terms of size and complexity, we make the design by using a multiobjective genetic algorithm that provides at the same time a reduced number of input variables and a low number of neurons in the network. To make feasible the operation of the algorithm, we select Extreme Learning Machines as NNs as they have a learning mechanism very fast and

However, machine learning is data-driven and obtaining labeled data is often challenging in real applications. Techniques that try to overcome this burden, especially, in the presence of sparsely labeled data, can be found in the field of semi-supervised or active learning, as both make use of unlabeled data. In this paper, a semi-supervised k-nearest neighbor classifier, called Resp-kNN, is proposed for sparsely labeled data. This classifier is based on a probabilistic mixture model and, therefore, combines the advantages of classifiers based on non-parametric density estimate (such as a classical k-nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance) and classifiers based on parametric density estimates (such as classifiers based on Gaussian mixtures). Experimental results on 21 publicly available benchmark data sets show that Resp-kNN is more robust (regarding the choice of k) and effective for sparsely labeled classification compared to several standard methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727725","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727725.pdf","startPage":"4040","endPage":"4047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resp-kNN: A probabilistic k-nearest neighbor classifier for sparsely labeled data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727725/","displayDocTitle":"Resp-kNN: A probabilistic k-nearest neighbor classifier for sparsely labeled data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446337","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727725/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resp-kNN: A probabilistic k-nearest neighbor classifier for sparsely labeled data","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-553-N-17084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106413S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727733,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Xia Hong","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Hong","id":"37275522300"},{"name":"Emad Khalaf","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Khalaf","id":"37085902546"},{"name":"Fuad E.

The same is related to deep learning. MLMVN is a feedforward complex-valued neural network, which has a number of advantages when compared to real-valued neural networks. These advantages include derivative-free learning and significantly better generalization capability. To extend applicability of MLMVN, its GPU-based software implementation shall be considered. We present basic principles of the GPU simulator of MLMVN and how matrix algebra operations are specifically employed there. It is shown that the bigger the network is, the more beneficial is its GPU implementation. It is shown that up to 32\u00d7 acceleration can be achieved for the MLMVN learning process.

Specifically, we perform a fine-grained sentiment analysis task with implementations on two different systems: one using conventional spiking neural network (SNN) simulators and the other one using IBM's Neurosynaptic System TrueNorth. Input words are projected into a high-dimensional semantic space and processed through a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) containing rectified linear units (ReLU) trained via backpropagation. After training, this FCNN is converted to a SNN by substituting the ReLUs with integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that there is practically no performance loss due to conversion to a spiking network on a sentiment analysis test set, i.e. correlations with human annotations differ by less than 0.02 between the original DNN and its spiking equivalent. Additionally, we show that the SNN generated with this technique can be mapped to existing neuromorphic hardware - in our case, the TrueNorth chip. Mapping to the chip involves 4-bit synaptic weight discretization and adjustment of the neuron thresholds. The resulting end-to-end system can take a user input, i.e. a word in a vocabulary of over 300,000 words, and estimate its sentiment on TrueNorth with a power consumption of approximately 50 \u03bcW.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727758","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727758.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","startPage":"4278","endPage":"4285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TrueHappiness: Neuromorphic emotion recognition on TrueNorth","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TrueHappiness: Neuromorphic emotion recognition on TrueNorth","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727758/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16430243","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727758/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TrueHappiness: Neuromorphic emotion recognition on TrueNorth","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-586-N-16542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070639S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7727759,"authors":[{"name":"Khadeer Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Khadeer","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38235828000"},{"name":"Amar Shrestha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Amar","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37085848686"},{"name":"Qinru Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qinru","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37267088600"},{"name":"Qing Wu","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate, Rome, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37067990500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727759","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":531},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic inference using stochastic spiking neural networks on a neurosynaptic processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Computational modeling","Bayes methods","Stochastic processes","Biological neural networks","Probabilistic logic","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","inference mechanisms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic inference","stochastic spiking neural networks","neurosynaptic processor","neural computation","information exchange","Bayesian inference","IBM TrueNorth","sentence construction","TrueNorth corelet designs"]}],"abstract":"Spiking neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity for their ability to perform efficient computation akin to the way a brain processes information.

This performance is achieved using only 11 of the available 4096 cores on the chip, offering the potential for scalability for real-world applications of this system.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727761","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727761.pdf","startPage":"4302","endPage":"4307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727761/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse approximation on energy efficient hardware","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446351","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727761/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse approximation on energy efficient hardware","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-589-N-17170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076846S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727769,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085706370"},{"name":"Kay Chen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kay Chen","lastName":"Tan","id":"37334471700"},{"name":"Ruoxu Ren","affiliation":["Rolls-Royce Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ruoxu","lastName":"Ren","id":"37089141153"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727769","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":795},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Sociology","Statistics","Linear matrix inequalities","Neurons","Next generation networking","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","data handling","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-sensitive deep belief network training","imbalanced data problems","skewed class distributions","DBN","machine learning","imbalanced classification","multiclass scenario","evolutionary algorithm","misclassification cost optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727769","abstract":"Many real-world problems are usually unbalanced, where datasets present skewed class distributions, such as failure diagnosis, spam detection, anomaly detection, fraud detection, oil spillage detection and medical diagnosis, etc. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a competitive machine learning technique with good performance in many applications. However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets. An evolutionary algorithm is also implemented to optimize the misclassification costs for each class in cost matrix.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727769","startPage":"4362","endPage":"4367","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727769.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks on imbalance data problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Training cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks on imbalance data problems","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727769/","accessionNumber":"16446772","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727769/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks on imbalance data problems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-597-N-26028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067753S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7727770,"authors":[{"name":"Shoujin Wang","affiliation":["Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Shoujin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085892742"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37676211400"},{"name":"Jia Wu","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537239000"},{"name":"Longbing Cao","affiliation":["Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Longbing","lastName":"Cao","id":"37281405200"},{"name":"Qinxue Meng","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinxue","lastName":"Meng","id":"37085586245"},{"name":"Paul J.

Various domains including pattern recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing have witnessed the great power of deep networks. However, current studies on deep learning mainly focus on data sets with balanced class labels, while its performance on imbalanced data is not well examined. Imbalanced data sets exist widely in real world and they have been providing great challenges for classification tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of classification using deep network on imbalanced data sets. Specifically, a novel loss function called mean false error together with its improved version mean squared false error are proposed for the training of deep networks on imbalanced data sets. The proposed method can effectively capture classification errors from both majority class and minority class equally. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with conventional methods in classifying imbalanced data sets on deep neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727770","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727770.pdf","startPage":"4368","endPage":"4374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training deep neural networks on imbalanced data sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Training deep neural networks on imbalanced data sets","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727770/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446670","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training deep neural networks on imbalanced data sets","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-598-N-16326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081449S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7727775,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Aizenberg","affiliation":["Manhattan College, Riverdale, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Aizenberg","id":"37283170900"},{"name":"Antonio Luchetta","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Luchetta","id":"38494527600"},{"name":"Stefano Manetti","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Manetti","id":"37283669300"},{"name":"Maria Cristina Piccirilli","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria Cristina","lastName":"Piccirilli","id":"37324584900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727775","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Nonhomogeneous media","Integrated circuit modeling","Frequency measurement","Frequency response","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed parameter systems","frequency response","identification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system identification","FRA","arbitrary complex-valued inputs","lumped models","distributed parameter systems","frequency response analysis","component values","multilayer neural network with multivalued neurons","MLMVN learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lumped Models","Multi-Valued Neuron","Multilayer Neural Network with Multi-Valued Neurons","Analog Circuits","Testability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727775","abstract":"A new architecture for the identification of lumped models of distributed parameter systems is proposed in this paper.

The robust control law of the original uncertain nonlinear system is derived by adding a feedback gain to the optimal control law of the nominal system. It is proven that this robust control law can achieve optimality under a specified cost function. Then, the neural-network-based model-free policy iteration algorithm is developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system without system dynamics. The actor-critic technique and the least squares implementation method are used to obtain the optimal control policy of the nominal system. A numerical simulation is given to verify the applicability of the present robust optimal control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727795/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446640","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727795/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based robust optimal control of uncertain nonlinear systems using model-free policy iteration algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based robust optimal control of uncertain nonlinear systems using model-free policy iteration algorithm","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-623-N-26004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073703S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727801,"authors":[{"name":"Dexing Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Engineering Technology Research Center of Shaanxi Province on Intelligent Control and Industrial Big Data Processing, Xi'an, PR China"],"firstName":"Dexing","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085884697"},{"name":"Xuefei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Engineering Technology Research Center of Shaanxi Province on Intelligent Control and Industrial Big Data Processing, Xi'an, PR China"],"firstName":"Xuefei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085893463"},{"name":"Haotian Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Engineering Technology Research Center of Shaanxi Province on Intelligent Control and Industrial Big Data Processing, Xi'an, PR China"],"firstName":"Haotian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085888138"},{"name":"Zhigang Ren","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Engineering Technology Research Center of Shaanxi Province on Intelligent Control and Industrial Big Data Processing, Xi'an, PR China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085886711"},{"name":"Jiuqiang Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Engineering Technology Research Center of Shaanxi Province on Intelligent Control and Industrial Big Data Processing, Xi'an, PR China"],"firstName":"Jiuqiang","lastName":"Han","id":"37085885583"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727801","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Target tracking","Radar tracking","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Target recognition","ZigBee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","motion control","protocols","radiocommunication","robot vision","rotors","target tracking","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based auxiliary system","multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles","maneuverability","civilian applications","military applications","autonomous rendezvous and docking","ARaD","VAS","multirotor UAV","image acquisition","image processing unit","wireless communication unit","tracking control","docking control unit","continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm","CamShift algorithm","target tracking","Zigbee protocol","status data transmission","six-rotor rotorcrafts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAVs","automatic refueling","tracking","wireless communication","Camshift"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are versatile in maneuverability for both civilian and military applications.

The VAS consists of image acquisition and processing unit, wireless communication unit, and tracking and docking control unit. Continuously adaptive mean shift (CamShift) algorithm was applied for tracking the target and obtaining its 3D coordinates. A specific Zigbee protocol was designed to ensure the steady and rapid transmission of status data between UAVs and the ground station. A straight-forward tracking and docking control algorithm was proposed to assist the rendezvous and docking between the two UAVs. Physical simulation experiments were performed by two six-rotor rotorcrafts, which demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of our proposed vision-based auxiliary system for the future application.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727801","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727801.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","startPage":"4586","endPage":"4592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision-based auxiliary system of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous rendezvous and docking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A vision-based auxiliary system of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous rendezvous and docking","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727801/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446430","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision-based auxiliary system of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous rendezvous and docking","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-629-N-16083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074346S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727803,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Berri","affiliation":["USP - University of S\u00e3o Paulo/ICMC, SSC - LRM (Mobile Robots Lab.), S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Berri","id":"37085499209"},{"name":"Fernando Os\u00f3rio","affiliation":["USP - University of S\u00e3o Paulo/ICMC, SSC - LRM (Mobile Robots Lab.), S\u00e3o Carlos, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Os\u00f3rio","id":"37281539000"},{"name":"Rafael Parpinelli","affiliation":["DCC - CCT Joinville, UDESC - Santa Catarina State University, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Parpinelli","id":"37331197700"},{"name":"Alexandre Silva","affiliation":["UFSC - Federal University of Santa Catarina/INE - CTC Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Silva","id":"37275788900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727803","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular phones","Feature extraction","Skin","Cameras","Automobiles","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","driver information systems","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification","smart phones","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid vision system","mobile phone detecting","driving","frontal camera","driver monitoring","cell phone","car crashes","collision","pattern recognition system","PR system","classification","movement detection system","MD system","classifier selection","ANN","neuron activation function","network training parameters","genetic algorithm","MLP/Gaussian classifier","intermediate layer neurons"]}],"abstract":"In this work, a vision system has been developed using a frontal camera to monitor the driver, enabling to recognize the use of a cell phone while driving. It is estimated that 80% of car crashes and 65% of near collisions involved drivers who were inattentive in traffic for three seconds before the event. Five videos in real environments were generated to test the proposed system. The solution is a hybrid system and that uses a pattern recognition system (PR) for classification and a movement detection system (MD) for choosing the PR parameters at the end of each period of 3 seconds. The PR parameters are the threshold (frames identified as a cell phone use) and classifier selection. The classifiers are based on ANN, furthermore, the value of constants in neuron activation function and network training parameters were adopted with a genetic algorithm. Experimentally, it was established that when the movement indicates a possible use of the cell phone, the threshold 60% and an MLP/Gaussian classifier with seven neurons in intermediate layer are suitable; otherwise, a threshold of 85%, and MLP/Gaussian with two neurons in intermediate layer for classification are used.

Two challenges are encountered in the study, that is, to embed any type of prior information and to select its imposing schemes. The work focuses on the second challenge and studies a new constraint imposing scheme for equality constraints. A new method called locally imposing function (LIF) is proposed to provide a local correction to the GCNN prediction function, which therefore falls within Locally Imposing Scheme (LIS). In comparison, the conventional Lagrange multiplier method is considered as Globally Imposing Scheme (GIS) because its added constraint term exhibits a global impact to its objective function. Two advantages are gained from LIS over GIS. First, LIS enables constraints to fire locally and explicitly in the domain only where they need on the prediction function. Second, constraints can be implemented within a network setting directly. We attempt to interpret several constraint methods graphically from a viewpoint of the locality principle. Numerical examples confirm the advantages of the proposed method. In solving boundary value problems with Dirichlet and Neumann constraints, the GCNN model with LIF is possible to achieve an exact satisfaction of the constraints.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727830","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727830.pdf","startPage":"4795","endPage":"4802","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally imposing function for Generalized Constraint Neural Networks - A study on equality constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Locally imposing function for Generalized Constraint Neural Networks - A study on equality constraints","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446429","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727830/","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally imposing function for Generalized Constraint Neural Networks - A study on equality constraints","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-658-N-16409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134203S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727831,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The McRNN has two components, namely, a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is an evolving single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with Gaussian activation functions. The meta-cognitive component present in McRNN helps to cognitive component in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McRNN employs extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to find optimal network parameters in training. First, the performance of the proposed sequential learning McRNN algorithm has been evaluated using a set of benchmark function approximation problems and is compared with existing sequential learning algorithms. The performance results on these problems show the better performance of McRNN algorithm over the other algorithms. Next, the proposed McRNN algorithm has been applied to RUL estimation problem based on sensor data. For simulation studies, we have used Prognostics Health Management (PHM) 2008 Data Challenge data set and compared with the existing approaches based on state-of-the-art regression algorithms.

In recent years, RBFs have been subject to extensive areas of interests. But the setting up of RBFs in a network architecture can be time consuming, computationally deficient and unstable. Thus we have developed an efficient adaptive algorithm in a feedforward neural architecture in which the hidden neurons are Newton bases. These bases are derived from the RBFs on optimal center points. Unlike the RBFs, the Newton bases are stable and orthonormal in the kernel space. The algorithm is implemented on variably scaled RBFs that simultaneously adjust the shape parameter. The procedure of the training is computationally efficient, accurate and stable in the kernel spaces specially for noisy data set. Numerical modeling for time series shows that our proposed algorithm has very promising performance in compare to some recent approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727832","startPage":"4811","endPage":"4818","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727832.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive learning algorithm for RBF Neural Networks in kernel spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727832/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive learning algorithm for RBF Neural Networks in kernel spaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727832/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16446829","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive learning algorithm for RBF Neural Networks in kernel spaces","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-660-N-16626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098252S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7727839,"authors":[{"name":"Rohitash Chandra","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics Research Group, Software Foundation, Nausori, Fiji"],"firstName":"Rohitash","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37085378017"},{"name":"Ratneel Deo","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics Research Group, Software Foundation, Nausori, Fiji","School of Computing Information and Mathematical Sciences, University of South Pacific, Suva, Fiji"],"firstName":"Ratneel","lastName":"Deo","id":"37085795776"},{"name":"Christian W.

PID controllers are still used in many process systems. However, if systems exhibit nonlinearity, PID controllers with fixed PID parameters cannot achieve a desired control performance when a system's equilibrium points are changed by set point changes. To solve this problem, the DD-PID controller was proposed. The DD-PID controller can maintain good control performance for nonlinear systems because it learns the PID parameters in its database so that the control performance around each equilibrium point has a desired characteristic. In this research, a fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT) method is applied as the learning method of the DD-PID controller. This method can perform offline learning and obtain a desired tracking property of a closed-loop system by storing one-shot operating data given by a PID controller with fixed PID parameters into a database using the concept of the FRIT. This paper also shows that the DD-PID controller can achieve good control performance for unlearned system changes and disturbances by performing online learning with the same criterion used in offline learning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PD control","Databases","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","learning (artificial intelligence)","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning algorithm","data-driven controller","fictitious reference iterative tuning","DD-PID controller","proportional-integral-derivative controller","control parameter tuning","closed-loop system","FRIT method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727845","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727845.pdf","startPage":"4908","endPage":"4913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A learning algorithm for a data-driven controller based on fictitious reference iterative tuning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A learning algorithm for a data-driven controller based on fictitious reference iterative tuning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727845/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727845/","accessionNumber":"16446821","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning algorithm for a data-driven controller based on fictitious reference iterative tuning","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-673-N-16457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055159S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7727850,"authors":[{"name":"Vignesh Narayanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Vignesh","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"37085609582"},{"name":"S.

Thus, the primary concern is not to forecast load with a novel model, rather to forecast load with the highest accuracy. Short-term load forecast accuracy is often hindered due to various load impacting factors. Two of the major impacting factors are day-ahead weather forecast and subsequent variation in electricity demand that is independent of weather. To tackle the uncertainty in short-term load forecasting, this paper presents a neural network-based load forecasting technique for short-term horizon based on data corresponding to a U.S. independent system operator.

The brain damage can be detected using brain volume and whole brain form. The correlation between brain shrinkage and reduction of brain volume can affect to deformation texture. In this research, the enhancement texture approach was proposed, called advanced local binary pattern (ALBP) method. ALBP is introduced as a 2D and 3D feature extraction descriptor. In the ALBP, sign and magnitude value were introduced as an enhancement to the previous LBP method. Due to a great number of features are produced by ALBP, the principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis are used as feature selection method. Furthermore, SVM classifier is applied for multiclass classification including Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, and normal condition of whole brain and hippocampus. The experimental results from two scenarios (ALBP sign magnitude (2D) and ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes (3D) methods) show better accuracy and performance compare to previous method. Our proposed method achieved the average value of accuracy between 80% - 100% for both the whole brain and hippocampus data. In addition, uniform rotation invariant ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes as a 3D descriptor also outperforms other approaches with an average accuracy of 96.28% for multiclass classifications for whole brain image.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727865","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727865.pdf","startPage":"5051","endPage":"5056","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Alzheimer's disease using advanced local binary pattern from hippocampus and whole brain of MR images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Alzheimer's disease using advanced local binary pattern from hippocampus and whole brain of MR images","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727865/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446558","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Alzheimer's disease using advanced local binary pattern from hippocampus and whole brain of MR images","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-693-N-16196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062216S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727866,"authors":[{"name":"Bahareh Pourbabaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Bahareh","lastName":"Pourbabaee","id":"37079055100"},{"name":"Mehrsan Javan Roshtkhari","affiliation":["SPORTLOGiQ, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehrsan Javan","lastName":"Roshtkhari","id":"37889137300"},{"name":"Khashayar Khorasani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Khashayar","lastName":"Khorasani","id":"37085439212"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727866","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":915},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Electrocardiography","Convolution","Learning systems","Hidden Markov models","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","diseases","electrocardiography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification","signal representation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature leaning","deep convolutional neural networks","patients screening","paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","electrocardiogram","ECG signal classification","PAF","life threatening cardiac arrhythmia","representative features","time domain ECG signals","CNN","feature extraction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification and patient screening method is developed. The focus is on identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) which is a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach uses the raw ECG signal as the input and automatically learns the representative features for PAF to be used by a classification mechanism. The features are learned directly from the time domain ECG signals by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one fully connected layer. The learned features can replace the hand-crafted features and our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the learned features in patient screening. The experimental results indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an End-to-End convolutional neural network classifier. The major characteristics of the proposed approach are to simplify the process of feature extraction for different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to specify the appropriate features. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG classification method is demonstrated through performing extensive simulation studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature leaning with deep Convolutional Neural Networks for screening patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727866","startPage":"5057","endPage":"5064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727866.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Feature leaning with deep Convolutional Neural Networks for screening patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727866/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446606","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature leaning with deep Convolutional Neural Networks for screening patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-694-N-16338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090528S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727873,"authors":[{"name":"Demetrio Ferro","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications dpt., Polytechnic of Turin, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Demetrio","lastName":"Ferro","id":"37085889519"},{"name":"Vincent Gripon","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, UMR CNRS Lab-STICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Gripon","id":"37591295000"},{"name":"Xiaoran Jiang","affiliation":["INRIA, Centre Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Xiaoran","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086048032"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727873","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Artificial neural networks","Associative memory","Euclidean distance","Acceleration","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data analysis","neural nets","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nearest neighbour search","binary neural networks","product quantization","binary neural associative memories","TEXMEX SIFT1M database","MNIST database","search complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727873","abstract":"The problem of finding nearest neighbours in terms of Euclidean distance, Hamming distance or other distance metric is a very common operation in computer vision and pattern recognition.

In this method, face descriptors are represented through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and formalized as information granules. Moreover, neural networks are used to construct efficient classifiers. Furthermore, with usage of AHP we realize a transition from the linguistic description of the facial features to the vectors of numbers that are used by a neural network in the process of matching faces. The results of experiments demonstrate the potential applicability of our proposal to the forensic investigations. Finally, discussed are important aspects of constructing neural networks regarded as a vehicle to perform classification process.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727877","startPage":"5135","endPage":"5140","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727877.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition by humans performed on basis of linguistic descriptors and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Pragmatics","Face recognition","Shape","Neural networks","Facial features","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic hierarchy process","face recognition","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","linguistic descriptors","neural networks","face classification","face descriptors","analytic hierarchy process","AHP","information granules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","neural network","linguistic descriptors","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition by humans performed on basis of linguistic descriptors and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727877/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition by humans performed on basis of linguistic descriptors and neural networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-705-N-16625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07374S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7727885,"authors":[{"name":"Motonobu Hattori","affiliation":["Faculty of Interdisciplinary Research, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Motonobu","lastName":"Hattori","id":"37333564400"},{"name":"Yoshinori Kobayashi","affiliation":["Faculty of Interdisciplinary Research, University of Yamanashi, Kofu, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37085893549"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727885","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Hippocampus","Context","Context modeling","Timing","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hippocampal model","neurogenesis","asymmetric STDP","temporal context","higher-order information processing","thinking","reasoning","episodic memory model","physiological findings","temporal pattern sequence","plural temporal sequences","one-to-many association","one-to-many context","dentate gyrus","asymmetric spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity","recurrent collateral learning","computer simulation","complex temporal sequences"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727885","abstract":"Our memory is first acquired as memory of a personal event (episodic memory). Then, its temporal context is removed and the resultant memory is used in higher-order information processing, such as thinking, reasoning and so on. Therefore, episodic memory is the basis of our memories. In this paper, we propose an episodic memory model which adopts the physiological findings of the hippocampus. Episodic memory can be regarded as a temporal sequence of patterns. In general, such a sequence may have some patterns which appear several times in it, or plural temporal sequences may share some same patterns with each other. That is, it is indispensable for the episodic memory model to handle one-to-many association and context. In the proposed model, the neurogenesis in dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to build different representations in CA3 for the same input patterns, and facilitates one-to-many association. Moreover, the asymmetric spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity introduced to the learning of recurrent collateral in CA3 enables memory of context. Computer simulation results show that the proposed model can deal with complex temporal sequences.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727885","startPage":"5189","endPage":"5193","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7593175/7726591/07727885.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7726591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hippocampal model for episodic memory using neurogenesis and asymmetric STDP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A hippocampal model for episodic memory using neurogenesis and asymmetric STDP","conferenceDate":"24-29 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7727885/","accessionNumber":"16446819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727885/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hippocampal model for episodic memory using neurogenesis and asymmetric STDP","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"RP-713-N-17040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054808S","chronDate":"24-29 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7593175","isNumber":"7726591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7593175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7726591","articleId":"7727885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7727892,"authors":[{"name":"Etienne Dumesnil","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 duQu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Etienne","lastName":"Dumesnil","id":"37085474777"},{"name":"Philippe-Olivier Beaulieu","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 duQu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Philippe-Olivier","lastName":"Beaulieu","id":"37085839118"},{"name":"Mounir Boukadoum","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 duQu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Boukadoum","id":"37276338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0620-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0619-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0621-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"7727892","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Field programmable gate arrays","Robots","Computer architecture","Adaptation models","Integrated circuit modeling","Firing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","learning systems","neurocontrollers","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic implementation","operant conditioning","classical conditioning","single STDP learning process","animal world","CC","OC","spike-timing-dependent-plasticity","spiking neural network","SNN","field-programmable gate array","FPGA","Synapto-dendritic kernel adapting neuron model","SKAN model","neuronal architectures","very large scale time-dependent parallel data analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operant conditioning","classical conditioning","habituation","SNN","STDP","SKAN","FPGA","robot","adaptation","learning"]}],"abstract":"A robot is presented whose behavior is based on two fundamental types of learning in the animal world: Classical Conditioning (CC) and Operant Conditioning (OC).

The robot was designed to use the CC and OC neuronal architectures proposed in this paper and was tested in a dynamic environment, which consisted of a maze with changing features.

To this end, we investigate the feasibility of recording the electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, and EEG from face-lead locations, by embedding multiple electrodes within a standard helmet. The electrode positions are at the lower jaw, mastoids, and forehead, while for validation purposes a respiration belt around the thorax and a reference ECG from the chest serve as ground truth to assess the performance. The within-helmet EEG is verified by exposing the subjects to periodic visual and auditory stimuli and screening the recordings for the steady-state evoked potentials in response to these stimuli. Cycling and walking are chosen as real-world activities to illustrate how to deal with the so-induced irregular motion artifacts, which contaminate the recordings. We also propose a multivariate R-peak detection algorithm suitable for such noisy environments. Recordings in real-world scenarios support a proof of concept of the feasibility of recording vital signs and EEG from the proposed smart helmet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","volume":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16470647","pubMedId":"27957405","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727932/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"externalId":"2700111","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smart Helmet: Wearable Multichannel ECG and EEG","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000833","fundingName":"Rosetrees Trust"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/K025643"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Smart Helmet: Wearable Multichannel ECG and EEG","sourcePdf":"jtehm-vonrosenberg-2609927-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096097S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"7360970","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7360970","articleId":"7727932","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727933,"authors":[{"name":"Jihwan Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7727933/moon-2623627-small.gif","p":["Jihwan Moon (S\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2014 and 2016, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical Engineering.

In our system, the H-AP first transmits an energy signal to recharge the batteries of the EH users and the EH jammer in the energy transfer (ET) phase. Then, in the subsequent information transfer (IT) phase, each user sends information to the H-AP in a time division multiple access manner, while the jammer generates jamming signals to interfere the eavesdroppers. We adopt two different secrecy performance measurements according to the level of channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers. First, with a single user, we maximize the secrecy rate by optimizing the time allocation between the ET and the IT phase when perfect CSI of the eavesdroppers is available at all nodes. In contrast, when the instantaneous CSI of the eavesdroppers is not available at legitimate nodes, we analyze and minimize the secrecy outage probability. We also extend the single user analysis to a more general multi-user situation with an additional consideration of the transmit power allocation at the jammer. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed solutions through simulations and demonstrate that a performance gain compared to conventional schemes becomes more pronounced with the increased number of eavesdroppers and users.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623627","startPage":"764","endPage":"774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07727933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Performance Optimization for Wireless Powered Communication Networks With an Energy Harvesting Jammer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Performance Optimization for Wireless Powered Communication Networks With an Energy Harvesting Jammer","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669124","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7727933/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) of Korea Government","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A1A10049769"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"NRF funded by the MISP of Korea Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1C1A1A02036927"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Performance Optimization for Wireless Powered Communication Networks With an Energy Harvesting Jammer","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lee-2623627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108845S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7727933","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727935,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Rezaee-Alam","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems,\u00a0School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Farhad","lastName":"Rezaee-Alam","id":"37085752478"},{"name":"Behrooz Rezaeealam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lorestan University, Lorestan 68137-17133, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Rezaeealam","id":"37550736000"},{"name":"Jawad Faiz","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems,\u00a0School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Faiz","id":"37272819800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"7727935","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":869},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Air gaps","Rotors","Saturation magnetization","Atmospheric modeling","Analytical models","Magnetic flux","Magnetic separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","magnetic forces","permanent magnet motors","rotors","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unbalanced magnetic force analysis","conformal mapping method","UMF analysis","eccentric surface-mounted permanent magnet motor","SMPM motor","on-load air gap field component","Maxwell stress tensor method","ICM method","magnetic local traction on-load component","UMF","initial eccentricity angle","mixed rotor eccentricity","dynamic rotor eccentricity","static rotor eccentricity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic eccentricity (DE)","improved conformal mapping (ICM)","magnetic field","magnetic saturation","mixed eccentricity (ME)","permanent magnet (PM)","static eccentricity (SE)"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces an improved conformal mapping (ICM) method for the calculation and analysis of unbalanced magnetic force (UMF) in eccentric surface-mounted permanent-magnet (SMPM) motors considering the static, dynamic, and mixed rotor eccentricities.

The other purpose of this paper is to illustrate the difference between the influences of static, dynamic, and mixed rotor eccentricities on the UMF using the ICM method. The influence of initial eccentricity angle and the magnitude of eccentricity on the UMF are also investigated under the static, dynamic, and mixed rotor eccentricities. The predicted results obtained through ICM are verified by comparing with the corresponding results obtained through finite element method and the frozen permeability method. The ICM method is also validated by the experiment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbalanced Magnetic Force Analysis in Eccentric Surface Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2016.2623566","startPage":"146","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2016.2623566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7866903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7866903/07727935.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Unbalanced Magnetic Force Analysis in Eccentric Surface Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7727935/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16707639","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbalanced Magnetic Force Analysis in Eccentric Surface Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","sourcePdf":"tec-rezaeealam-2623566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067408S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7866903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7866903","articleId":"7727935","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7727936,"authors":[{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems and the Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7776999/7727936/liu-2618978-small.gif","p":["Huaping Liu is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the tightness of Jensen's bounds has not yet been rigorously quantified in the general MIMO context. This paper proposes a new methodology for measuring the tightness of Jensen's bounds via the sandwich theorem. In particular, we first compare the tightness of two different pairs of upper/lower bounds for a general class of MIMO channels based on the unordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous correlation matrix and for arbitrary numbers of antennas. The tightness of Jensen's bounds in different channel scenarios is investigated including multiuser MIMO with maximal ratio combining. Our analysis is facilitated by deriving some new results for finite-dimensional Wishart matrices, i.e., for the arbitrary moments of the unordered eigenvalue of central and non-central Wishart matrices. Our results provide very interesting insights into the implications of the system parameters, such as the number of antennas, and signal-to-noise ratio, on the tightness of Jensen's bounds, and showcase the suitability and limitations of Jensen's bounds.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623945","startPage":"579","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07727938.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tightness of Jensen\u2019s Bounds and Applications to MIMO Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tightness of Jensen\u2019s Bounds and Applications to MIMO Communications","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16669133","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7727938/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSFC) for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61625106"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61531011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tightness of Jensen\u2019s Bounds and Applications to MIMO Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yuan-2623945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155436S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7727938","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727946,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Delibalta","affiliation":["Design, Technology and Society Program, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Delibalta","id":"37085495599"},{"name":"Kaan Gokcesu","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kaan","lastName":"Gokcesu","id":"37085826105"},{"name":"Mustafa Simsek","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Simsek","id":"37085906384"},{"name":"Lemi Baruh","affiliation":["Design, Technology and Society Program, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Lemi","lastName":"Baruh","id":"37085904446"},{"name":"Suleyman S.

At each time, the algorithm makes a new observation, produces a decision, and then adaptively updates all its parameters to enhance its performance. The algorithm mainly works in an unsupervised manner since in most real-life applications labeling the data is costly. Even so, whenever there is a feedback, the algorithm uses it for better adaptation. The algorithm has two stages. In the first stage, it constructs a score function similar to a probability density function to model the underlying nominal distribution (if there is one) or to fit to the observed data. In the second state, this score function is used to evaluate the newly observed data to provide the final decision. The decision is given after the well-known thresholding. We construct the score using a highly versatile and completely adaptive nested decision tree. Nested soft decision trees are used to partition the observation space in a hierarchical manner. We adaptively optimize every component of the tree, i.e., decision regions and probabilistic models at each node as well as the overall structure, based on the sequential performance. This extensive in-time adaptation provides strong modeling capabilities; however, it may cause overfitting. To mitigate the overfitting issues, we first use the intermediate nodes of the tree to produce several subtrees, which constitute all the models from coarser to full extend, and then adaptively combine them. By using a real-life dataset, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7604153/07727946.pdf","startPage":"1867","endPage":"1871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2623773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2623773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection With Nested Trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Decision trees","Tree data structures","Signal processing algorithms","Semisupervised learning","Intrusion detection","Statistical learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","security of data","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection","probabilistic models","decision regions","nested soft decision trees","adaptive nested decision tree","nominal distribution","probability density function","score function","online anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection","semisupervised learning","statistical learning","tree data structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection With Nested Trees","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7727946/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16490814","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences Outstanding Researcher Programme"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Anomaly Detection With Nested Trees","sourcePdf":"lsp-kozat-2623773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067114S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7604153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7604153","articleId":"7727946","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7727947,"authors":[{"name":"Beom Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/7762313/7727947/kwon-2617294-small.gif","p":["Beom Kwon was born in South Korea, in 1989.

To achieve this goal, we use two different prototype filters to satisfy the orthogonality conditions for even and odd subcarriers. Orthogonality conditions cannot, in practice, be guaranteed using only two filters because they generate residual interference, including intercarrier and intersymbol interference, which makes it difficult to obtain accurate channel coefficients at reference symbols and leads to degraded channel estimation and bit error rates (BERs). To reduce the influence of residual interference on channel estimation, we model residual interference in a closed form over a multipath channel. Based on this approximated residual interference, the interference is effectively cancelled with respect to the reference, thereby significantly improving the FBMC/QAM-based eMBMS performance. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method improves the mean squared error, BER, and the effective data rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Interference Cancellation and Channel Estimation in Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast System Using Filter-Bank Multicarrier-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2016.2617294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7762313/07727947.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2016.2617294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Interference Cancellation and Channel Estimation in Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast System Using Filter-Bank Multicarrier-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7727947/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16518979","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A2A10011764"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Interference Cancellation and Channel Estimation in Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast System Using Filter-Bank Multicarrier-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation","sourcePdf":"tbc-lee-2617294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105995S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7762313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7762313","articleId":"7727947","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7727952,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7727952/guo-2624119-small.gif","p":["Kun Guo received the B.E. degree in telecommunications engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems.

In C-RAN, due to the high amount of data transfer from the BBU pool to RRHs through fronthauls, limited fronthaul capacity becomes a key factor when designing cooperative transmission schemes among RRHs. Meanwhile, as computational resources are provisioned to mobile users (MUs) for baseband processing in the form of virtual machines (VMs) in the BBU pool, an effective VM assignment strategy is also with great significance. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for green C-RAN under the constraint of limited fronthaul capacity, where we jointly optimize hybrid clustering and computation provisioning to appropriately provide a cluster of RRHs and a VM to each MU for cooperative transmission and baseband processing, aiming at minimizing the system power consumption. The system power minimization problem is formulated as an integer non-linear programming problem, which is hard to tackle. For tractability purpose, we transform this problem to an equivalent hybrid clustering problem embedded with a series of VM assignment problems. On this basis, we first achieve the optimal solution for system power minimization with high computational complexity, and then, a greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the hybrid clustering problem for practical implementation. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization of hybrid clustering and computation provisioning can significantly reduce the system power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07727952.pdf","startPage":"4063","endPage":"4076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Hybrid Clustering and Computation Provisioning for Green C-RAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Green communications","Hybrid power systems","Cloud computing","Energy efficiency","Array signal processing","Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","cooperative communication","greedy algorithms","pattern clustering","power consumption","radio access networks","telecommunication power management","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","greedy algorithm","computational complexity","nonlinear programming problem","VM assignment strategy","virtual machine","mobile user","cooperative transmission scheme","fronthaul capacity","data transfer","RRH","remote radio head","cloud radio access network","BBU pool","centralized cloud-based baseband unit pool","baseband processing functionalities","green C-RAN","computation provisioning","hybrid clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud radio access network (C-RAN)","computation provisioning","cooperative transmission","hybrid clustering","limited fronthaul capacity","power saving","virtual machine (VM) assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Hybrid Clustering and Computation Provisioning for Green C-RAN","volume":"34","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7727952/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581244","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231008, 91638202 and 91338114"},{"fundingName":"863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001022-003"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-ZJU Research Collaboration","grantNumber":"SUTD-ZJU/RES/01/2014"},{"fundingName":"MOE ARF Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-002 and MOE2015-T2-2-104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Hybrid Clustering and Computation Provisioning for Green C-RAN","sourcePdf":"jsac-guo-2624119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146634S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7727952","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7727953,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A detailed theoretical analysis is given and used to optimize the superstrate size and the air gap height between the antenna and superstrate layer. The proposed DRA is designed, simulated, implemented, and tested. The high gain CP DRA has the potential to be used for millimeter wave wireless communication and imaging systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16521232","htmlLink":"/document/7727953/","displayDocTitle":"Gain Enhancement of Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna Based on FSS Superstrate for MMW Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain Enhancement of Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna Based on FSS Superstrate for MMW Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-akbari-2623655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055283S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7769172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7769172","articleId":"7727953","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7727954,"authors":[{"name":"Te-Hsuan Chen","affiliation":["Synopsys, Mountain View, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8657702/7727954/chen-2623796-small.gif","p":["TE-HSUAN CHEN (S\u201907) received the BSc and MSc degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, and the PhD degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in computer science and engineering, in 2016.

It implements arith-metic operations by extremely simple and low-power hardware. Despite major new applications, various aspects of SC's theory and design requirements are poorly understood. We observe that the Boolean functions used in SC take the form \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$f(X)\\;= \\;f(X_{{\\mathrm{V}}};X_{{\\mathrm{C}}})$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n, where \n<i>X</i>\n<sub>V</sub>\n and \n<i>X</i>\n<sub>C</sub>\n are inputs with variable and constant probabilities, respectively. Different functions can be equivalent in the sense of implying the same stochastic behavior. We define stochastic equivalence classes (SECs) based on the \n<i>X</i>\n<sub>V</sub>\n; \n<i>X</i>\n<sub>C</sub>\n partition, and explore their properties and applications. Suitably interpreted, SECs define all realizable arithmetic functions of interest. While conventional synthesis focuses on finding the best \n<i>circuit</i>\n to implement a known arithmetic function \n<i>F</i>\n, stochastic circuit optimization first requires finding the best logic \n<i>function f</i>\n that realizes \n<i>F</i>\n. We present an algorithm \n<i>ESECS</i>\n (extended SEC-based synthesis) for this problem, which includes a new stochastic circuit optimization process analogous to conventional two-level logic optimization. \n<i>ESECS</i>\n demonstrates the computational richness of SC and leads to major cost reductions compared to prior designs.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2016.2623796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8657702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2016.2623796","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8657702/07727954.pdf","startPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalence Among Stochastic Logic Circuits and its Application to Synthesis","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245516/8657702/7727954-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727954/","displayDocTitle":"Equivalence Among Stochastic Logic Circuits and its Application to Synthesis","volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7727954/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1318091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Equivalence Among Stochastic Logic Circuits and its Application to Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tetc-chen-2623796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085795S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8657702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8657702","articleId":"7727954","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7727959,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Fractional Signals and Systems, Beijing, China","School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7727959/yang-2624078-small.gif","p":["Kai Yang (M\u201912) received the B.E. degree in communications engineering from the National University of Defense Technology and Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.

We consider both the total energy efficiency (EE) and individual EE optimization problems, which are fractional programming and generalized fractional programming problems, respectively, and are hard to tackle due to their non-concave nature. We first transform them into equivalent optimization problems in parametric subtractive forms, which fit in a class of non-concave optimization methods known as difference of two concave functions programming, and then solve them using Dinkelbach and branch-and-bound methods to give global optimal solutions. Due to the unaffordable complexity of the global optimal solution, we further propose sub-optimal schemes through adding constraints on the interferences to convert the non-concave problems into concave ones and to give sub-optimal solutions with reasonable complexity. The sub-optimal solution gives a tight lower bound on the optimal EE. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07727959.pdf","startPage":"3208","endPage":"3220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Control for Device-to-Device Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Power Control for Device-to-Device Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727959/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16581246","htmlLink":"/document/7727959/","volume":"34","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Power Control for Device-to-Device Communications","sourcePdf":"jsac-yang-2624078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157842S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7727959","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727967,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37673612500"},{"name":"Qianwei Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qianwei","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-5012-8235","id":"37086012222"},{"name":"Shunfu Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shunfu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085888290"},{"name":"X.

The purpose of D2D Fogging is to achieve energy efficient task executions for network wide users. To this end, we propose an optimization problem formulation that aims at minimizing the time-average energy consumption for task executions of all users, meanwhile taking into account the incentive constraints of preventing the over-exploiting and free-riding behaviors which harm user's motivation for collaboration. To overcome the challenge that future system information such as user resource availability is difficult to predict, we develop an online task offloading algorithm, which leverages Lyapunov optimization methods and utilizes the current system information only. As the critical building block, we devise corresponding efficient task scheduling policies in terms of three kinds of system settings in a time frame. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online algorithm not only achieves superior performance (e.g., it reduces approximately 30% ~ 40% energy consumption compared with user local execution), but also adapts to various situations in terms of task type, user amount, and task frequency.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas

As an example, we have used an RL configuration. However, it is clear that the phenomenon occurs in any other configuration governed by the same type of evolution equation. The main result is that the phenomenon occurs with a quadratic colored noise. When noise enters only linearly we have verified that the SR occurs both with colored noise and white noise. The robustness of our results were verified by calculating the variance as a function of time in each case.

When observed from the input radio frequency (RF) port of the passive mixer, the impedance exhibits bandpass filtering characteristics centered around the frequency of the local oscillator (LO) signal. The theory of baseband impedance up-conversion is widely accepted in the analysis of passive mixer circuits as well as in describing the origin of this bandpass impedance characteristics. In this paper, we revisit this theory and show that it is not always accurate since it does not account for switching transients. We begin our work by showing that the most commonly used single-balanced mixer is not the right choice for a half-circuit used in analyzing the input impedance of a fully-balanced passive mixer. We propose an alternative half-circuit, and proceed with a novel analysis that accounts for switching transients. This switching-aware analysis allows capturing the switched-capacitor behavior of the passive mixer. We then derive closed-form equations for the mixer impedance using purely-capacitive loads as well as resistive-capacitive (RC) loads. We also discuss the impact of finite LO rise and fall times on the mixer impedance. Simulation results of quadrature passive mixers using ideal and MOSFET switches show very close match with the proposed theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2613118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7835743/07727993.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7835743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2613118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Analysis of Passive Mixer Impedance: A Switched-Capacitor Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7727993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Analysis of Passive Mixer Impedance: A Switched-Capacitor Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727993/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16637916","htmlLink":"/document/7727993/","volume":"64","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Analysis of Passive Mixer Impedance: A Switched-Capacitor Approach","sourcePdf":"tcsi-atalla-2613118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097121S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7835743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7835743","articleId":"7727993","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727995,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxiang Xie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7727995/xie-2623772-small.gif","p":["Hongxiang Xie (S\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

To embrace its potential gains, the acquisition of channel state information is crucial, which unfortunately faces a number of challenges, such as the uplink pilot contamination, the overhead of downlink training and feedback, and the computational complexity. In order to reduce the effective channel dimensions, researchers have been investigating the low-rank (sparse) properties of channel environments from different viewpoints. This paper then provides a general overview of the current low-rank channel estimation approaches, including their basic assumptions, key results, as well as pros and cons on addressing the aforementioned tricky challenges. Comparisons among all these methods are provided for better understanding and some future research prospects for these low-rank approaches are also forecasted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7727995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","volume":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16470549","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7727995/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Low-Rank Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422109, 61531011 and 61625106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Overview of Low-Rank Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-xie-2623772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081203S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7727995","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7727996,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Sequeira","affiliation":["CeNITEQ Group, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Arquitectura, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Sequeira","orcid":"0000-0003-0182-0652","id":"38468896400"},{"name":"Juan Luis de la Cruz","affiliation":["CeNITEQ Group, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Arquitectura, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Luis","lastName":"de la Cruz","id":"37085642610"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Ruiz-Mas","affiliation":["CeNITEQ Group, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Arquitectura, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Ruiz-Mas","id":"38270873700"},{"name":"Jose Saldana","affiliation":["CeNITEQ Group, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Arquitectura, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Saldana","orcid":"0000-0002-6977-6363","id":"38275641300"},{"name":"Juli\u00e1n Fernandez-Navajas","affiliation":["CeNITEQ Group, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Arquitectura, Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Juli\u00e1n","lastName":"Fernandez-Navajas","id":"38273424700"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Almodovar","affiliation":["Networks Department, TNO, The Hague, JE, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Almodovar","id":"37086014570"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7727996","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1346},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standard","Real-time systems","Wireless LAN","Scalability","Wireless networks","Handover"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","quality of service","real-time systems","software defined networking","telecommunication network reliability","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN enterprise WLAN","virtual AP","virtual access points","Wi-Fi solution","QoS","seamless handovers","real-time services","scalability issues","beacon generation","channel assignment","packet loss","packet delay","software defined networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enterprise WLAN","seamless handoff","SDN"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the development and testing of an open enterprise Wi-Fi solution based on virtual access points (APs), managed by a central WLAN controller is presented.

Unfortunately, it is prone to the laser phase noise (PN) that results in significant inter-subcarrier interference due to the loss of OQAM orthogonality. Based on the analysis of the OQAM constellation obtained at the output of the analysis filter bank, we propose a modified blind phase search algorithm working based on the observation of all subcarriers simultaneously. It efficiently compensates for the PN and incurs a low number of multiplications. The proposed method is analytically derived and numerically validated with 4-, 16-, and 64-OQAM modulations. The impact of the number of subcarriers used per optical channel is also investigated. The results show that up to 256 subcarriers can be utilized with negligible performance degradation.

After cosputtering an ITO target with N2 as the insulator and capping the same ITO material as the top electrode, the device exhibits rectifier and resistance switching characteristics before and after the forming process, respectively. The Schottky diodelike rectifier mechanism was also verified by various temperature measurements. Furthermore, robust resistance switching at a positive forming voltage, smaller than that required during negative bias forming, can be achieved. Both positive and negative forming processes are examined with current fitting results, which show different dominant mechanisms when using positive or negative biases. All these mechanisms have also been verified by temperature effect experiments, which confirmed the dominant conduction mechanisms. This, in combination with the fact that the positive forming voltage itself is smaller than the negative forming voltage, and decreases with device scale down, provides two highly beneficial results. This good performance achieved by using ITO with N2 suggests significant progress of RRAM and remarkable potential applications.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2016.2619704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7739934/07728002.pdf","startPage":"4769","endPage":"4775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7739934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2016.2619704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obtaining Lower Forming Voltage and Self-Compliance Current by Using a Nitride Gas/Indium\u2013Tin Oxide Insulator in Resistive Random Access Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Obtaining Lower Forming Voltage and Self-Compliance Current by Using a Nitride Gas/Indium\u2013Tin Oxide Insulator in Resistive Random Access Memory","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728002/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16486059","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST-103-2112-M-110-011-MY3"},{"fundingName":"NSYSU-NUK Joint Research Project","grantNumber":"NSYSUNUK 105-I002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obtaining Lower Forming Voltage and Self-Compliance Current by Using a Nitride Gas/Indium\u2013Tin Oxide Insulator in Resistive Random Access Memory","sourcePdf":"ted-chang-2619704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162229S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7739934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7739934","articleId":"7728002","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728004,"authors":[{"name":"Angelo Cenedese","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Padua, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7728004/cened-2623702-small.gif","p":["Angelo Cenedese (M\u201912) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Padua, Padua, Italy, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.

The proposed strategy, which exploits the opportunities offered by the IEEE 802.3az amendment to the Ethernet standard (known as energy efficient Ethernet) is based on the possibility of predicting the future traffic from the analysis of the current data flow. In agreement with the results of such a dynamic prediction, Ethernet links can be forced into a low power consumption state for variable intervals. Theoretical bounds are derived to detail how the performance figures depend on the parameters of the designed strategy and scale with respect to traffic load. Furthermore, simulation results carried out with both real and synthetic traffic traces are presented to prove the effectiveness of the strategy, which leads to considerable energy savings at the cost of only a limited bounded delay in data delivery.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07728004.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy Efficient Ethernet Strategy Based on Traffic Prediction and Shaping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Ethernet Strategy Based on Traffic Prediction and Shaping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728004/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16598304","htmlLink":"/document/7728004/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient Ethernet Strategy Based on Traffic Prediction and Shaping","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cenedese-2623702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144001S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7728004","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7728007,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7728007/zhang-2623758-small.gif","p":["Yuan Zhang (S\u201916) is currently pursuing his bachelor\u2019s degree of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from 2013.

However, most of existing works only optimize the EE in the single-cell scenario, while little attention is paid to maximizing the EE of the whole cellular network underlaid with D2D communication with randomly distributed users on multiple bands. In this paper, we first consider the whole cellular network underlaid with D2D communication on multiple bands and derive the exact expressions of the successful transmission probabilities, the average sum rate and the EE based on stochastic geometry theory. Then, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the EE subject to four constraints regarding to transmission power and outage probabilities, and the non-convexity of this problem is also verified. After that, by exploiting the objective function property of being the sum of several functions, we propose a derivative-based algorithm to solve this non-convex optimization problem. Our theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the conventional branch and bound algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal EE with much better performance than the conventional algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","publicationDate":"2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728007/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16470578","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Maximization for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks on Multiple Bands","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2015DFG12760"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Efficiency Maximization for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks on Multiple Bands","sourcePdf":"access-dai-2623758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064306S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7728007","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7728009,"authors":[{"name":"Xubo Zhao","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China","College of Science, China University of Petroleum (Huadong), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xubo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38244428300"},{"name":"Xiaoping Li","affiliation":["College of Science, China University of Petroleum (Huadong), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoping","lastName":"Li","id":"37086152536"},{"name":"Tongjiang Yan","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China","College of Science, China University of Petroleum (Huadong), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Tongjiang","lastName":"Yan","id":"38112549700"},{"name":"Rengang Shi","affiliation":["College of Science, China University of Petroleum (Huadong), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Rengang","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085658806"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7728009","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Delays","Encoding","Receivers","Packet loss","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","linear codes","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random linear coding schemes","exact decoding delay distribution expressions","lossy channel","special matrices","polynomial basis representation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random linear coding","decoding delay probability distribution","lossy channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07728009.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2623299","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2623299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for the Decoding Delay Distributions of Random Linear Coding Schemes","abstract":"In this letter, we introduce a new technique for deriving the exact decoding delay distribution expressions of random linear coding schemes over a lossy channel.

Last, the decoding delay distribution issues can be solved by employing the polynomial basis representation method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"21","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16668391","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7728009/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Method for the Decoding Delay Distributions of Random Linear Coding Schemes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61301243"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Fund of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2014FQ005 and ZR2015AL006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"15CX02060A, 15CX02056A, 15CX08011A, 15CX05060A, 15CX02074A and 16CX02017A"},{"fundingName":"Fujian Provincial Key Lab. of Network Security and Cryptology Research Fund","grantNumber":"15002"},{"fundingName":"Qingdao application research on special independent innovation plan project","grantNumber":"16-5-1-5-jch"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for the Decoding Delay Distributions of Random Linear Coding Schemes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhao-2623299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057598S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7728009","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7728010,"authors":[{"name":"Samiran Bag","affiliation":["Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7921660/7728010/bag-2623588-small.gif","p":["Samiran Bag received the M.Tech degree in computer science from the Indian Statistical Institute, and the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Statistical Institute.

We analyze the strategies of a selfish Bitcoin miner who in connivance with one pool attacks another pool and receives reward from the former mining pool for attacking the latter. We name this attack as \u201csponsored block withholding attack.\u201d We present detailed quantitative analysis of the monetary incentive that a selfish miner can earn by adopting this strategy under different scenarios. We prove that under certain conditions, the attacker can maximize her revenue by adopting some strategies and by utilizing her computing power wisely. We also show that an attacker may use this strategy for attacking both the pools for earning higher amount of incentives. More importantly, we present a strategy that can effectively counter block withholding attack in any mining pool. First, we propose a generic scheme that uses cryptographic commitment schemes to counter BWH attack. Then, we suggest an alternative implementation of the same scheme using hash function. Our scheme protects a pool from rogue miners as well as rogue pool administrators. The scheme and its variant defend against BWH attack by making it impossible for the miners to distinguish between a partial proof of work and a complete proof of work. The scheme is so designed that the administrator cannot cheat on the entire pool. The scheme can be implemented by making minor changes to existing Bitcoin protocol. We also analyze the security of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2016.2623588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2623588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7921660/07728010.pdf","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bitcoin Block Withholding Attack: Analysis and Mitigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Bitcoin Block Withholding Attack: Analysis and Mitigation","volume":"12","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"16904909","htmlLink":"/document/7728010/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan, and the Department of Science and Technology, India, under the Japan-India Science Cooperative Program of Research Project named: Computational Aspects of Mathematical Design and Analysis of Secure Communication Systems Based on Cryptographic Primitives"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research","grantNumber":"KAKEN-15H02711"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bitcoin Block Withholding Attack: Analysis and Mitigation","sourcePdf":"tifs-bag-2623588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065486S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7921660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7921660","articleId":"7728010","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7728014,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Pandey","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7755810/7728014/pande-2614698-small.gif","p":["Rahul Pandey received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India, in 2010.

Heterojunction Tunnel FET (TFET) has emerged as promising transistor candidate for supply voltage scaling down to sub-0.5V due to the possibility of sub-kT/q switching without compromising on-current (ION). Recently, n-type III-V HTFET with reasonable on-current and sub-kT/q switching at supply voltage of 0.5V have been experimentally demonstrated. However, steep switching performance of III-V HTFET till date has been limited to range of drain current (IDS) spanning over less than a decade. In this work, we will present progress on complimentary Tunnel FETs and analyze primary roadblocks in the path towards achieving steep switching performance in III-V HTFET.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8919/7755810/7728014-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728014/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16486583","volume":"63","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Opportunities and Challenges of Tunnel FETs","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Opportunities and Challenges of Tunnel FETs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-datta-2614698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7755810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7755810","articleId":"7728014","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7728020,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Yoshima","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.","information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Satoshi Yoshima was received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in\n communication engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2004, 2006, and 2013 respectively.","In 2006, he joined the Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan,\n where he has been involved in research on optical access systems.

However, most content generation systems are specialized to a single game. We are interested in methods that can generate content for a wide variety of games without a game-specific algorithm design. Statistical approaches are a promising avenue for such generators and, more specifically, map generators. In this paper, we explore Markov models as a means of modeling and generating content for multiple domains. We apply our Markov models to Super Mario Bros., Loderunner , and Kid Icarus in order to determine how well our models perform in terms of the playability of the content generated, the expressive ranges of the models, and the effects of training data on those expressive ranges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728021/","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7728021/","accessionNumber":"17466648","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Generate Video Game Maps Using Markov Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Generate Video Game Maps Using Markov Models","sourcePdf":"tciaig-ontanon-2623560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106572S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"8196980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8196980","articleId":"7728021","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7728026,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Yuan Yin","affiliation":["Synergetic Innovation Center of Wireless Communication Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7728026/yin-2623663-small.gif","p":["Jia Yuan Yin was born in Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China, in 1991.

Here, a row of circularly metallic patches is placed near an ultrathin planar spoof SPP waveguide. When the SPP wave is transmitted through the waveguide, the circular patches are fed at the same time. Because of the phase difference fed to the patches, the proposed structure can realize wide-angle beam scanning from backward direction to forward direction as the frequency changes, breaking the limit of traditional leaky-wave antennas. Both numerical simulations and measured results demonstrate good performance of the proposed structure. It is shown that the scanning angle can reach 55\u00b0 with an average gain level of 9.8 dBi.

The proposed antenna contains four parts: a lower-band element, an upper-band element, arc-shaped baffle plates, and a box-shaped reflector. The lower-band element consists of two pairs of dipoles with additional branches for bandwidth enhancement. The upper-band element embraces two crossed hollow dipoles and is nested inside the lower-band element. Four arc-shaped baffle plates are symmetrically arranged on the reflector for isolating the lower- and upper-band elements and improving the radiation performance of upper-band element. As a result, the antenna can achieve a bandwidth of 50.6% for the lower band and 48.2% for the upper band when the return loss is larger than 15 dB, fully covering the frequency ranges 704-960 and 1710-2690 MHz for 2G/3G/4G applications. Measured port isolation larger than 27.5 dB in both the lower and upper bands is also obtained. At last, an array that consists of two lower-band elements and five upper-band elements is discussed for giving an insight into the future array design.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2016.2623315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7855842/07728033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2016.2623315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855842","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Broadband, Dual-Polarized Base Station Antenna for 2G/3G/4G Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Broadband, Dual-Polarized Base Station Antenna for 2G/3G/4G Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16860138","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7728033/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2014ZX03001014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Broadband, Dual-Polarized Base Station Antenna for 2G/3G/4G Applications","sourcePdf":"lawp-huang-2623315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088794S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7855842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7855842","articleId":"7728033","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7728034,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7801957/7728034/liu-2624058-small.gif","p":["Jianqing Liu received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2013.

Prior research works in CCRNs mainly focus on providing ubiquitous access and high throughput for users, but have rarely taken energy efficiency into consideration. Besides, most existing works assume that the SUs are passively selected by PUs regardless of SUs' willingness to help, which is obviously not practical. To address energy issue, this paper proposes an energy-efficient cooperative strategy by leveraging temporal and spatial diversity of the primary network. Specifically, SUs with delay-tolerant packets can proactively make the cooperative decisions by jointly considering primary channel availability, channel state information, PUs' traffic load, and their own transmission requirements. We formulate this decision-making problem based on the optimal stopping theory to maximize SUs' energy efficiency. We solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach and derive the optimal cooperative policy. Extensive simulations are then conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy. The results show significant improvements of SUs' energy efficiency compared with existing cooperative schemes, which demonstrate the benefits of our proposed cooperative strategy in conserving energy for SUs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2624058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801957","startPage":"3195","endPage":"3207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7801957/07728034.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Strategy for Secondary Users in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks for Green Communications","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/49/7801957/7728034-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728034/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Strategy for Secondary Users in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks for Green Communications","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16581243","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"12","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1409797 and CNS-1343356"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"An Energy-Efficient Strategy for Secondary Users in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks for Green Communications","sourcePdf":"jsac-liu-2624058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113037S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7801957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7801957","articleId":"7728034","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728036,"authors":[{"name":"Saedong Yeo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Saedong","lastName":"Yeo","orcid":"0000-0002-1180-232X","id":"37086013411"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0003-3524-2838","id":"37086008834"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7728036","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":981},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728036","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Complexity theory","Encoding","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","Gray codes","parity check codes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["majority-logic decoding algorithm","iterative hard-reliability improvement","NB-LDPC codes","nonbinary low-density parity-check codes","error-correcting performance","initialization process","Gray coded modulation","storage reduction method","memory size reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative hard-reliability based majority-logic decoding (IHRB-MLGD)","non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes","re-initialization","truncation"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes two methods to improve the iterative hard-reliability based majority-logic decoding algorithm for non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes.

This grouping is determined by an expert during the training step and leads to a smaller set of classes that are interpretable in a considered target task. Because the first layer relies on unsupervised learning, manual labeling of data is not required. Supervision is necessary only for the second layer and in this case is assisted by the classes provided by the first layer. The evaluation is done for two data sets acquired with different lidars and possessing different characteristics. It is done quantitatively using one of the data sets and qualitatively using another. The system design follows a standard learning procedure with training, validation, and test steps. The operation follows a standard classification pipeline. The system is simple with no requirement of preprocessing or postprocessing stages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Outdoor 3D Lidar Data Based on Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2016.2614923","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7805318/07728040.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2016.2614923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7805318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Outdoor 3D Lidar Data Based on Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728040/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618506","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Outdoor 3D Lidar Data Based on Unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Models","sourcePdf":"tase-maligo-2614923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082204S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7805318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7805318","articleId":"7728040","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728041,"authors":[{"name":"Binhuang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Binhuang","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0001-8686-9388","id":"37085469253"},{"name":"Chen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Bell Laboratories, Nokia, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38237594900"},{"name":"Bill Corcoran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Corcoran","id":"37317802700"},{"name":"Qibing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Qibing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085885264"},{"name":"Leimeng Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Leimeng","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37085391584"},{"name":"Arthur J.

access (SCMA) systems is important to enhance the system performance of future fifth generation wireless networks. However, one of the challenges in design of downlink MIMO-SCMA systems is developing near-optimum bit error rate (BER) performance detectors with affordable computational costs. To achieve this goal, we construct a joint sparse graph combining the single graph of MIMO channels and SCMA codewords, and then design the corresponding virtual SCMA codebooks for the detector. To utilize them, a novel joint processing approach based on message passing algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, two strategies for message update on the joint sparse graph, i.e., parallel and serial schedules, are, respectively, presented. Simulations show that, the proposed detector can achieve the optimal BER performance with significantly reduced complexity, compared to the maximum likelihood detector.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7857815/07728046.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Sparse Graph-Detector Design for Downlink MIMO-SCMA Systems","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2016.2623785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7857815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2016.2623785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Sparse Graph-Detector Design for Downlink MIMO-SCMA Systems","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16690208","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728046/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP Project","grantNumber":"YB2015040056"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Fund","grantNumber":"2012JQ0020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Sparse Graph-Detector Design for Downlink MIMO-SCMA Systems","sourcePdf":"lwc-du-2623785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050817S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7857815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7857815","articleId":"7728046","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728052,"authors":[{"name":"Aysha Ebrahim","affiliation":["Department of EEE, The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7818052/7728052/ebrah-2623614-small.gif","p":["Aysha Ebrahim (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Bahrain in 2009.

Pattern reconfiguration is used to encode the MIMO information onto orthogonal virtual basis patterns in the far field. A measurement campaign was conducted to compare the performance of the beam-space MIMO system with a conventional 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system under realistic propagation conditions. Propagation measurements were conducted for both systems and the mutual information and symbol error rates were estimated from Monte-Carlo simulations over the measured channel matrices. The results show the beam-space MIMO system and the conventional MIMO system exhibit similar finite-constellation capacity and error performance in nonline-of-sight scenarios when there is sufficient scattering in the channel. In comparison, in line-of-sight channels, the capacity performance is observed to depend on the relative polarization of the receiving antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2624138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7769172/07728056.pdf","startPage":"5131","endPage":"5145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2624138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing of QPSK Signals With a Single Radio: Antenna Design and Over-the-Air Experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728056/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Multiplexing of QPSK Signals With a Single Radio: Antenna Design and Over-the-Air Experiments","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16521211","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728056/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"133583"},{"fundingName":"Korean Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Multiplexing of QPSK Signals With a Single Radio: Antenna Design and Over-the-Air Experiments","sourcePdf":"tap-austin-2624138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079612S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7769172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","xplore-issue":"7769172","articleId":"7728056","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728057,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Durand","affiliation":["LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7756694/7728057/duran-2623565-small.gif","p":["Simon Durand received the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from\n the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, France, in 2012, the State Engineering degree from Supmeca\n Paris, Saint Ouen, France, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree in acoustics, signal processing, and computer science applied\n to music (ATIAM) from the Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, Paris VI), Paris, France, in 2013.

The audio signal is first segmented in frames which are synchronized at the tatum level of the music. We then extract different kind of features based on harmony, melody, rhythm, and bass content to feed convolutional neural networks that are adapted to take advantage of the characteristics of each feature. This ensemble of neural networks is combined to obtain one downbeat likelihood per tatum. The downbeat sequence is finally decoded with a flexible and efficient temporal model which takes advantage of the assumed metrical continuity of a song. We then perform an evaluation of our system on a large base of nine datasets, compare its performance to four other published algorithms and obtain a significant increase of 16.8% points compared to the second-best system, for altogether a moderate cost in test and training. The influence of each step of the method is studied to show its strengths and shortcomings.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2016.2623565","startPage":"76","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2016.2623565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7756694","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7756694/07728057.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Downbeat Tracking Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728057/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Downbeat Tracking Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Networks","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728057/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16499468","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Downbeat Tracking Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-durand-2623565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162182S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7756694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7756694","articleId":"7728057","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7728058,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangping Zhai","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7728058/zhai-2623719-small.gif","p":["Xiangping Zhai (M\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and technology from Shandong University in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong in 2013.

Such information consists of slowly varying covariance matrices in the beamforming network that can be employed to reduce instantaneous feedback overhead in transmission. Utilizing solely the statistical channel information, we study how to minimize the maximum outage probability under a weighted sum power constraint that guarantees max-min fairness to all users. This problem is, however, generally hard to solve due to the nonconvexity and nonlinear coupling between beamformer and power variables. First, assuming a fixed beamformer set, we use the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory to design a decentralized algorithm with provable geometrically fast convergence rate to compute the optimal power. Then, for the general case, we examine a certainty-equivalent margin counterpart with outage-mapped thresholds that incorporate the statistical channel information. We show that a network duality for this certainty-equivalent problem can be useful to decouple the coupling between the beamformer and power variables. This nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory motivated approach yields a feasible beamformer and power allocation that are near-optimal as compared to Monte Carlo averaging simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07728058.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2623719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Beamforming and Power Control for Optimizing the Outage Probability Fairness in MISO Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728058","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7855844/7728058-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Beamforming and Power Control for Optimizing the Outage Probability Fairness in MISO Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728058/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669141","htmlLink":"/document/7728058/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"RGC 125212 and 11212114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm Inc."},{"fundingName":"Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160229165220746"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"NS2015094"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140835"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"1401018B"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1115645"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Transmit Beamforming and Power Control for Optimizing the Outage Probability Fairness in MISO Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhai-2623719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107103S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7728058","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7728061,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Shinya\u00a0Sugiura (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201912) received the B.S.\n and M.S. degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively,\n and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and electrical engineering from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.,\n in 2010.","From 2004 to 2012, he was a Research Scientist with the Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc.,\n Nagakute, Japan.

In this paper, we propose the novel concept of an element-by-element optical MIMO system that enables the interference-free reception of parallel symbol streams; it achieves this by using an angular filter (AF) with a narrow transparent window. The AF consists of a one-dimensional photonic crystal, and the angular selectivity is obtained by using the extremely small wave vector regime. We demonstrate that the capacity of the proposed system increases linearly with the minimum number of transmit source elements and receive detectors, which is similar to conventional RF MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Element-by-Element Full-Rank Optical Wireless MIMO Systems Using Narrow-Window Angular Filter Designed Based on One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2623838","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7778274/07728061.pdf","startPage":"5601","endPage":"5609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2623838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7778274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","displayDocTitle":"Element-by-Element Full-Rank Optical Wireless MIMO Systems Using Narrow-Window Angular Filter Designed Based on One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7728061/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"16524148","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Element-by-Element Full-Rank Optical Wireless MIMO Systems Using Narrow-Window Angular Filter Designed Based on One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal","sourcePdf":"jlt-sugiura-2623838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115623S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7778274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7778274","articleId":"7728061","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728076,"authors":[{"name":"Atefeh Roostaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7728076/roost-2623676-small.gif","p":["Atefeh Roostaei received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in communication systems from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

Simulations also approve our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2623676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07728076.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2623676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"389","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff in an Interweave Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff in an Interweave Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728076/","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728076/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618461","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff in an Interweave Multiuser Cognitive Radio System","sourcePdf":"twc-derakhtian-2623676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09172S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7728076","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728080,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Guo","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7728080/guo-2623310-small.gif","p":["Jing Guo (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electronics and telecommunications engineering from The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, and the Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from The Australian National University, in 2016.

However, the coexistence of D2D and cellular users causes inter-cell and intra-cell interference. The former can be effectively managed through inter-cell interference coordination and, therefore, is not considered in this paper. Instead, we focus on the intra-cell interference and propose a D2D mode selection scheme to manage it inside a finite cellular network region. The potential D2D users are controlled by the base station (BS) to operate in D2D mode based on the average interference generated to the BS. Using stochastic geometry, we study the outage probability experienced at the BS and a D2D receiver, and spectrum reuse ratio, which quantifies the average fraction of successfully transmitting D2D users. The analysis shows that the outage probability at the D2D receiver varies for different locations. In addition, without impairing the performance at the BS, if the path-loss exponent on the cellular link is slightly lower than that on the D2D link, the spectrum reuse ratio can have negligible decrease, while the D2D users' average number of successful transmissions increases with increasing D2D node density. This indicates that an increasing level of D2D communication can be beneficial in future networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Interference","Receivers","Uplink","Wireless communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","geometry","interference (signal)","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["device-to-device communication","finite cellular network region","inter-cell interference coordination","finite cellular network region","base station","the outage probability","D2D receiver","spectrum reuse ratio","D2D link","D2D node density","D2D communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","intra-cell interference","spectrum reuse ratio","stochastic geometry","location-dependent performance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2623310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07728080.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2623310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying a Finite Cellular Network Region","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying a Finite Cellular Network Region","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728080/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7728080/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618432","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying a Finite Cellular Network Region","sourcePdf":"twc-guo-2623310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09468S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7728080","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":7728083,"authors":[{"name":"Laurens Bliek","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7728083/bliek-2615134-small.gif","p":["Laurens Bliek received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in applied mathematics from the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2011 and 2013 respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Delft Center for Systems and Control.","His current research interests include optimization, machine learning, neural networks, adaptive optics, and signal processing."]},"firstName":"Laurens","lastName":"Bliek","orcid":"0000-0002-3853-4708","id":"37086300639"},{"name":"Hans R.

The algorithm maintains a surrogate of the unknown function in the form of a random Fourier expansion. The surrogate is updated whenever a new measurement is available, and then used to determine the next measurement point. The algorithm is comparable with Bayesian optimization algorithms, but its computational complexity per iteration does not depend on the number of measurements. We derive several theoretical results that provide insight on how the hyperparameters of the algorithm should be chosen. The algorithm is compared with a Bayesian optimization algorithm for an analytic benchmark problem and three applications, namely, optical coherence tomography, optical beam-forming network tuning, and robot arm control. It is found that the DONE algorithm is significantly faster than Bayesian optimization in the discussed problems while achieving a similar or better performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2615134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8244326/07728083.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8244326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2615134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Online Optimization With Costly and Noisy Measurements Using Random Fourier Expansions","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728083/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17436335","pubMedId":"27831891","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728083/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) for Innovation in Photonic Devices","grantNumber":"IPD12020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council Advanced Grant Agreement","grantNumber":"339681"},{"fundingName":"Dutch Technology Foundation STW","grantNumber":"13336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Optimization With Costly and Noisy Measurements Using Random Fourier Expansions","sourcePdf":"tnnls-bliek-2615134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126415S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8244326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8244326","articleId":"7728083","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7728084,"authors":[{"name":"Huaqing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7728084/zhang-2623603-small.gif","p":["Huaqing Zhang (M\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2013.

Nevertheless, when multiple operators serve their user equipments (UEs) in the same unlicensed spectrum, the inter-operator interference management becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a multi-operator multi-UE Stackelberg game to analyze the interaction between multiple operators and the UEs subscribed to the services of the operators in unlicensed spectrum. In this game, to avoid intolerable interference to the Wi-Fi access point (WAP), each operator sets an interference penalty price for each UE that causes interference to the WAP, and the UEs can choose their sub-bands and determine the optimal transmit power in the chosen sub-bands of the unlicensed spectrum. Accordingly, the operators can predict the possible actions of the UEs and hence set the optimal prices to maximize its revenue earned from UEs. Furthermore, we consider two possible scenarios for the interaction of operators in the unlicensed spectrum. In the first scenario, referred to as the non-cooperative scenario, the operators cannot coordinate with each other in the unlicensed spectrum. A sub-gradient approach is applied for each operator to decide its best-response action based on the possible behaviors of others. In the second scenario, referred to as the cooperative scenario, all operators can coordinate with each other to serve UEs and control the UEs' interference in the unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results have been presented to verify the performance improvement that can be achieved by our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2623603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2623603","startPage":"348","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07728084.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game for Resource Management in LTE Unlicensed","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7809190/7728084-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game for Resource Management in LTE Unlicensed","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618429","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7728084/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CPS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CCF-1456921, CNS-1443917, ECCS-405121, NSFC61428101 and ECCS-1554576"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game for Resource Management in LTE Unlicensed","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2623603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153387S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7728084","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7728101,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Kiperwas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Kiperwas","id":"37085592016"},{"name":"Daniel Rosenfeld","affiliation":["RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rosenfeld","id":"37085594582"},{"name":"Yonina C.

This problem arises in many applications such as MRI, CT, radio astronomy and geophysics. Our algorithm, termed SParse Uniform ReSampling (SPURS), employs methods from modern sampling theory to achieve a small approximation error while maintaining low computational cost. The given non-Cartesian samples are projected onto a selected intermediate subspace, spanned by integer translations of a compactly supported kernel function. This produces a sparse system of equations describing the relation between the nonuniformly spaced samples and a vector of coefficients representing the projection of the signal onto the chosen subspace. This sparse system of equations can be solved efficiently using available sparse equation solvers. The result is then projected onto the subspace in which the sampled signal is known to reside. The second projection is implemented efficiently using a digital linear shift invariant (LSI) filter and produces uniformly spaced values of the signal on a Cartesian grid. The method can be iterated to improve the reconstruction results. We then apply SPURS to reconstruction of MRI data from nonuniformly spaced k-space samples. Simulations demonstrate that SPURS outperforms other reconstruction methods while maintaining a similar computational complexity over a range of sampling densities and trajectories as well as various input SNR levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728101/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638849","pubMedId":"27831865","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The SPURS Algorithm for Resampling an Irregularly Sampled Signal onto a Cartesian Grid","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., Israel"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The SPURS Algorithm for Resampling an Irregularly Sampled Signal onto a Cartesian Grid","sourcePdf":"tmi-kiperwas-2623711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104031S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7839249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7839249","articleId":"7728101","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7728109,"authors":[{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7728109/lv-2623652-small.gif","p":["Tiejun Lv (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201912) received the M.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China,\n in 1997 and 2000, respectively.","From January 2001 to January 2003, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

In the downlink of the TWRS, the relay is transmitting network-coded information to the sources, and each source node aims to calculate a posteriori probabilities (APPs) of the information symbols from the relay node. A sampling method based on the modified autocorrelation receiver is proposed for FG-MSDD, which has a trellis structure. The trellis can be decomposed into multiple subtrellises depending on the FG factorization. Then, a methodology for APPs is derived when the forward-and-backward message passing is performed on the subtrellises. The main advantage of FG-MSDD is that it exploits soft information accurately with the aid of the bidirectional message passing. In addition, the proposed FG-MSDD, in conjunction with any soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoding scheme, is capable of obtaining an iterative detection algorithm. Various performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulations have verified that the proposed algorithm improves detection performance for the noncoherent UWB TWRS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728109/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965007","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Factor Graph Aided Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection in the Broadcasting Phase of a Network Coding Based UWB Relay System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271188, 61401041 and 61671072"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factor Graph Aided Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection in the Broadcasting Phase of a Network Coding Based UWB Relay System","sourcePdf":"tvt-lv-2623652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065783S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7728109","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7728117,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqiang Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7779452/7728117/li-2623666-small.gif","p":["Jianqiang Li received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the South China\n University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2003 and 2008.","He is an Associated Professor with the College of Computer and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen,\n China.

Using the UAV, a ground image can be obtained from the aerial vision, which is then processed with image denoising, image correction, and obstacle recognition to construct the ground map automatically. Image correction is used to help the UGV improve the recognition accuracy of obstacles. Based on the constructed ground map, a hybrid path planning algorithm is proposed to optimize the planned path. A genetic algorithm is used for global path planning, and a local rolling optimization is used to constantly optimize the results of the genetic algorithm. Experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach can obtain a much less costly path compared to the traditional path planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and the A-star algorithm and can run in real-time to support the UAV/UGV systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2623666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7779452/07728117.pdf","endPage":"9596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Path Planning Method in Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) Cooperative Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2623666","startPage":"9585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Path Planning Method in Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) Cooperative Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728117/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16540377","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728117/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572330, 61472258 and 61602319"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014A030313554"},{"fundingName":"Technology Planning Project","grantNumber":"2014B010118005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Path Planning Method in Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) Cooperative Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2623666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068181S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7779452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7779452","articleId":"7728117","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728134,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed ElSamadouny","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7728134/elsam-2623664-small.gif","p":["Ahmed ElSamadouny received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Alexandria University, Egypt, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree in communication and information technology from Nile University, Egypt, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2016.

In addition, we propose two schemes to secure data transmission through the two-group multicasting network. The first scheme secures the network when the eavesdropper is a user in one of the two multicasting groups and, hence, its channel state information is known at the transmitter. The second scheme secures the multicasting network from external passive eavesdroppers and, hence, the channels between the transmitter and the eavesdroppers are assumed to be unknown at the transmitter. The secrecy rate is evaluated for both scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2623664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2623664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07728134.pdf","startPage":"2954","endPage":"2963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Secure Sum-Rate-Optimal MIMO Multicasting Over Medium-Voltage NB-PLC Networks","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857377","htmlLink":"/document/7728134/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"NPRP from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"6-149-2-058"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Sum-Rate-Optimal MIMO Multicasting Over Medium-Voltage NB-PLC Networks","sourcePdf":"tsg-elsamadouny-2623664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087586S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7728134","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728135,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7728135/choi-2623791-small.gif","p":["Jinho\u00a0Choi (SM\u201902) was born in Seoul, South Korea.

In MTC, devices may use low-cost hardware-based random number generators for pseudo-random noise (PN) sequences in secure communications. Since PN sequences can be estimated by correlation attacks at an eavesdropper, induced random (chip) flipping of spreading sequences is proposed to make correlation attacks infeasible. However, induced random flipping can also degrade the performance of detection and decoding at a legitimate receiver that only knows original spreading sequences. To avoid the performance degradation, we derive low-complexity iterative receiver algorithms for multiuser signal detection and decoding based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Multiple Access Based on Multicarrier CDMA With Induced Random Flipping","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2623791","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07728135.pdf","startPage":"5099","endPage":"5108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2623791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Multiple Access Based on Multicarrier CDMA With Induced Random Flipping","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7728135/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965045","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea Electric Power Corporation through Korea Electrical Engineering and Science Research Institute","grantNumber":"R15XA03-60"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Multiple Access Based on Multicarrier CDMA With Induced Random Flipping","sourcePdf":"tvt-choi-2623791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156738S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7728135","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728139,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7909058/7728139/wang-2623568-small.gif","p":["Hongliang Wang (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc.\n degree from Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, China in 2004, and received the Ph.D. degree from\n Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China in 2011.","From 2004 to 2005, he worked as an electrical engineer of Zhejiang Hengdian Thermal Power Plant.

Five-level active neutral point clamped inverter (5L-ANPC) is one of the most popular topologies among five-level inverters. A six-switch 5L-ANPC (6S-5L-ANPC) topology is proposed. Compared to the conventional 5L-ANPC inverters, the 6S-5L-ANPC reduces two active switches and has lower conduction loss. The proposed modulation enables the 6S-5L-ANPC inverter to operate under both active and reactive power conditions. The flying-capacitor capacitance is designed under both active and reactive power conditions. The analysis shows the proposed topology is suitable for photovoltaic grid-connected applications. A 1 KVA single-phase experimental prototype is built to verify the validity and flexibility of the proposed topology and modulation method.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7909058/07728139.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2623568","startPage":"6700","endPage":"6715","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2623568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A New Six-Switch Five-Level Active Neutral Point Clamped Inverter for PV Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7728139/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"16838285","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Six-Switch Five-Level Active Neutral Point Clamped Inverter for PV Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2623568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109981S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7909058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7909058","articleId":"7728139","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7728140,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Nehring","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7835239/7728140/nehri-2616873-small.gif","p":["Johannes Nehring (S\u201912) was born in Erlangen, Germany, in 1984.

Therefore, a highly integrated two-port VNA with a multioctave bandwidth from 4 to 32 GHz is presented. The proposed system is based on a fully integrated radio-frequency frontend consisting of a two-port stimulus, a four-channel heterodyne receiver, and a wideband testset. The testset is comprised of on-chip multisection directional couplers. The chip is operated inside a hardware demonstrator using a 16-term calibration procedure. The measurement of arbitrary devices under test is in excellent agreement with commercial measurement equipment and showed a mean deviation from the reference measurement of 0.17 dB and 1.29\u00b0 regarding the forward transmission of a coaxial 30-dB attenuator. The system and receiver dynamic ranges are 44-77 and 82-101 dB at a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz over the full system bandwidth. The measurements are highly repeatable and are robust against drift over time. As a proof of concept, the developed integrated network analyzers are utilized in a biomedical sensing scenario with an external and an on-chip sensor. Both approaches showed good sensitivity regarding the mixture ratio of binary solutions of ethanol and methanol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728140/","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7728140/","accessionNumber":"16637087","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Highly Integrated 4\u201332-GHz Two-Port Vector Network Analyzers for Instrumentation and Biomedical Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the research Project SeLe","grantNumber":"16SV6257"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Integrated 4\u201332-GHz Two-Port Vector Network Analyzers for Instrumentation and Biomedical Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nehring-2616873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106878S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7835239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7835239","articleId":"7728140","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":7728142,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, No. 101, Section 2, Kuang-Fu Road, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/8000754/7728142/wu-2623715-small.gif","p":["Ching-Chan Wu received the BS degree from the Department of Computer\n Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.

There are two known steps for a pair of CRs to start communication: the rendezvous and data-channel negotiation. Despite that the rendezvous can be achieved by some well-studied techniques such as the channel hopping, the strategies for data-channel negotiation receive much less attention and their impact on data transmission performance remains unclear. In this paper, we study existing data-channel negotiation schemes for channel-hopping CRs and observe that 1) for short data transmission, they incur a huge overhead, called notification delay, that severely limits the throughput; and 2) for long data transmission, they lead to large overhead, called interruption delay, in handling the PU interruption, which makes performance unstable. By carefully re-examining the steps toward low-overhead and stable data transmission, we argue that a key step, called self-channel selection, is missing and should precede the rendezvous and data channel selection steps. In this step, each CR selects, in a distributed manner, only a small amount of the most stable channels to be used in the later steps. To realize the self-channel selection, we introduce a Randomly-Started Stability-Descent (RSSD) selection algorithm. Expensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RSSD in reducing 1) the notification delay; 2) the chance of PU interruption; and 3) the interruption delay if PU interruption occurs, which overall improve the performance and quality of data transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17149438","htmlLink":"/document/7728142/","displayDocTitle":"On Low-Overhead and Stable Data Transmission between Channel-Hopping Cognitive Radios","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan and Thematic Research Grant of Academia Sinica","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-001-018 and MOST104-2221-E-001-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Low-Overhead and Stable Data Transmission between Channel-Hopping Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tmc-wu-2623715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111977S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8000754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8000754","articleId":"7728142","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728143,"authors":[{"name":"Lubing Han","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technologies and Systems and the Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7728143/han-2623716-small.gif","p":["Lubing Han received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Automation.

Specifically, the linear support vector machine classifier applies the linear combination of the order-statistics of the received signals, while the approximate maximum likelihood and the backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs) classifier resort to the reduced order-statistics to decrease the computational complexity. Moreover, BPNN is applicable for modulation classification both in known and unknown channel scenarios. It is shown that in the known channel scenario, the proposed classifiers provide a good tradeoff between performance and computational complexity, while in the unknown channel scenario, the proposed BPNN classifier outperforms the expectation maximization classifier in terms of both classification performance and computational complexity.

However, the use of NoCs in real-time systems imposes complex constraints on the overall design. This paper discusses the challenges faced, when designing NoCs for real-time applications. Contributions in this area are surveyed on the level of guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, adaptivity, and energy efficient techniques. Furthermore, the evaluation methodologies and experimental performance measurements of real-time NoCs are examined.

By means of fractional programing and changing of variables, we transform the original MINLFP problem into an equivalent optimization problem in a parametric subtractive form, which is proved to be a concave mixed-integer nonlinear programing (MINLP) problem and is optimally solved by using Dinkelbach and branch-and-bound (BB) methods. In BB method, the concave MINLP problem is relaxed to a series of concave nonlinear programing problems and solved by the use of Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar augmented Lagrangian (PHR-AL) method. The optimal solution can be used to benchmark the performance of suboptimal solutions. As the computational complexity of BB method increases exponentially with problem size, we further develop a suboptimal two-step scheme, which first allocates the resource blocks and then performs the transmit power control to give suboptimal solution with much lower complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and show that the proposed suboptimal two-step scheme is promising for practical applications as it makes a good tradeoff between EE performance and computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07728149.pdf","startPage":"5086","endPage":"5098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2624022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2624022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Downlink Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Programming","Downlink","Power demand","Linear programming","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","concave programming","energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal two-step scheme","computational complexity","PHR-AL method","Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar augmented Lagrangian method","concave nonlinear programming problem","concave MINLP problem","BB method","branch-and-bound method","Dinkelbach method","parametric subtractive form","equivalent optimization problem","MINLFP problem","nonlinear constraint","nonconcave nonlinear objective function constraint","mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming problem","EE maximization problem","orthogonal frequency division multiple access network","heterogeneous OFDMA network","energy-efficient downlink resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency (EE)","heterogeneous networks","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Downlink Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA Networks","volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7728149/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965079","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501028 and 61471089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Downlink Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2624022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142846S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7728149","onlineDate":"01 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7728150,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo A.

One way for cells to manage this noise is to attempt to minimize its effect. However, this may not always be possible, or may prove to be costly. On the other hand, the noise may be managed so that the correct decision is made most of the time. Shannon introduced rate distortion theory to evaluate the efficiency of systems like this in which error free communication may not be possible or needed. Here, we show how rate distortion theory can be used to analyze cellular decision processes.

However, such probes remain impractical for use in a clinical setting. Therefore, clinical matrix arrays rely on sub-aperture (SAP) beamforming. This makes diverging wave (DW) imaging challenging as side- and grating-lobes arise from the simultaneous reconstruction of image lines with considerably different orientations. We have previously shown in computer simulations that these difficulties could be mitigated by using a sparse transmit sequence. The present study looked at the implementation of this sequence in a clinical system. 3D TDI was acquired in vivo at 610 vol/s and compared against conventional TDI (i.e. focused transmissions). The velocity curves obtained from both methods were similar (cross correlation = 0.90 \u00b1 0.11) and the full left ventricle could be imaged at HFR in a single acquisition using the 3D DW sequence. Overall, this study supports the feasibility of HFR 3D TDI in a clinical system, despite the limitations of SAP beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728385","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728385.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728385","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frame rate 3D tissue velocity imaging using sub-aperture beamforming: A pilot study in vivo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"High frame rate 3D tissue velocity imaging using sub-aperture beamforming: A pilot study in vivo","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728385/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443787","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frame rate 3D tissue velocity imaging using sub-aperture beamforming: A pilot study in vivo","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049847S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728401,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume David","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York, NY"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"David","id":"37085746027"},{"name":"Jean-luc Robert","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, Cambdrige, MA"],"firstName":"Jean-luc","lastName":"Robert","id":"37707127900"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Medisys Philips Research France, Suresnes, France"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085749639"},{"name":"Andrew F.

However, due to mismatch between the tissue sound speed (C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tissue</sub>\n) and the beamforming sound speed (C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">beam</sub>\n), the phase coherence across the array is often compromised and the resultant image quality degrades. In order to alleviate the sound speed mismatch, differential phase gradient between sub-apertures is proposed in this study by using channel-domain autocorrelation to estimate the optimal sound speed for beamforming. Simulations of point reflector show that the differential phase gradient approaches zero whenever C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">beam</sub>\n is set to C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tissue</sub>\n. In experiments using speckle phantom, the optimized sound speed is estimated to be 1420 m/s compared to the nominal sound speed of 1450 m/s. The corresponding B-mode images at 7 MHz show that the optimization of sound speed reduces the -12-dB lateral width of point spread function from 0.94 mm to 0.71 mm. The image contrast between cyst and background also peaks near the optimized sound speed. Compared to minimum average phase variance (MAPV) method, the proposed method is more robust by reducing the coefficient of variation from 0.5 % to 0 %.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728426/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16443537","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728426/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sound speed optimization for ultrasound beamforming using differential phase gradient between sub-apertures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound speed optimization for ultrasound beamforming using differential phase gradient between sub-apertures","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048213S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728428,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A typical approach for obtaining velocity vectors consists in combining the Doppler shifts detected by receiving the echoes from two (or more) different directions. Together with plane wave transmission, this strategy can assess the velocity data over a 2D region. Real time performance is achievable, provided that the electronics is capable of beamforming and processing the data acquired from several probe apertures in between consecutive transmissions. Recently, the ULA-OP 256 research scanner was equipped with a beamformer that, exploiting a parallel/serial process strategy, grants the calculation power for beamforming and processing multiple lines. In this work we present a vector Doppler method, based on the transmission of plane waves, which detects the velocity vectors on 8 parallel lines distributed over a 2D region 1 cm wide. The method is implemented on the ULA-OP 256 scanner and it achieves, in real-time, a refresh rate higher than 20 Hz when combined in duplex with a standard B-mode. Experiments on the carotid artery of a volunteer are reported, which show the effectiveness of the real-time implementation in detecting the complex flow patterns present in the carotid.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728428","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728428.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728428","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-line measurements of blood velocity vectors in real-time","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi-line measurements of blood velocity vectors in real-time","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728428/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728428/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16429193","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-line measurements of blood velocity vectors in real-time","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088582S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728430,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The harmonic signals are extracted clearly even if the CMUTs have large nonlinearity. The beam patterns of these transmissions and extracted harmonic components are investigated using two approaches: nonlinear propagation simulation and measurement using a manufactured CMUT probe that is able to transmit sufficient pressure (over 1.5 MPa) to generate tissue harmonic components.

In the case of IMDs, transmission is characterized by low peak power and low duty cycle to reduce the potential for adverse bio-effects. Currently, most IMDs use radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves to communicate through the body. The corresponding maximum bandwidth allowed is 300 kHz as regulated by the FCC, which inherently limits the communication rates of these devices (limiting to maximum data rates of 50 kb/s). Beyond bandwidth restrictions, the main limitation for using RF electromagnetic waves in the body is loss of signal because of attenuation in the body. For these reasons the output power of RF devices is limited to 25 \u03bcW, which also limits data rates to 50 kb/s. In this study, an ultrasonic communication channel is explored for IMD communications as an alternative to EM transmission. We demonstrate the ability to communicate through tissues using the ultrasonic communications channel while maintaining data rates necessary for streaming of high definition video. In our experiments we used a matched pair of 5-MHz f/3 single-element transducers operating in a pitch-catch configuration in a tank of degassed water. Between the transducers was placed either a slab of pork tenderloin or a slab of beef liver (each more than 2 cm thick). Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signals were coded for transmission into the transmitting transducer using an arbitrary waveform generator. Signals were transmitted and captured by sending 10 snapshots (packets) of 50,000 samples (10,000 training / 40,000 decision-directed) using a fractionally-spaced (2 samples per symbol) decision feedback equalizer with up to 40 taps in the feed forward section, and 40 taps in the feedback section. Signals were successfully decoded through the samples using QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM codes with bit error rates of (BER) <; 1e-4. A maximum data rate of 30 Mbps using the 64QAM was achieved through both the pork tenderloin and the beef livers. These experiments successfully demonstrate that communications through the ultrasonic channel can provide data rates capable of streaming high definition video.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728490.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE

using Hidden Markov Model with wavelet features","abstract":"In this work, modeling of a stochastic non stationary process is used to detect flaw echoes in ultrasonic NDE signals. This research aims at locating the flaw (if any) present in the NDE signal using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMM works on the principle that any non-stationary stochastic signals are generated by a hidden process which can be approximated by a Markov Model. The states present in the Hidden Markov Model are unknown and may vary according to the application. For ultrasonic flaw detection application, three states were assumed to model low level noise, high level noise and the flaw. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was chosen as feature input to HMM. Experimental results show that flaws can be detected even in signals with very low signal to noise ratio. Compared to other regression methods such as Support Vector Regression, HMM performs better and requires less effort and A-scan data for training.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728491/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16429192","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728491/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic flaw detection using Hidden Markov Model with wavelet features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic flaw detection using Hidden Markov Model with wavelet features","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036238S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7728502,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Medisys, Philips Research France, France"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085749639"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Robert","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, USA"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Robert","id":"37707127900"},{"name":"Guillaume David","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"David","id":"37085746027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728502","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Image reconstruction","Acoustic measurements","Phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","compressed sensing","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-corrective compressed-beamforming","ultrasound imaging","compressed sensing","phase perturbations","acoustic measurements","phase regularization","aberrations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Phase correction","Phase screening","Iterative beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728502","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728502","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"Compressed-sensing (CS) based beamformers have drawn increasing interest in ultrasound community for their potential of providing better image quality with fewer data.

Recently, we reported a high range resolution technique that applies minimum variance beamformer to the frequency components of the RF signal after a delay-and-sum process. The technique has high performance in the improvement of the range resolution when a target has flat interfaces, such as a longitudinal section of an artery. In the present study, we report further advance of this technique to enhance image quality of a normal swine eye whose anatomy is marked by multiple layers of curved interfaces. The reference signal is acquired by the coherent integration of the echoes from isolated interfaces to take account of the attenuation and the interface shape. The proposed technique succeeded to offer a sharp rendering of the cornea boundaries of the swine eye, where the center frequency of the transmit ultrasound pulse was 12 MHz. Computationally, it required 5 seconds using a laptop PC with a single CPU for the depiction of an image in the ROI that consists of 422,528 pixels. We reckon that, if the proposed technique is implemented using GPUs, high-quality images of the eye (with both lateral and range resolution enhancements) can be readily achieved in real time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728530.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum variance beamformer applied to frequency components of the RF signal of the eye: Enhancing the image quality of curved interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728530/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum variance beamformer applied to frequency components of the RF signal of the eye: Enhancing the image quality of curved interfaces","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443643","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum variance beamformer applied to frequency components of the RF signal of the eye: Enhancing the image quality of curved interfaces","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061134S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728573,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Chau","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Laboratorio de Im\u00e1genes M\u00e9dicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Chau","id":"37085880134"},{"name":"Marko Jakovljevic","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Jakovljevic"},{"name":"Roberto Lavarello","affiliation":["Laboratorio de Im\u00e1genes M\u00e9dicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Lavarello","id":"37399532300"},{"name":"Jeremy Dahl","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA, US"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Dahl"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728573","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Robustness","Image resolution","Picture archiving and communication systems","Covariance matrices","Measurement","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust minimum variance beamformer","locally adaptive phase aberration correction","delay-and-sum beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728573","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728573","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"Although the minimum variance (MV) beamformer can provide enhancement in both resolution and contrast of ultrasound images when compared with conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, its clinical application is limited by its sensitivity to phase aberrations. Several robust MV beamformers have been proposed, but present limitations when faced with second order phase aberration. Additionally, the information that can be obtained from phase aberration correction (PAC) methods is not utilized and the gain in robustness is usually accompanied by a loss in resolution or contrast. In the current work, we propose a new robust MV beamformer that uses a locally adaptive PAC (LAPAC-MV) in order to cope with the aformentioned difficulties. The method is based on a PAC estimation at every point in the image domain and a profile decision logic is included in the algorithm to take into account regions with low signal power. Preliminary results in full wave simulations and experimental phantom data are reported. In the resulting images, LAPAC-MV achieved enhancement in resolution of 0.03 mm, and reduction in sidelobe levels of around 8 dB when compared with precorrected DAS (DAS-PC) or precorrected MV (MV-PC). Contrast of LAPAC-MV is equivalent to MV-PC in cyst target simulations but the former showed improvements of approximately 1 dB in contrast in experiments with a 20 mm thick tissue aberrator.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728573.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust minimum variance beamformer using locally adaptive phase aberration correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728573/","displayDocTitle":"Robust minimum variance beamformer using locally adaptive phase aberration correction","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443644","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust minimum variance beamformer using locally adaptive phase aberration correction","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059358S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728574,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Most previous research has focused on suppressing off-axis artifacts but is generally limited by factors such as high computation requirements, limited improvements, or ultrasound hardware modifications. This paper describes a new tensor based directional noise suppression method to suppress the off-axis energy. The pre-beamformed channel data are first delay compensated so signals of interest are aligned horizontally while off-axis distractions are aligned in different angles. Then we perform tensor analysis on the aligned channel data to identify regions with strong gradients vertically. Directional high pass filtering is then applied based on tensor analysed results so both weak horizontal lines and strong off-axis non-horizontal structures are suppressed. In a point phantom study, the contrast ratio (CR) is improved from 0.71 to 0.85. In a bone phantom study, the CR is improved from 0.60 to 0.87.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443872","htmlLink":"/document/7728581/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Tensor-based off-axis noise suppression in pre-beamformed data to enhance the visualization of hyper echoic structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tensor-based off-axis noise suppression in pre-beamformed data to enhance the visualization of hyper echoic structures","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072556S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728593,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Ramalli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Ramalli","id":"37705628900"},{"name":"Alessandro Dallai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Dallai","id":"37298256300"},{"name":"Enrico Boni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Boni","id":"37297968800"},{"name":"Luca Bassi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bassi","id":"37300906200"},{"name":"Valentino Meacci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentino","lastName":"Meacci","id":"37085575691"},{"name":"Matteo Giovannetti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Giovannetti","id":"37085895258"},{"name":"Ling Tong","affiliation":["Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tong","id":"37071662500"},{"name":"Jan D'hooge","affiliation":["Dept. of Cardiovascular Sciences, Lab. on Cardiovascular Imaging & Dynamics, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"D'hooge","id":"37277201000"},{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Tortoli","id":"37085384053"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Real-time systems","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Probes","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical ultrasonics","cardiology","deformation","medical image processing","muscle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitransmit beams","fast cardiac imaging","clinical routine","multiple-line transmit techniques","MLT","multiple focused beams","image resolution","image contrast","regional myocardial deformation","left ventricular dyssynchrony","pulse-width modulator","ULA-OP 256 research scanner","128-element phased array probe","real-time imaging","image quality","ultrasound advanced open platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi line transmit","Real-time","Cardiac imaging","High frame rate imaging"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi transmit beams for fast cardiac imaging towards clinical routine","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728593","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728593","abstract":"Multiple-line transmit (MLT) techniques, involving the simultaneous transmission of multiple focused beams into different directions, increase the frame rate without significantly compromising the resolution or contrast.

Experiments with the ULA-OP 256 research scanner connected to a 128-element phased array probe show that real-time imaging is feasible at up to 212 Hz without significant reduction in image quality or field-of-view, pushing fast MLT cardiac imaging one-step forward to clinical routine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443747","htmlLink":"/document/7728593/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multi transmit beams for fast cardiac imaging towards clinical routine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi transmit beams for fast cardiac imaging towards clinical routine","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134475S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728594,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Boni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Boni","id":"37297968800"},{"name":"Luca Bassi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bassi","id":"37300906200"},{"name":"Alessandro Dallai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Dallai","id":"37298256300"},{"name":"Valentino Meacci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentino","lastName":"Meacci","id":"37085575691"},{"name":"Alessandro Ramalli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Ramalli","id":"37705628900"},{"name":"Monica Scaringella","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Scaringella","id":"37296095500"},{"name":"Francesco Guidi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Guidi","id":"37298011700"},{"name":"Stefano Ricci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Ricci","id":"37287556500"},{"name":"Piero Tortoli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Tortoli","id":"37085384053"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728594","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Real-time systems","Ultrasonic imaging","Digital signal processing","Array signal processing","Image reconstruction","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","field programmable gate arrays","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time beamformer","high frame rate ultrasound imaging","defocused wave transmission","plane wave transmission","focused beams","FPGA","parallel beamformer","256-channel ultrasound advanced open platform","ULA-OP","HFR B-Mode images","real-time processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Research scanner","Open platform","Programmable ultrasound system","High-frame-rate imaging"]}],"abstract":"High frame rate (HFR) imaging methods based on the transmission of defocused or plane-waves rather than focused beams are increasingly popular.

However, for automatically finding the flow angle a computationally expensive approach is used. This work presents a method for estimating the flow angle using a combination of inexpensive transverse oscillation (TO) estimators and only 3 directional beamformed lines. The suggested DB vector flow estimator is employed with steered plane wave transmissions for high frame rate imaging. Two distinct plane wave sequences are used: a short sequence (3 angles) for fast flow and an interleaved long sequence (21 angles) for both slow flow and B-mode. Parabolic flow with a peak velocity of 0.5 m/s is measured at beam-to-flow angles of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The DB method estimates the angle with a bias and standard deviation (STD) less than 2\u00b0, and the STD of the velocity magnitude is 2.5 %. This is 7 - 8.5 % when using TO. The long sequence has a higher sensitivity, and when used for estimation of slow flow with a peak velocity of 0.04 m/s, the SD is 2.5 % and bias is 0.1 %. This is a factor of 4 better than if the short sequence is used. The carotid bifurcation was scanned on a healthy volunteer, and the short sequence was used with TO and DB to estimate velocity vectors. The STD of the velocity profile over a cardiac cycle was 6.1 % for TO and 4.9 % for DB.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728662","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728662.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728662","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In vivo high frame rate vector flow imaging using plane waves and directional beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"In vivo high frame rate vector flow imaging using plane waves and directional beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728662/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443682","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In vivo high frame rate vector flow imaging using plane waves and directional beamforming","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103784S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7728665,"authors":[{"name":"Arooba Zeshan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Arooba","lastName":"Zeshan","id":"37085892680"},{"name":"Xiao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Xiao Zhang","id":"37085368544"},{"name":"\u00d6mer Oralkan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"\u00d6mer","lastName":"Oralkan","id":"37283941000"},{"name":"F.

FDMAS gained its popularity due to its capability to produce results faster than any other adaptive beamforming technique such as minimum variance (MV) which requires higher computational complexity. The average computational time for single point spread function (PSF) at 40 mm depth for FDMAS is 87 times faster than MV. The new beamforming technique has been tested on PSF and cyst phantoms experimentally with the ultrasound array research platform version 2 (UARP II) using a 3-8 MHz 128 element clinical transducer. FDMAS is able to improve both imaging contrast and spatial resolution as compared to DAS. The wire phantom main lobes lateral resolution improved in FDMAS by 40.4% with square pulse excitation signal when compared to DAS. Meanwhile the contrast ratio (CR) obtained for an anechoic cyst located at 15 mm depth for PWI with DAS and FDMAS are -6.2 dB and -14.9 dB respectively. The ability to reduce noise from off axis with auto-correlation operation in FDMAS pave the way to display the B-mode image with high dynamic range. However, the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) measured at same cyst location for FDMAS give less reading compared to DAS. Nevertheless, this drawback can be compensated by applying compound plane wave imaging (CPWI) technique on FDMAS. In overall the new FDMAS beamforming technique outperforms DAS in laboratory experiments by narrowing its main lobes and increases the image contrast without sacrificing its frame rates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728678.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of contrast and resolution of B-mode plane wave imaging (PWI) with non-linear filtered delay multiply and sum (FDMAS) beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7728678/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of contrast and resolution of B-mode plane wave imaging (PWI) with non-linear filtered delay multiply and sum (FDMAS) beamforming","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443871","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of contrast and resolution of B-mode plane wave imaging (PWI) with non-linear filtered delay multiply and sum (FDMAS) beamforming","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051285S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728682,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulrhman Alshaya","affiliation":["Ultrasound Group, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Abdulrhman","lastName":"Alshaya","id":"37085904974"},{"name":"Sevan Harput","affiliation":["Ultrasound Group, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Sevan","lastName":"Harput","id":"37399486300"},{"name":"Asraf M.

Delay and sum (DAS) beamforming is the traditional method to reconstruct photoacoustic images. However, for structures located deep in the tissue (>10 mm), signal to noise (SNR) of the photoacoustic signal drops significantly. This study proposes using filter delay multiply and sum (FDMAS) beamforming technique to increase the SNR and enhance the image quality.

Using ultrasound transducers with lots of elements requires high channel count electronics. Applications for such systems range from functional ultrafast imaging using high element count linear array transducers for imaging of a large field of view to real time volumetric imaging with matrix array transducers. To perform volumetric transmit beamforming with matrix transducers, lots of these matrix elements have to be controlled individually. Furthermore, many elements need to be excited in order to compensate for the small active element size and provide a sufficient overall active footprint to generate enough acoustic power for imaging with adequate SNR. The system is set up based on our platform concept with the common ultrasound research device components: mainboard, power supply, application-specific new front ends integrating 16 channels on each PCB and device software. Using 16 front ends results in a total channel count of 256. The new front ends are based on our existing 8 channel front end technology and share the same concepts with doubled channel count for both transmission and reception. The system generates transmit sequences with voltages up to 150 Vpp and digitizes with a sampling rate of up to 80 MHz. The beamformer implements the control for additional external multiplexers in the transducer probe. This has been tested with an external transducer matrix array and can be used to connect to our custom 1024 elements matrix array (32\u00d732 elements) with a 1:4 multiplexer integrated into the probe head. Received data can be accessed as single element channel data of all 256 channels in parallel and transferred to a PC via PCI-Express. Beamforming can be done on a massively parallel computing graphics processor (GPU). The used software includes standard applications for measurements and interfaces for Matlab, C++ and C#. It is used to process, analyze and visualize data from the beamformer. This system will be scalable to an even higher channel count by connecting several beamformers to a single PC using multiple PCI-Express connections and additional synchronization over all single beamformer electronics. It is the basis of our 3D/4D ultrasound research system connected to our matrix arrays developed in-house.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728714/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16443784","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728714/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High channel count ultrasound beamformer system with external multiplexer support for ultrafast 3D/4D ultrasound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High channel count ultrasound beamformer system with external multiplexer support for ultrafast 3D/4D ultrasound","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051111S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728717,"authors":[{"name":"Ole Marius Hoel Rindal","affiliation":["Universitetet i Oslo, Oslo, NO"],"firstName":"Ole Marius Hoel","lastName":"Rindal"},{"name":"Andreas Austeng","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Austeng","id":"37300458900"},{"name":"Hans Torp","affiliation":["Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Torp","id":"37085353053"},{"name":"Sverre Holm","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Sverre","lastName":"Holm","id":"37085541363"},{"name":"Alfonso Rodriguez-Molares","affiliation":["Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Rodriguez-Molares","id":"37085608604"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728717","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Dynamic range","Array signal processing","Coherence","Image resolution","Wires","Phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic range","adaptive beamformers","wire targets","uniform cysts","phantom","calibration","Mallart-Fink coherence factor","Camacho-Fritsch phase coherence factor","Capon minimum variance beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive beamforming","Dynamic range","Coherence Factor","Phase Coherence Factor","Capon Minimum Variance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728717","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728717","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","abstract":"All adaptive beamformers aim at increased resolution and better contrast.

The simulation results showed that the side-lobe and grating-lobe levels were improved by 11.73 dB and 19.12 dB, respectively, while the peak signal-to-noise ratios improved by 6-9 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728731","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728731.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728731","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving micro-beamforming by error compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improving micro-beamforming by error compensation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728731/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443581","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving micro-beamforming by error compensation","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-000994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072997S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728735,"authors":[{"name":"Fanglue Lin","affiliation":["Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Fanglue","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085884979"},{"name":"Juan D.

A double-oscillating field is synthesized using two sets of focused emissions separated by a distance in the lateral direction. A low-resolution line (LRL) is created for each emission in the first stage beamformer, and a second beamformer provides the high-resolution data used for the velocity estimation. The method makes it possible to have continuously available data in the whole image. Therefore, high and low velocities can be estimated with a high frame rate and a low standard deviation. The first stage is a fixed-focus beamformer that can be integrated in the transducer handle, enabling the wireless transmission of the LRLs. The approach does not require any angle compensation or prior knowledge on the beam-to-flow angle. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated through simulations and flow rig measurements of a parabolic flow in a vessel at 90-degree beam-to-flow angle. The mean bias obtained from 50 independent measurements is equal to -0.67% for the lateral profile and -0.43% for the axial profile. The relative standard deviation is 3.19% and 0.47% for the lateral and axial profiles. It is, therefore, demonstrated that vector velocity estimation can be efficiently integrated in a portable ultrasound scanner with state-of-the-art performance.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728777","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728777.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728777","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector velocity estimation for portable ultrasound using directional transverse oscillation and synthetic aperture sequential beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Vector velocity estimation for portable ultrasound using directional transverse oscillation and synthetic aperture sequential beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728777/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443861","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector velocity estimation for portable ultrasound using directional transverse oscillation and synthetic aperture sequential beamforming","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069418S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728786,"authors":[{"name":"Seyedfakhreddin Nabavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Newfoundland, St. Jon's, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Seyedfakhreddin","lastName":"Nabavi","id":"37085907152"},{"name":"Lihong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Newfoundland, St. Jon's, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280170400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728786","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Analytical models","Mathematical model","Piezoelectric materials","Micromechanical devices","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","micromechanical devices","piezoelectric transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conversion efficiency","design automation technique","finite element method","genetic algorithm","MEMS piezoelectric energy harvester design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MEMS Energy Harvester","Genetic Algorithm","Optimization","Piezoelectric"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728786","abstract":"MEMS piezoelectric energy harvesters, due to their unique features in power density and ease of fabrication, are known as one of the most promising solutions for providing unlimited power sources for low-power electronic applications.

In recent years, super resolution imaging techniques have overcome the diffraction limit through the localization and tracking of a sparse set of microbubbles through the vasculature. However, this has only been performed on fixated tissue, limiting its clinical application. This paper proposes a technique for making super resolution images on non-fixated tissue by first compensating for tissue movement and then tracking the individual microbubbles. The experiment is performed on the kidney of a anesthetized Sprage-Dawley rat by infusing SonoVue at 0.1\u00d7 original concentration. The algorithm demonstrated in vivo that the motion compensation was capable of removing the movement caused by the mechanical ventilator. The results shows that microbubbles were localized with a higher precision, reducing the standard deviation of the super localizations from 22\u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm. The paper proves that the restriction of completely fixated tissue can be eliminated, when making super resolution imaging with microbubbles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443623","htmlLink":"/document/7728793/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust microbubble tracking for super resolution imaging in ultrasound","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust microbubble tracking for super resolution imaging in ultrasound","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065473S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728795,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Jiang","affiliation":["University College Cork, School of Engineering - Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085459305"},{"name":"William M.

Airborne ultrasound may be used as an alternative to RF for indoor wireless communication systems for securely transmitting data over short ranges, as signals are difficult to intercept from outside the room. A pair of off-the-shelf air-coupled capacitive ultrasonic transducers with a centre frequency of 50 kHz was used in the implementation of an indoor airborne wireless ultrasonic communication system. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation methods were successfully implemented using multiple orthogonal subchannels. The maximum system data rate of up to 180 kb/s was achieved using 16-QAM modulation with ultrasonic channels from 55 kHz to 99 kHz, over an error-free line-of-sight transmission distance of 6 m. The spectral efficiency achieved was 4 b/s/Hz. The transmission range with no measurable errors could be extended to 9 m and 11 m using QPSK and BPSK modulation schemes, respectively. The achieved data rates for the QPSK and BPSK schemes were 90 kb/s and 45 kb/s using the same bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728795","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor wireless communication using airborne ultrasound and OFDM methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728795/","displayDocTitle":"Indoor wireless communication using airborne ultrasound and OFDM methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443615","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728795/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor wireless communication using airborne ultrasound and OFDM methods","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067477S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728799,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We built an experimental setup with which we measured the ultrasonic transmittance. By using XYZ scanner, focused transducers and a hydrophone, we obtained ultrasonic transmission images of ex-vivo rat skulls. We found these images to be consistent with the anatomical structure. We also measured the transmittance frequency response of the rat skulls. We observed interference patterns in frequency responses which is consistent with the acoustical cavity model we proposed.

The system is tested using a semi-kerfed 64 element 45 MHz phased array with 1\u03bb element pitch. The grating lobe suppression is facilitated with the sign coherence factor (SCF) and split-aperture transmit beamforming techniques. A new split-aperture transmit technique called \u201csub-aperture probing\u201d (SAP) is described, experimentally validated, and compared to previously developed split-aperture techniques with respect to grating lobe suppression. Grating lobe levels were suppressed to be 49 and 60 dB below the main lobe when using 2 split-apertures with a SCF weighting factor of 1 and 2. These levels were further suppressed to 51 and 66 dB below the main lobe when splitting the aperture into 4 evenly sized apertures. When using SAP with 16 elements for the sub-aperture, grating lobes were suppressed to 49 and 64 dB below the main lobe. SAP with 8 elements yielded improved results compared to SAP with 16 elements; suppressing grating lobe levels to 49 and 65 dB below the main lobe for the associated SCF weighting coefficients. Finally the grating lobe suppression performance was tested on a wire target embedded in a tissue phantom and the signal to tissue speckle levels were characterized.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728823","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728823.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728823","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time, 45 MHz, split-aperture phased array beamformer with efficient sign coherence grating lobe suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real-time, 45 MHz, split-aperture phased array beamformer with efficient sign coherence grating lobe suppression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728823/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7728823/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16443575","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time, 45 MHz, split-aperture phased array beamformer with efficient sign coherence grating lobe suppression","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113228S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728845,"authors":[{"name":"Brecht Heyde","affiliation":["Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium"],"firstName":"Brecht","lastName":"Heyde","id":"38364912200"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Dei","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Dei","id":"37085895897"},{"name":"Brett Byram","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Byram","id":"37396852900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728845","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Strain","Apertures","Image quality","Image sequences","Phased arrays","Myocardium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echocardiography","image sequences","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear beamforming","cluttered cardiac ultrasound","curvilinear array","image quality","model-based beamforming technique","dynamic sequences","diffuse cluttered echocardiography sequences","discrete cluttered echocardiography sequences","strain error","B-Mode contrast","contrast-to-noise ratio","standard deviation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-linear beamforming with ADMIRE to facilitate deformation imaging in cluttered cardiac ultrasound","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728845","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728845","abstract":"We have previously shown for static abdominal images acquired with a curvilinear array, that image quality can be improved with a model-based beamforming technique, termed ADMIRE. Our goal in this study is to demonstrate that ADMIRE can be extended to small phased arrays apertures, and can improve reliability of GLS in dynamic sequences subject to clutter. In particular, we applied ADMIRE on simulations of `discrete' and `diffuse' cluttered echocardiography sequences. Finally, tracking performance and GLS was estimated using non-rigid image registration. ADMIRE improved B-Mode contrast by 23 and 16 dB in the discrete and diffuse clutter cases, respectively. In both cases contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was improved by 1.1 dB. The mean and standard deviation of the incremental displacement errors are all reduced after ADMIRE relative to the clutter cases-typically by a factor of two. The baseline GLS error was 1.24\u00b11.51% compared to the diffuse clutter case of 3.00\u00b13.21% and 1.55\u00b11.87% after ADMIRE, and for the discrete clutter case errors were 1.94\u00b12.40% and 1.42\u00b11.62% after ADMIRE. These results demonstrate that clutter makes assessing GLS more difficult as both displacement and strain error increased.

In MMUS, an oscillating external magnetic field displaces tissue loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles, whereas in SDUV, periodic tissue motion is induced using acoustic radiation force (ARF) to measure visco-elastic properties. BSS motion detection performance in MMUS imaging and SDUV was compared against frequency-phase locked (FPL) and normalized cross-correlation (NCC) motion detectors, respectively, in silico and in experimental phantoms. Parametric MMUS phantom images constructed using the BSS method had nearly twice the SNR of the corresponding images constructed using FPL method when a 0.043 mm or smaller kernel size was used. In FEM models of SDUV, the error in the BSS-estimated viscoelastic properties of simulated materials was <; 10%, whereas the error was > 20% using NCC when the simulated SNR was 15 dB. In a calibrated elasticity phantom, the amplitude of the motion was \u2264 0.5 \u03bcm for a scanner power level \u2264 20%.

Row-based beamforming methods formulate the forward problem for each image row and accordingly solve an inverse problem separately at each image depth. In this work, we propose a full-frame inverse-problem based beamforming method, where we define the forward problem for the entire image and solve an inverse problem for all image depths jointly.

Our method, which is based on the theory provided in [1]-[8], formulates the ultrafast pulse-echo imaging process as a linear inverse scattering problem (ISP). The ISP is derived from a realistic physical model for the propagation, absorption, and scattering of ultrasonic waves in biological soft tissues. The ISP recovers fluctuations in the tissues' compressibility from observations of the scattered sound field. For the sequential emission of only a few steered plane waves (PWs), the ill-posed and underdetermined ISP is regularized based on CS. We postulate the existence of a sparse representation of the fluctuations to be recovered under a known linear transform, e.g. the Canonical basis or wavelets. Our method is implemented efficiently in the temporal frequency domain using a version of the fast multipole method parallelized on a graphics processing unit. Emitting only a single steered PW, the mean {axial; lateral} widths were {90 \u03bcm; 110 \u03bcm} for the simulation data and {330 \u03bcm; 370 \u03bcm} for the experimental data, corresponding to improvements up to 85%compared to the reference delay-and-sum algorithm provided by the organizers.

Our beamforming proposal consists in a weighted minimum variance approach which combines a phase coherence factor calculation and a minimum variance beamforming. The computation is made in the IQ domain in order to reduce the calculation effort. An adaptive scheme is used to optimize the number of elements that are considered for the MV beamforming, which depends on the depth and the lateral position of the reconstructed pixel. Moreover, the coherence maps are filtered in order to avoid strong discontinuities and speckle penalty on the platform. The obtained results on the MIDAS platform demonstrates higher CNR and resolution compare to classical DAS approach. The main limitation of our weighted MV lies on the final axial resolution which is not improved and limits the overall performance of the method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16443884","htmlLink":"/document/7728903/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive minimum variance coupled with sign and phase coherence factors in IQ domain for plane wave beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive minimum variance coupled with sign and phase coherence factors in IQ domain for plane wave beamforming","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051763S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7728904,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Bai","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Chen Bai","id":"37085679776"},{"name":"Meiling Ji","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Meiling Ji","id":"37085891789"},{"name":"Mingxi Wan","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Mingxi Wan","id":"37288448800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728904","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Imaging","Image resolution","Ultrasonic imaging","Clutter","Acoustics","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","phantoms","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast adaptive beamforming","multiple apodization","ultrasound plane wave imaging","adaptive beamforming method","medical ultrasound imaging","image quality","imaging resolution","delay-and-sum beamformer","eigenspace-based minimum variance beamformer","image contrast","principal component analysis","Multiapodization with Cross-correlation","beamforming technique","null subtraction imaging","sidelobes suppression","contrast improvement","resolution improvement","computation complexity reduction","radiofrequency data-point target","cyst phantoms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["eigenspace-based MV","Null subtraction imaging","principal component analysis","Multi-Apodization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast adaptive beamforming combined with multiple apodization in ultrasound plane wave imaging","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728373","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7589760/7728373/07728904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728904","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7728904","abstract":"Adaptive beamforming methods, most based on the minimum variance(MV), are widely used in medical ultrasound imaging because of their significant improvement in image quality, especially the imaging resolution, compared with conventional delay-and-sum(DAS) beamformer. Recently, a new eigenspace-based MV(EIBMV) beamformer has been proposed to enhance the image contrast which is not satisfactory in MV beamforming, by utilizing the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix. principal component analysis was introduced to solve the problem of computational complexity existing in MV-based beamformers. Besides, Multi-Apodization with Cross-correlation(MAX) is also a novel beamforming technique, utilizing multiple pairs of complementary receive apodizaions for clutter and sidelobes suppression whereas maintaining the lateral resolution. By contrast, Null Subtraction Imaging(NSI) uses different on-receive apodizations on copies of the same image, contributing more in improving lateral resolution than that in reducing sidelobe levels. Thus in this work, combining the PCI, EIBMV, MAX and NSI together, we proposed a fast adaptive beamforming to realize clutter and sidelobes suppression, contrast and resolution improvement, computation complexity reduction simultaneously. And we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by using simulated and experimental RF data-point targets as well as cyst phantoms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7728904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16429171","htmlLink":"/document/7728904/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast adaptive beamforming combined with multiple apodization in ultrasound plane wave imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast adaptive beamforming combined with multiple apodization in ultrasound plane wave imaging","confLoc":"Tours, France","sourcePdf":"IUS2016-001545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045183S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7589760","isNumber":"7728373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7589760","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7728373","articleId":"7728904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7728907,"authors":[{"name":"Teodora Szasz","affiliation":["IRIT, UMR CNRS, Universit Paul Sabatier, France"],"firstName":"Teodora","lastName":"Szasz","id":"37085581441"},{"name":"Adrian Basarab","affiliation":["IRIT, UMR CNRS, Universit Paul Sabatier, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Basarab","id":"37298011900"},{"name":"Denis Kouam\u00e9","affiliation":["Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees, Toulouse, Occitanie, FR"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Kouam\u00e9"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9897-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9898-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"}],"articleNumber":"7728907","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Image quality","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Inverse problems","Laplace equations","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","image resolution","inverse problems","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u21131-norm regularized beamforming","ultrasound imaging","plane wave imaging","medical ultrasound","IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium 2016","inverse problem","Laplacian","basis pursuit","ultrasound image quality","steered plane waves","spatial resolution","image contrast"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound imaging","beamforming","inverse problems","beamspace processing","Laplacian priors","Basis Pursuit"]}],"abstract":"This paper is part of the challenge on plane wave imaging in medical ultrasound , organized during the IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium 2016 in Tours (France).

In this paper, we propose the use of artificial intelligence to understand the wind flow pattern and thereby the wake induced power losses within an existing wind farm. The farm considered for this study has 64 wind turbines of 2 MW rated capacity. Three learning methods based on artificial intelligence are used for the study.

A flexible means of separating ships from sea is ideal and can be accomplished using machine learning. Newer, advanced deep learning techniques offer a unique solution but traditionally require a large dataset to train effectively. Highway Networks allow for very deep networks that can be trained using the smaller datasets typical in SAR-based ship detection. A flexible network configuration is possible within Highway Networks due to an adaptive gating mechanism which prevents gradient decay across many layers. This paper presents a very deep High Network configuration as a ship discrimination stage for SAR ship detection. It also presents a three-class SAR dataset that allows for more meaningful analysis of ship discrimination performances. The proposed method was tested on a this SAR dataset and had the highest mean accuracy of all methods tested at 96.67%.

Contrarily to the conventional dimensionality reduction schemes, the spectral compressive acquisition method (SpeCA) performs dimensionality reduction based on random projections. The SpeCA methodology has applications in Hyperspectral Compressive Sensing and also in dimensionality reduction. Due to the extremely large volumes of data collected by imaging spectrometers, high performance computing architectures are needed for data compression of high dimensional hyperspectral data under real-time constrained applications. In this paper a parallel implementation of SpeCA on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) is proposed. The proposed implementation is performed in a pixel-by-pixel fashion using coalesced accesses to memory and exploiting shared memory to store temporary data. Furthermore, the kernels have been optimized to minimize the threads divergence, therefore, achieving high GPU occupancy. The experimental results obtained for simulated and real hyperspectral data sets reveal speedups up to 21 times, which demonstrates that the GPU implementation can significantly accelerate the methods execution over big datasets while maintaining the methods accuracy.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729064.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"283","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image reconstruction from random projections on GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image reconstruction from random projections on GPU","htmlLink":"/document/7729064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16445816","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image reconstruction from random projections on GPU","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0000280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048382S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7729072,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Hellbourg","affiliation":["CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Hellbourg","id":"38490247600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729072","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729072","abstract":"The increasing spectrum occupancy is a serious threat for highly sensitive astronomical measurement at radio frequencies.

Inspired by the astounding achievement of CNNs in object recognition and detection, we develop a novel method to detect buildings in cluttered images which consists of three main steps. Firstly, a multi-scale saliency computation is employed to extract built-up areas and a sliding windows approach is applied to generate candidate regions. Then, a CNN is applied to classify the regions. Finally, an improved non maximum suppression is used to remove false buildings. We test our method on a collection of very challenging Google Earth images and achieve 89% precision, which shows robustness and efficiency of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445666","htmlLink":"/document/7729166/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN based suburban building detection using monocular high resolution Google Earth images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN based suburban building detection using monocular high resolution Google Earth images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0000661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052136S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729171,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085893376"},{"name":"Xinyu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085893515"},{"name":"Yanfei Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37401258700"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729171","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"The leaked heat pipeline can be detected as temperature anomalies from the air-borne thermal image.

While significant efforts have been made in developing various methods for scene classification, most of them are based on handcrafted or shallow learning-based features. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for scene classification. To this end, we first adopt two simple and effective strategies to extract CNN features: (1) using pre-trained CNN models as universal feature extractors, and (2) domain-specifically fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models on our scene classification dataset. Then, scene classification is carried out by using simple classifiers such as linear support vector machine (SVM). In our work, three off-the-shelf CNN models including AlexNet [1], VGGNet [2], and GoogleNet [3] are investigated. Comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available 21 classes land use dataset and comparisons with several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that deep CNN features are effective for scene classification of high resolution remote sensing images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445774","htmlLink":"/document/7729193/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scene classification of high resolution remote sensing images using convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene classification of high resolution remote sensing images using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0000767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077579S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7729230,"authors":[{"name":"Jingge Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, USTC, Hefei, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Hefei"],"firstName":"Jingge","lastName":"Li","id":"37085898638"},{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, USTC, Hefei, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Hefei"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37418112900"},{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, USTC, Hefei, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Hefei"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37085898502"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729230","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":691},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Synthetic aperture radar","Buildings","Neural networks","Data mining","Robustness","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","neural nets","object detection","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale convolutional neural network","built-up areas detection","high resolution SAR images","multiscale CNN model","image patches","features extraction","TerraSAR-X high resolution images","Beijing","China"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high-resolution SAR images","built-up areas","multiscale Convolutional neural networks"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the problem of built-up areas detection in single high-resolution SAR images.

Recently, non-local (NL) means performs well in speckle reduction. However, there exist two issues in traditional NL means. Speckle noise and strong targets would affect the correctness, thus resulting in over smoothing and speckles unchanged. In this paper, an improved algorithm combined with wavelet transform and adaptive NL means is proposed. First, linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) filtering in undecimated wavelet domain is operated and we get a \u201cclean\u201d image. Second, we eliminate the influence of strong targets adaptively when similarity is derived. At last, under the help of similarity, original image rather than the \u201cclean\u201d image is filtered. Proposed method performs better in both speckle reduction and strong targets preserving compared with the traditional method.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729261","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729261.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive SAR image speckle reduction algorithm based on undecimated wavelet transform and non-local means","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729261","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729261/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive SAR image speckle reduction algorithm based on undecimated wavelet transform and non-local means","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16444801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729261/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive SAR image speckle reduction algorithm based on undecimated wavelet transform and non-local means","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097069S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729269,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yang","affiliation":["Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38667435400"},{"name":"Xi Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085422851"},{"name":"Xiaomin Tan","affiliation":["Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085886353"},{"name":"Hongxing Dang","affiliation":["Xi'an Institute of Space Radio Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Dang","id":"37085387530"},{"name":"Kai Wang","affiliation":["Xi'an Information Technique Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085895931"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729269","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","OFDM","Chirp","Doppler effect","Synthetic aperture radar","Sparse matrices","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","object detection","OFDM modulation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground moving target detection","MIMO-SAR system","multiple input multiple output synthetic aperture radar","degrees of freedom","spatial resolution","virtual channel","image swath","signal-to-noise-radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing chirp signal designing analysis","OFDM chirp signal designing analysis","GMTI method","multichannel system","ground moving target indication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR)","ground moving target detection","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","low-rank"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) has drawn widely attention for its increased degrees of freedom. This enhanced architecture offers not only the opportunity to map wider images swaths with improved spatial resolution, but also enables novel SAR modes to resolve some of the contradicting user requirements. In this paper, the performance of ground moving target indication (GMTI) in MIMO-SAR system is analyzed. It becomes evident that the virtual channels can be utilized to fulfill both the image swath and the required signal-to-noise-radio. An analysis on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) chirp signal designing is proposed and a novel GMTI method based on low-rank property is also proposed. Simulation and experimental results show its good performance, which implies that MIMO-SAR would be a good choice for future multichannel systems.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729269","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729269.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground moving target detection in MIMO-SAR system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729269","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ground moving target detection in MIMO-SAR system","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729269/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446192","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7729269/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground moving target detection in MIMO-SAR system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05252S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729277,"authors":[{"name":"Tengfei Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, P.

Compressive sensing (CS) theory, which utilizes the signal sparsity, can implement accurate image reconstruction from an extremely less amount of measurements than what is typically considered necessary in Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. In this paper, the detailed CS SAR image reconstruction model and process is presented in comparison with back-projection algorithm (BPA). Meanwhile, a pseudorandom 2-D subsampling measurement matrix is redesigned by considering the antenna pattern weighting and linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal. The validity and performance of CS technique using this matrix is exhibited by sparse scene simulation results with multi-point targets.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729277","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729277.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing SAR image reconstruction based on a pseudorandom 2-D subsampling measurement matrix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729277","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729277/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing SAR image reconstruction based on a pseudorandom 2-D subsampling measurement matrix","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445087","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729277/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing SAR image reconstruction based on a pseudorandom 2-D subsampling measurement matrix","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052715S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729283,"authors":[{"name":"Guanhua Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Guanhua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085891199"},{"name":"Yaowen Fu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yaowen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37530023800"},{"name":"Lei Nie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Nie","id":"38241702800"},{"name":"Zhaowen Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhaowen","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37085341495"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729283","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","MIMO","Chirp","OFDM","Remote sensing","Genetic algorithms","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","MIMO radar","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal subchirp combination waveform design","MIMO SAR general ambiguity function","multiple input multiple output synthetic aperture radar","orthogonal waveform design","time-bandwidth product","low cross-correlation","low peak-average ratio reduction","imaging performance","GAF","cost function","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple input multiple output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO SAR)","waveform design","general ambiguity function (GAF)","sub-chirp combination waveform"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) shows much potential compared with traditional SAR in many interesting applications, but effective orthogonal waveforms design is still a challenge.

Firstly, we use CIFAR-10 dataset to train a multi-layer network in order for an extraction of the mid-level representation, and then we utilize the intermediate layers of the network trained before to target SAR datasets at which the mid-level representation obtained can be used to train adaptive layers.

For these design purposes, multichannel technology in azimuth is a promising candidate. In the multichannel SAR system, the nonuniform azimuth signal needs to be reconstructed when the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) deviates from a specific one. The traditional digital beamforming (DBF) algorithm works well just in the cases of uniform sampling and moderately nonuniform sampling. If there is highly nonuniform sampling or coinciding sampling, this method may fail. In this paper, a new method to handle the cases of highly nonuniform sampling is proposed. The proposed method is based on an equivalent sampling strategy and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. It is robust over a wide range of PRF. Compared to the conventional algorithms, this method dramatically improves the SNR, which is validated by simulation experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7729364/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445471","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improved DBF algorithm for multichannel SAR with highly nonuniform sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved DBF algorithm for multichannel SAR with highly nonuniform sampling","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047334S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7729371,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad A.

However, manually extracting relevant contextual features is difficult and time-consuming in the analysis of sub-decimetre resolution images, where the objects of interest are significantly larger than the pixel size. Deep learning methods allow us to replace hand-crafted features by automatically learning contextual features from the image. In this paper, we investigate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the classification of urban areas using high resolution airborne images. We also analyse the sensitivity of network hyperparameters providing an interpretation of their effect on the extraction of spatial-contextual features. Experimental results show the effectiveness of CNN in learning discriminative contextual features leading to accurate classified maps and outperforming traditional classification methods based on the extraction of textural features.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729387","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729387.pdf","startPage":"1516","endPage":"1519","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deep learning approach to the classification of sub-decimetre resolution aerial images","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"A deep learning approach to the classification of sub-decimetre resolution aerial images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430059","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7729387/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep learning approach to the classification of sub-decimetre resolution aerial images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052454S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":7729406,"authors":[{"name":"Zilong Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Geography & Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085891566"},{"name":"Jonathan Li","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart Cities, Xiamen University, Xiamen, FJ, China","Department of Geography & Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Li","id":"38107003000"},{"name":"Weihong Cui","affiliation":["School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, China","Collaborative Innovation Center for Geospatial Technology, China","Department of Geography & Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Weihong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37586389400"},{"name":"Han Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Geography & Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085894794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729406","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1136},"abstract":"Available big geoscientific data and modern powerful computation hardware have laid a solid foundation for the prevailing deep learning models in the field of image classification, detection and segmentation.

First, a robust PCA spectrum dictionary is learned from the plausible background area detected by the local RX detector. With the learned dictionary, the reweighted Laplace prior based structured sparse representation model is then employed to reconstruct the spectrum of each pixel in the image. Due to considering the structured sparsity in representation, the background spectra can be reconstructed more accurately than anomaly ones. Thus, reconstruction error is utilized to separate the anomaly pixels and background ones. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729413.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1621","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection using background learning and structured sparse representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Detectors","Hyperspectral imaging","Image reconstruction","Sparse matrices","Principal component analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["background dictionary learning","structured sparse representation based anomaly detection method","hyperspectral imagery","PCA spectrum dictionary","local RX detector","reweighted Laplace prior based structured sparse representation model","image pixel spectrum reconstruction","background spectra","real-world dataset","hyperspectral anomaly detection methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","dictionary learning","structured sparse representation","reweighted Laplace prior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection using background learning and structured sparse representation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729413/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446120","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral anomaly detection using background learning and structured sparse representation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079764S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729424,"authors":[{"name":"Hongtao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hongtao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085898437"},{"name":"Huanfeng Shen","affiliation":["Department of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huanfeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37405266500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729424","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MODIS","Soil moisture","Monitoring","Land surface temperature","Microwave theory and techniques","Land surface","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","land surface temperature","moisture","neural nets","remote sensing","soil","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SMOS soil moisture downscaling","backpropagation neural network","MODIS LST","MODIS EVI","Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity","L-band passive microwave mission","soil moisture monitoring","Tibetan plateau","soil moisture temperature monitoring network","mesoscale SMTMN","AD 2010 to 2012","Naqu","China","land surface temperature","enhanced vegetation index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SMOS","Downscaling","LST & EVI","MODIS","SMTMN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729424","abstract":"Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) is the first L-band passive microwave mission dedicated to soil moisture (SM) monitoring but has coarse resolution.

The performance of the proposed model is validated on a five target-class problem and compared with a benchmark random forest classifier with a set of hand-picked features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445721","htmlLink":"/document/7729461/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Large urban zone classification on SPOT-5 imagery with convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large urban zone classification on SPOT-5 imagery with convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05033S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729468,"authors":[{"name":"Lichao Mou","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany"],"firstName":"Lichao","lastName":"Mou","id":"37076570200"},{"name":"Xiao Xiang Zhu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute (IMF), German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany"],"firstName":"Xiao Xiang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085896192"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729468","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":638},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Labeling","Tracking","Estimation","Satellites","Remote sensing","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image fusion","neural nets","remote sensing","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal scene interpretation","deep neural network","tracklet analysis","spaceborne remote sensing video","remote sensing application","semantic scene interpretation","spatial video resolution","moving object","camera movement handicap","spatiotemporal analysis","spaceborne video","fine-resolution spatial scene labeling map","traffic density","traffic activity","Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi keypoint tracker","AD 2016","GRSS data fusion contest","international space station","DEIMOS-2 multispectral image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space videos","scene labeling","deep learning","activity analysis","traffic density estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729468","abstract":"Spaceborne remote sensing videos are becoming indispensable resources, opening up opportunities for new remote sensing applications. To exploit this new type of data, we need sophisticated algorithms for semantic scene interpretation. The main difficulties are: 1) Due to the relatively poor spatial resolution of the video acquired from space, moving objects, like cars, are very difficult to detect, not to mention track; 2) camera movement handicaps scene interpretation. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel framework that fuses multispectral images and space videos for spatiotemporal analysis. Taking a multispectral image and a spaceborne video as input, an innovative deep neural network is proposed to fuse them in order to achieve a fine-resolution spatial scene labeling map. Moreover, a sophisticated approach is proposed to analyze activities and estimate traffic density from 150,000+ tracklets produced by a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi keypoint tracker. The proposed framework is validated using data provided for the 2016 IEEE GRSS data fusion contest, including a video acquired from the International Space Station and a DEIMOS-2 multispectral image. Both visual and quantitative analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729468","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729468.pdf","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal scene interpretation of space videos via deep neural network and tracklet analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal scene interpretation of space videos via deep neural network and tracklet analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729468/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445381","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal scene interpretation of space videos via deep neural network and tracklet analysis","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078069S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7729471,"authors":[{"name":"Zuming Huang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Institute of Automation, Beijing, P.R.

Yet it is a longstanding problem for many complicate factors such as various scales and complex backgrounds. This paper proposes a novel supervised building extraction method via deep deconvolution neural networks (DeconvNet). Our method consists of three steps. First, we preprocess the multi-source remote sensing images provided by the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest. A high-quality Vancouver building dataset is created on pansharpened images whose ground-truth are obtained from the OpenStreetMap project. Then, we pretrain a deep deconvolution network on a public large-scale Massachusetts building dataset, which is further fine-tuned by two band combinations (RGB and NRG) of our dataset, respectively. Moreover, the output saliency maps of the fine-tuned models are fused to produce the final building extraction result. Extensive experiments on our Vancouver building dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to use deconvolution networks for building extraction from remote sensing images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Deconvolution","Feature extraction","Remote sensing","Training","Image resolution","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buildings (structures)","feature extraction","geophysical image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Massachusetts building dataset","OpenStreetMap project","pansharpened images","Vancouver building dataset","IEEE GRSS data fusion contest","multisource remote sensing image preprocessing","supervised building extraction method","urban planning","deep deconvolution neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Building extraction","DeconvNet","multi-source","remote sensing","band combination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729471","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729471","startPage":"1835","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729471.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729471","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729471/","displayDocTitle":"Building extraction from multi-source remote sensing images via deep deconvolution neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16446254","htmlLink":"/document/7729471/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building extraction from multi-source remote sensing images via deep deconvolution neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050725S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7729475,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, P.R.

Meanwhile, the inherent nonlinearity of hyperspectral images may cover up the intrinsic data structure in the anomaly detection process. This paper for the first time aims to implement robust background representation, as well as to explore the intrinsic data structure of the hyperspectral imagery simultaneously. Robust background dataset and potential anomaly dataset are firstly assigned by a robust background regression (RBR) procedure. In the RBR, a minimum squared loss relationship is constructed between the nonlinear data density feature and the corresponding assigned labels, to formulate the foundation of the regression. Furthermore, a manifold regularization term and a robust background average margin maximization term are jointly appended in the RBR procedure. After this, a paired-dataset based k-nn score estimation is undertaken to implement the detection output.

In this paper, we propose a novel low rank anomaly detection algorithm in hyperspectral images (HSI), where three components are involved. First, due to the highly mixed nature of pixels in HSI, instead of using the raw pixel directly for anomaly detection, the proposed algorithm applies spectral unmixing algorithms to obtain the abundance vectors and uses these vectors for anomaly detection. Second, for better classification, a dictionary is built based on the mean-shift clustering of the abundance vectors to better represent the highly-correlated background and the sparse anomaly. Finally, a low-rank matrix decomposition is proposed to encourage the sparse coefficients of the dictionary to be low-rank, and the residual matrix to be sparse. Anomalies can then be extracted by summing up the columns of the residual matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach constantly achieves high detection rate while maintaining low false alarm rate regardless of the type of images tested.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729476.pdf","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1858","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in hyperspectral images through spectral unmixing and low rank decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Clustering algorithms","Dictionaries","Sparse matrices","Feature extraction","Algorithm design and analysis","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral imaging","image classification","matrix decomposition","pattern clustering","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral images","spectral unmixing","low rank anomaly detection algorithm","HSI","spectral unmixing algorithms","abundance vectors","mean-shift clustering","highly-correlated background","sparse anomaly","low-rank matrix decomposition","sparse coefficients","residual matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral image","anomaly detection","mesn-shift clustering","low-rank","sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in hyperspectral images through spectral unmixing and low rank decomposition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16445331","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in hyperspectral images through spectral unmixing and low rank decomposition","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0001855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069239S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729521,"authors":[{"name":"Todd Gaier","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Gaier","id":"37269117400"},{"name":"Pekka Kangaslahti","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Kangaslahti","id":"37269569000"},{"name":"Bjorn Lambrigtsen","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Lambrigtsen","id":"37269391400"},{"name":"Isaac Ramos-Perez","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Ramos-Perez","id":"38276095000"},{"name":"Alan Tanner","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Tanner","id":"37269112900"},{"name":"Darren McKague","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Darren","lastName":"McKague","id":"37330668800"},{"name":"Christopher Ruf","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Ruf","id":"37269563800"},{"name":"Michael Flynn","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Flynn","id":"37893185300"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Zhengya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088723875"},{"name":"Roger Backhus","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Backhus","id":"37088728291"},{"name":"David Austerberry","affiliation":["University of Michigan"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Austerberry","id":"37085698729"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"abstract":"GeoSTAR-III, a 180 GHz prototype for the Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity Sounder (PATH), is the culmination of a decade of technology development funding.

The GMNCC can detect the angle-offsets (AOs) of object images to reference image by determining the maximum of correlation coefficients between the two images with genetic algorithm, and complete the rotation offset correction. Then SIFT is used to extract the feature points and feature matching, which is subsequently refined by RANSAC to eliminate the false matched control points. Two Woldview-2 (WV2) images of Beijing Olympic Forest Park were used for testing the GMNCC-SIFT registration. GMNCC detects more accurate rotation angle-offsets than multi-angle normalized cross correlation (MANCC), reduces the detection process from 3000s to 2500s, and gives more matched points than simple SIFT to improve registration accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729668/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16444925","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729668/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic-optimized multi-angle normalized cross correlation SIFT for automatic remote sensing registration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic-optimized multi-angle normalized cross correlation SIFT for automatic remote sensing registration","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0002586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079351S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7729674,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengzheng Fang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"],"firstName":"Zhengzheng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085905699"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"38065632800"},{"name":"Jinyi Zou","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"],"firstName":"Jinyi","lastName":"Zou","id":"37085384668"},{"name":"Qian Du","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Du","id":"37085889458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729674","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Remote sensing","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Convergence","Machine learning","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","image classification","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-based high-level features","remote sensing scene classification","convolutional neural networks","semantic features","limited labeled samples","CaffeNet model","pretrained architecture","fine-tuning","remote-sensing scene datasets","CNN-based scene classification method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scene classification","convolutional neural networks","feature extraction","deep learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729674.pdf","startPage":"2610","endPage":"2613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using CNN-based high-level features for remote sensing scene classification","abstract":"In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is employed for remote-sensing scene classification, which fully utilizes the semantic features extracted from the images while ignoring some traditional features.

It is found that most anomalies are around the Longmenshan fault zone, indicating that LST change detection is effective in this area for precursor study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal anomaly detection for 2013 Lushan earthquake","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729736","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729736.pdf","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729736","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Thermal anomaly detection for 2013 Lushan earthquake","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729736/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16446029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal anomaly detection for 2013 Lushan earthquake","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0002849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05172S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7729749,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Lv","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085891370"},{"name":"Jintai Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"],"firstName":"Jintai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085897181"},{"name":"Weiqiang Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"],"firstName":"Weiqiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085888423"},{"name":"Xiaomin Bao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Bao","id":"37085890561"},{"name":"Xiaocheng Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University"],"firstName":"Xiaocheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085885997"},{"name":"Long Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University","Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Networks, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085892455"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729749","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar polarimetry","Imaging","Marine vehicles","Radar imaging","Clutter","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","feature extraction","greedy algorithms","radar clutter","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR imaging","feature analysis","compressed sensing","synthetic aperture radar imaging","CS","greedy algorithm","target scattering coefficient","point spread effect removal","clutter method","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar imaging","compressed sensing","feature extraction","clutter method"]}],"abstract":"A scheme of feature analysis in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging based on compressed sensing (CS) is presented.

Continuous detection of anomalies is important for studying spatial-temporal processes of land cover changes. Although many time-series-analysis methods have been developed for change detection, to the best of our knowledge, few methods focus on continuously detecting anomalies in satellite image time series. This study proposes a method for continuous anomaly detection in satellite image time series based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals (ZSTR). The ability of ZSTR for continuous anomaly detection was validated with an experiment for detecting spatial-temporal anomaly regions caused by severe flooding.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729881","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729881.pdf","startPage":"3410","endPage":"3413","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous anomaly detection in satellite image time series based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Continuous anomaly detection in satellite image time series based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16430074","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7729881/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous anomaly detection in satellite image time series based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0003410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050812S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7729882,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng-Guang Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Quantitative Remote Sensing Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zeng-Guang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085893729"},{"name":"Ping Tang","affiliation":["Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Tang","id":"37897550700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3332-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3331-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3333-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"7729882","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7729882","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Satellites","Floods","Remote sensing","MODIS","Control charts","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floods","geophysical image processing","spatiotemporal phenomena","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series anomaly detection","exponentially weighted moving average","season trend model residuals","continuous anomaly detection","satellite image time series","spatial-temporal processes","land cover changes","severe flooding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Temporal analysis","land cover","change detection","disturbance detection","time series analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729882","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592514/7728980/07729882.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","startPage":"3414","endPage":"3417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving time series anomaly detection based on exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of season-trend model residuals","abstract":"Continuous anomaly detection in satellite image time series is important for studying spatial-temporal processes of land cover changes. In another study, we proposed a method based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals (Z-STR), which can continuously detects anomaly regions in image time series. However, Z-STR only detects anomalies with large shifts but cannot detect anomalies with small or gradual shifts. To improve the effectiveness of continuous anomaly detection, in this study, we propose a new method based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of Season-Trend model Residuals (EWMA-STR). Experiment for detecting spatial-temporal anomaly regions caused by severe flooding validated the better performance of EWMA-STR than Z-STR for time series anomaly detection. By using information of all historical time series data, EWMA-STR can detects anomalies with small or gradual shifts as well as anomalies with large or abrupt shifts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7729882/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16430125","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7729882/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving time series anomaly detection based on exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of season-trend model residuals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving time series anomaly detection based on exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of season-trend model residuals","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0003414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039426S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592514","isNumber":"7728980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592514","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7728980","articleId":"7729882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"}]
