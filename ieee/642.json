It has been shown that in this way also the heart activity can be detected if the fibre is in direct or indirect contact with human body. The measured interferometric signal must be first demodulated and band-pass filtered to separate superimposed contributions of signal components. Only then their detection and classification is feasible. In this paper, we deploy feedforward neural network for detecting the first heart sound (S1) from fibre-optic interferometric signals. A reliable and robust classification of S1 and finding its location in time importantly support diagnosing of cardiac arrhythmias and valve abnormalities. Our experimental results on a group of ten healthy subjects that underwent submaximal stress testing before fibre-optic measurements yield 98.2\u00b11.5% and 98.4\u00b10.9% for sensitivity and precision of S1 detection, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/NEUREL.2012.6420001","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"11th Symposium on Neural Network Applications in Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409519/6419933/06420001.pdf","publicationTitle":"11th Symposium on Neural Network Applications in Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEUREL.2012.6420001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6419933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of the first heart sound using fibre-optic interferometric measurements and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical interferometry","Neural networks","Electrocardiography","Band pass filters","Heart beat"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","feedforward neural nets","fibre optic sensors","light interferometry","medical signal processing","phonocardiography","signal classification","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first heart sound detection","fibre-optic interferometric measurements","optical fibre length","interferometric signal","band-pass filtering","feedforward neural network","robust classification","S1 detection","phonocardiography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fibre-optic interferometry","feedforward neural network","human cardiac activity","phonocardiography","first heart sound detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Detection of the first heart sound using fibre-optic interferometric measurements and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13266468","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of the first heart sound using fibre-optic interferometric measurements and neural networks","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"066RS4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052336S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409519","isNumber":"6419933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409519","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6419933","articleId":"6420001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6420014,"authors":[{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE), Institute of Technology Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38469538300"},{"name":"Pankaj Kumar Deswal","affiliation":["EEE Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"],"lastName":"Pankaj Kumar Deswal","id":"38547206700"},{"name":"Jatin Mehta","affiliation":["EEE Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Jatin","lastName":"Mehta","id":"38547038300"},{"name":"Amit Sethi","affiliation":["EEE Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Sethi","id":"37413753600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1572-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1569-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1571-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6420014","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420014","abstract":"In this paper a novel learning based technique for single image super resolution (SR) is proposed.

This assumption is likely to be violated in practical settings as new fault types can emerge over time. In this paper we study this often overlooked cold start learning problem in data-driven fault detection, where in the beginning only normal operation data are available and faulty operation data become available as the faults occur. We explored how to leverage strengths of unsupervised and supervised approaches to build a model capable of detecting faults even if none are still observed, and of improving over time, as new fault types are observed. The proposed framework was evaluated on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process data. The proposed fusion model performed better on both unseen and seen faults than the stand-alone unsupervised and supervised models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6420042/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843488","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cold Start Approach for Data-Driven Fault Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cold Start Approach for Data-Driven Fault Detection","sourcePdf":"tii-grbovic-2231870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090077S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6631519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6631519","articleId":"6420042","onlineDate":"24 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6420146,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

The phone number for his office was originally black. Now it's displayed in blinking red letters, a sign that the number was changed recently. The electronics in this scenario are not far off; in fact the basic technological breakthroughs needed to make them work have all been achieved in the past few years. At the moment the costs are still too high for them to be used in things like business cards or package labels, but remarkable advances in materials science and simpler fabrication methods are setting the stage for a whole new breed of cheap, bendable, disposable, and perhaps even recyclable electronics.

The geometry of a through hole consists of traces, pads and a perfectly conducting hollow cylinder. Conductive Anodic Filament (CAF) generated easily in PCB when board size is decreased. CAF produced will lead to leakages or short circuit. Many reasons cause the phenomenon of the CAF, one of them is the voltage. In these situations, the signal transmission integrity is concerned. The excessive capacitance is generated near the through hole structure. Such capacitance influences the signal transmission between different layers. A number of factors can cause excessive capacitance, for example: geometry of transmission line, pad of through hole and the interaction of different layers. However, recent application of the multilayered printed circuit board such as cell phones and note books, have decreased the broad size for easy to carry or load more equipment. Decreasing the size of PCB, the excessive capacitance near the through hole structure is inevitable. It is more important to design the complexity of the layout and the geometry of structure. The quick and efficient prediction of the performance is concerned when manufacturing process become more complicated. The simulation model and problem discussion are the subject of this paper. In this study, we demonstrate that the geometry of the transmission line near the through hole may affect the transmission of the signal by excessive capacitance. By using ANSYS 12 to simulate the high frequency electromagnetism, and simulate the transmission line with different shapes near the through hole and extract the Scattering-parameters from the simulation results. Scattering-parameters are used to describe the electrical behavior of linear electrical network. The parameters are helpful for us to design electrical engineering, electronics engineering, and communication systems, and especially for microwave engineering. By comparing Scattering-parameters of different structures, we can understand the signal transmission and reflectivity between two layers. We also analyze the electric field and magnetic field of the structure, and use a method based on the quasi-static approximation to compute the excessive capacitance of the through hole structure. Using the concept of equivalent circuit to convert the original model into the RLC circuit. Equivalent circuit is divided into multiple series parts. Many parameters such as resistance, capacitance, inductance and characteristic impedance will be discussed, then compare these value changes between different shapes of the transmission line near the through hole. The ANSYS model is proposed to simulate the high-frequency electromagnetic of the structure. By these model, we want to predict the signal transmission performance of the through hole structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits

alternative to heart rate variability (HRV) which will save the need of electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. 21 polysomnographic registers from children whose age was 4.47 \u00b1 2.04 (mean \u00b1 SD) years were manually labeled as OSAS (10 children) or not (11 children) following standard clinical procedures. Then DAP events were automatically detected and classified as apneic or non apneic by a linear discriminant analysis whose features come from the PRV. Subsequently, the apneic DAP event per hour index was used to discriminate OSAS from non-OSAS children. Results show an improvement in accuracy of subject classification with respect to the HRV analysis of 6.7%, reaching a 86.7% (100% for sensitivity and 71.4% for specificity). These results suggest that PRV can be used to discriminate apneic and non-apneic DAP events without introducing any additional signal and so a decision from just the PPG with same results as if the ECG were also considered, which takes special relevance in sleep studies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420314","publicationTitle":"2012 Computing in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Computing in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414852/6420314/06420361.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OSAS detection in children by using PPG amplitude fluctuation decreases and pulse rate variability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"OSAS detection in children by using PPG amplitude fluctuation decreases and pulse rate variability","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6420361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13266535","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420361/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OSAS detection in children by using PPG amplitude fluctuation decreases and pulse rate variability","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"0185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042706S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414852","isNumber":"6420314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414852","xplore-issue":"6420314","articleId":"6420361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CCAL","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6420463,"authors":[{"name":"Heriberto Zavala-Fernandez","affiliation":["Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, PAS, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Heriberto","lastName":"Zavala-Fernandez","id":"38548696000"},{"name":"Michal Kania","affiliation":["Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, PAS, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Kania","id":"37393995800"},{"name":"Roman Maniewski","affiliation":["Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, PAS, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Maniewski","id":"37297631600"},{"name":"Dariusz Janusek","affiliation":["Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, PAS, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Janusek","id":"37394105300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2077-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2076-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2075-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-8853"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0276-6574"},{"format":"CD","value":"2325-8861"}],"articleNumber":"6420463","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"abstract":"The application of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is now an accepted technique in the feld of biosignal processing.

We formulate a pricing based video utility function for H.264 based wireless scalable video streaming, thereby achieving a trade-off between price and QoS fairness. These parametric models for scalable video rate and quality characterization are derived form the standard JSVM reference codec for the SVC extension of the H.264/AVC, and hence are directly applicable in practical wireless scenarios. With the aid of these models, we propose a novel auction based framework for revenue maximization of the transmitted video streams in the unicast and multicast 4G scenario. A closed form expression is derived for the optimal scalable video quantization step-size subject to the constraints of the unicast/multicast users in the 4G wireless systems. This yields the optimal OFDMA subcarrier allocation for multi-user scalable video multiplexing. Further, the proposed scheme is cognizant of the user modulation and code rate, and is hence amenable to adaptive modulation and coding(AMC) feature of 4G wireless networks.

The proposed power allocation scheme minimizes the overall video distortion while restricting secondary user interference. For this purpose, we employ the two level Daubechies wavelet D2 to encode the video as a layered scalable stream comprising of one Base layer and several enhancement layers. The coded video layers are assigned to the secondary OFDM subcarriers of the CR user. A convex optimization framework is developed for video distortion as a function of the subcarrier power allocation. We employ this framework and derive a closed form expression towards the optimal power allocation for video quality maximization. We also propose a low complexity scheme for near optimal video transmission. The performances of the proposed optimal schemes are compared in terms of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the received video stream in the OFDM CR wireless system. Presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimal scheme results in a significantly enhanced PSNR of video transmission compared to the competing scalable and non-scalable schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420583.pdf","startPage":"024","endPage":"029","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DWT based optimal power allocation schemes for scalable video transmission in OFDM based cognitive radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Interference","Streaming media","Wireless communication","PSNR","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convex programming","discrete wavelet transforms","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DWT","optimal power allocation scheme","scalable video transmission","cognitive radio system","optimal power loading algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","video distortion","secondary user interference","Daubechies wavelet","base layer","enhancement layer","coded video layer","convex optimization framework","subcarrier power allocation","video quality maximization","OFDM CR wireless system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"DWT based optimal power allocation schemes for scalable video transmission in OFDM based cognitive radio systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420583/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355658","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DWT based optimal power allocation schemes for scalable video transmission in OFDM based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060298S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6420590,"authors":[{"name":"Sumantra Sarkar","affiliation":["IBM India Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sumantra","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"38546705900"},{"name":"Anindya Sundar Dhar","affiliation":["ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Anindya Sundar","lastName":"Dhar","id":"37265601900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2272-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2270-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2271-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6420590","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architectural design of zoomable real time spectrum analyzer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Discrete Fourier transforms","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Equations","Real-time systems","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","pipeline processing","signal processing","spectral analysers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architectural design","zoomable real time spectrum analyzer","pipelined architecture","hardware economic spectrum analyzer","zooming capability","sliding window DFT algorithm","CORDIC","coordinate rotation digital computer module","XILINX Spartan3 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sliding window","Fourier Transform","VLSI Architecture","Zoomable Spectrum","CORDIC"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum analyzer is perhaps the most useful instrument that finds its application in almost every branch of engineering.

Therefore, this paper presents a FinFET-based 8T SRAM cell to mitigate impact of process variation. In this work, various design metrics are assessed and compared with MOSFET-based RD8T SRAM cell. The proposed design offers 4.35\u00d7 and 1.86\u00d7 improvements in TRA (read access time) and TWA (write access time) respectively compared to RD8T. It proves its robustness against process variations by featuring narrower spread in TRA distribution (6.95\u00d7) and TWA distribution (5.04\u00d7) compared with RD8T. These improvements are achieved at the expense of 11.65\u00d7 higher read power and 13.75\u00d7 higher write power.

These radios have to load different waveform depending on their requirements which may use different source coding, channel coding and modulation schemes. The user has to load large bit files even for small changes in the waveforms. In SDRs and CRs the configuration time and current consumption plays significant role: for example, a virtex-7 FPGA takes 500ms to complete configuration. If the waveforms design is made Partially Reconfigurable then the configuration time and the Hardware usage can be saved. The Objective of this work is to make the Modulation and demodulation (PSK) Schemes partially reconfigurable. The paper describes the Design and Implementation of Phase Shift keying (PSK) Modulation and demodulation in FPGA using Partial Re-configuration (PR). This work involves the Design and implementation of BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-PSK modulation and demodulation schemes in FPGA. The user can swap between different modulation and demodulation schemes during runtime by configuring a control register in FPGA. The Implementation of these PSKs shares a common hardware, which is the Static Part and there is a Dynamic part too. In the PR, the user has to load the bit stream for the Dynamic part only, and not the entire bit stream. This will be smaller in size compared to the large bit file. The modulator design consists of two DDS modules and the demodulator part consists of a four DDS modules, which forms the static part of the design. By designing the entire waveform using partial Reconfiguration, the waveform can be made as part of the Platform realized and the configuration time and power consumption can be very much reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420616.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of PSK modems using partial re-configuration for SDR and CR applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Mathematical model","Field programmable gate arrays","Phase shift keying","Generators","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","demodulation","field programmable gate arrays","modems","modulation","phase shift keying","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","PSK modems","software defined radios","cognitive radios","source coding","channel coding","phase shift keying modulation","demodulation","partial reconfiguration","demodulator","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDR","CR","Partial Reconfiguration","FPGA","SoC","DDS","RTL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of PSK modems using partial re-configuration for SDR and CR applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420616/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355690","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of PSK modems using partial re-configuration for SDR and CR applications","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045025S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6420624,"authors":[{"name":"Nabajyoti Medhi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Nabajyoti","lastName":"Medhi","id":"38235515500"},{"name":"Nityananda Sarma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Nityananda","lastName":"Sarma","id":"37323906100"},{"name":"Arifuzzaman Mira","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur University, Tezpur, India"],"firstName":"Arifuzzaman","lastName":"Mira","id":"38547718600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2272-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2270-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2271-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6420624","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","MIMO","Mobile communication","Wireless sensor networks","Energy consumption","Receivers","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","MIMO communication","mobile radio","protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative MIMO","wireless sensor networks","mobile sensors","cooperativeness","data aggregation","long range communications","LEACH","low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Energy Efficiency","Cooperative MISO","mobility"]}],"abstract":"Optimality in energy usage of sensors in wireless sensor network (WSN) is a very crucial matter. Long range communications in WSNs are affected by factors like fading of channel, interference and radio irregularity. Cooperative MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) communication in WSNs proves helpful to solve these problems of long range transmission. In this paper we propose a cooperative MISO (Multiple Input Single Output) communication model (A variant of MIMO) with modified LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol where a few mobile sensors (MS) using Alamouti diversity schemes take part in cooperative communication along with the normal sensors. A mobile sensor can move to a specific location of the field to take part in cooperative communication with other sensors. Normal sensors only sense the environment, gather the data, compress and take part in cooperative communication. Mobile sensors (usually do not sense) are responsible for cooperative transmission and reception and they have higher capacity in terms of battery power and communication range than the normal ones. This model of communication helps in achieving both uniform energy expenditures by the nodes and a good average lifetime for the network. By choosing some costly mobile sensors, this modified LEACH MISO model can avoid the problems of energy expenditure in cooperative node selection as well as nonuniformity in sensors death. This model helps in long range communication where many intermediate communication takes place before reaching the base station e.g., WSN in border security navigation, forest river bank for intrusion detection etc. Simulation results demonstrate the working strategy of the proposed model and show how this model can overpower any existing LEACH based MIMO model by avoiding some disadvantages of LEACH protocol.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420624","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420624.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative MIMO in wireless sensor networks with mobile sensors for cooperativeness and data aggregation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420624/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative MIMO in wireless sensor networks with mobile sensors for cooperativeness and data aggregation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355698","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420624/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative MIMO in wireless sensor networks with mobile sensors for cooperativeness and data aggregation","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095003S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6420629,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Das","id":"38244429600"},{"name":"Suraj Dash","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Suraj","lastName":"Dash","id":"38243563700"},{"name":"A.K.

The compression in file size permits more images to be stored in the available amount of memory space. It also decreases the time needed for images to be uploaded over the Internet or downloaded from it. There are many techniques available in the lossy image compression, in which wavelet transform based image compression is the best technique. Vector Quantization (VQ) is the most powerful tool for image compression. One of the major steps in the Vector Quantization is the generation of the code book. In this proposed approach, a popular neural network technique called Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach is used to generate the code book. A combined approach of image compression based on vector quantization and wavelet transform is proposed using RBF neural network. This approach will be very helpful for medical imaging, criminal investigation where high precision reconstructed image is required. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique provides better PSNR value and also reduces the Mean Square Error value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420640/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13355713","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420640/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image compression: Wavelet transform using radial basis function (RBF) neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression: Wavelet transform using radial basis function (RBF) neural network","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073662S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420656,"authors":[{"name":"R Aneesh.","affiliation":["ER & DCI-IT, C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Aneesh."},{"name":"K Jiju.","affiliation":["Power Electronics Group, C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Jiju."}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2272-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2270-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2271-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-940X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-9418"}],"articleNumber":"6420656","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":599},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of FPGA based 8-bit RISC controller IP core using VHDL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420656","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Ports (Computers)","Microcontrollers","Reduced instruction set computing","Radiation detectors","IP networks","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["8 bit RISC controller IP core","VHDL","very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language","nonpipelined controller","stage control unit","data memory","behavioral programming","structural programming","ALTERA STRATIX II FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RISC CPU","Microcontoller design","VHDL","IP core"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design, development and implementation of an 8-bit RISC controller IP core.

Bit error rate (BER) is the key performance indicator of an efficient network system. This paper evaluates the performance of a static CDMA wireless sensor network (WSN) in terms of BER, where the positions of nodes are more likely to be random. Data generated from the source node are received by the sink via multi hop. An intermediate node in the route selects the nearest node within a sector angle, considered as search angle, towards the direction of the destination as the next hop. Effects of node density, and search angle on average number of hops, average route BER are investigated. Average route BER is also estimated by incorporating automatic rate control (ARC) technique while maintaining a specific link BER, as applicable to WSN, and compared with the results obtained without using such automatic control.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420663","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420663.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multi hop CDMA wireless sensor networks with nearest neighbors based routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420663/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multi hop CDMA wireless sensor networks with nearest neighbors based routing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355735","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420663/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multi hop CDMA wireless sensor networks with nearest neighbors based routing","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060835S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6420665,"authors":[{"name":"Finto Raphel","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Finto","lastName":"Raphel","id":"38548015100"},{"name":"S.

In order to facilitate the estimation of it without employing computationally expensive processing at the relays, we propose a new model for relaying which we denote as multi input multi output (MIMO) mimicking (MM) AF model. In this model, we consider a generic AF system with one source node (SN), one DN and M relay nodes (RN). The model works well with any space time coding (STC) technique. The MM AF model helps estimating the interim channel by means of a predefined pilot enhancement matrix (PEM) at RN and the corresponding overall channel estimation performed at DN from the pilots broad casted from SN. The channel estimation algorithm is based on linear least square estimation (LSE) technique. The performance advantages of this new model and estimation technique are substantiated through simulation studies and are compared with that of a relevant method available in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","startPage":"476","endPage":"480","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420665.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012

Wavelets are mathematical functions with time-frequency representation for analysis of signal with transient features. The process starts with retrieving the three-phase voltage signals at the target DG location and each phase will be processed through Wavelet Transform (WT) to derive detailed co-efficient at different levels of decompositions. The next step is to compute Wavelet Singular Entropy (WSE) for each phase from the detailed coefficients. Then WSE Index (WSEI) for islanding detection is derived by adding WSE of each phase. The comparison of proposed algorithm with the widely used Rate Of Change Of Frequency (ROCOF) and Rate Of Change Of Voltage (ROCOV) relays suggests WSEI based relay working effectively in the situations where ROCOF and ROCOV fails to do so. The proposed WSEI relay is tested on standard micro-grid structures with possible variations in operating parameters and the results indicate that the WSEI relay can reliably detect islanding conditions in large micro-grids.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420678","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420678.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of wavelet transform based islanding detection relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420678/","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of wavelet transform based islanding detection relay","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355750","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420678/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of wavelet transform based islanding detection relay","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059987S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6420680,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Compressive sensing exploits the sparsity of a signal and allows the digital signal to be reconstructed from far fewer measurements than the original size of the signal. This is possible as long as the measurements satisfy certain reasonable conditions such as Restricted Isometry Property, Incoherence, etc. The theory of compressed sensing can also be applied to the field of sensor array processing . In this paper, compressive sensing is applied to the problem of Direction of Arrival estimation. We perform Compressive Beamforming using two different approaches. In the time domain approach, CS can be applied to reduce the sampling rate of the Analog-to-Digital Converter, i.e., the number of samples received by each sensor of the array. In the spatial domain approach, CS can be applied to compress the array of large number of elements into an array of much smaller number of elements. Both these approaches are compared to the conventional beamforming technique and found to be close to the ideal impulse output. Compressed sensing recovery is performed using Subspace Pursuit (SP) and the two approaches are compared. The results obtained using SP is found to outperform the results obtained in the previous papers.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420680","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420680.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","startPage":"555","endPage":"560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for array signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for array signal processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420680/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355752","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6420680/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for array signal processing","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059257S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6420689,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The method makes use of Bernstein basis polynomials (BBP) for capturing the time variation of the channel. By representing the channel in terms of basis functions, we need to track only the slowly varying basis expansion coefficients instead of the actual channel impulse response. These basis expansion coefficients are tracked via Kalman filtering approach by assuming an autoregressive (AR) model for basis expansion model (BEM) coefficients. Simulation studies demonstrate that the BBP with Kalman tracking gives excellent performance even at high mobile velocities.","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420689","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410222/6420575/06420689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2012.6420689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420575","startPage":"603","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly-selective channel estimation for OFDM systems using Bernstein basis polynomials and Kalman-tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Doubly-selective channel estimation for OFDM systems using Bernstein basis polynomials and Kalman-tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420689/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13355761","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6420689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly-selective channel estimation for OFDM systems using Bernstein basis polynomials and Kalman-tracking","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"INDICON2012550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069429S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410222","isNumber":"6420575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410222","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6420575","articleId":"6420689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6420707,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Through reduced-dimension transform, the angles can be obtained via two one-dimensional peak searches, and the array gain-phase error can be estimated by utilizing the estimated angles. The proposed algorithm can achieve automatically paired estimations of the angles, and is suitable for non-uniform linear array. For the case of separately-located ca-librated sensors, the algorithm can also work well. Furthermore, it has better angle and array gain-phase error estimation performance than the ESPRIT-like algorithm. The simulation results verify the algorithmic effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06420816.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012313.122113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012313.122113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Dimension MUSIC for Angle and Array Gain-Phase Error Estimation in Bistatic MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Error analysis","MIMO radar","Sensor arrays","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","calibration","MIMO radar","phase estimation","sensors","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-dimension MUSIC transform","angle estimation","nonuniform linear array gain-phase error estimation","bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar","MIMO","multiple signal classification","one-dimensional peak searching","separately-located calibrated sensor","ESPRIT-like algorithm","performance estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output radar","gain-phase error","reduced-dimension","multiple signal classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Dimension MUSIC for Angle and Array Gain-Phase Error Estimation in Bistatic MIMO Radar","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6420816/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13401519","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Dimension MUSIC for Angle and Array Gain-Phase Error Estimation in Bistatic MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"443-cl1303-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053875S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6420816","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6420817,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536304700"},{"name":"Yong Fang","affiliation":["School of Communication & Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, P.

Instrumental to the RA algorithm design is appropriate definition of variables to represent source/relay power allocation, subcarrier pairing and transmission-mode selection elegantly, so that after continuous relaxation, the dual method and the Hungarian algorithm can be used to find an (at least approximately) optimum RA with polynomial complexity. Moreover, the bisection method is used to speed up the search of the optimum Lagrange multiplier for the dual method.

While it is expectable for channel coding to improve the performance in the secondary service compared to the uncoded case at the expense of rate reduction, our results indicate that the benefits of such utilization is beyond expectation. In fact we show that for a given bandwidth and bit error rate performance, the coded scheme not only requires less average transmit power per subcarrier, but it also provides a significantly higher sum-rate compared to the uncoded case. This result is against the well-known property of channel coding in conventional communication systems where we sacrifice effective date rate to reduce the required power for a given bit error rate. This is due to the fact that using TCM in the secondary system, we successfully transmit bits with a lower transmit power. Having a transmission with lower transmit power, we would be able to transmit with a higher bit rate in the secondary system and still meet the interference threshold requirements in the primary network. Total rate is increased if the increase due to lower transmit power beats the decrease caused by coding. Our simulation results show that this is indeed the case for TCM-OFDMA secondary system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13401521","htmlLink":"/document/6420818/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Coding Increases the Achievable Rate of the Cognitive Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Coding Increases the Achievable Rate of the Cognitive Networks","sourcePdf":"495-cl1303-mokari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047331S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6420818","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420819,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiping Shi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Shi","id":"37404130100"},{"name":"Kah Chan Teh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kah Chan","lastName":"Teh","id":"37280857900"},{"name":"Kwok Hung Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kwok Hung","lastName":"Li","id":"37277624900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6420819","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":913},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Interference","Joints","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Linear programming","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio systems","transmission durations","sensing durations","energy-efficient joint design","primary user protection","energy-efficient sensing","optimal solutions","suboptimal algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy efficiency","interference","sensing duration","transmission duration"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a joint design of energy-efficient sensing and transmission durations for a cognitive radio (CR) system in which the primary user (PU) is protected.

This is a powerful model with a conditional distribution over the input that is Gaussian, with both mean and covariance determined by the configuration of latent variables, which is unlike previous models that were restricted to using Gaussians with either a fixed mean or a diagonal covariance matrix. Thanks to the increased flexibility, this gated MRF can generate more realistic samples after training on an unconstrained distribution of high-resolution natural images. Furthermore, the latent variables of the model can be inferred efficiently and can be used as very effective descriptors in recognition tasks. Both generation and discrimination drastically improve as layers of binary latent variables are added to the model, yielding a hierarchical model called a Deep Belief Network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6560338/06420839.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.29","startPage":"2206","endPage":"2222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Natural Images Using Gated MRFs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420839/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Natural Images Using Gated MRFs","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420839/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"13639693","pubMedId":"23868780","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Natural Images Using Gated MRFs","sourcePdf":"ttp2013092206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174438S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6560338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6560338","articleId":"6420839","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420841,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Domke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, SHOU University 1, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, ROC"],"bio":{"p":["Justin Domke received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2009.

To track such objects, we develop a local patch-based appearance model and provide an efficient online updating scheme that adaptively changes the topology between patches. In the online update process, the robustness of each patch is determined by analyzing the likelihood landscape of the patch. Based on this robustness measure, the proposed method selects the best feature for each patch and modifies the patch by moving, deleting, or newly adding it over time. Moreover, a rough object segmentation result is integrated into the proposed appearance model to further enhance it. The proposed framework easily obtains segmentation results because the local patches in the model serve as good seeds for the semi-supervised segmentation task. To solve the complexity problem attributable to the large number of patches, the Basin Hopping (BH) sampling method is introduced into the tracking framework. The BH sampling method significantly reduces computational complexity with the help of a deterministic local optimizer.

The application area we consider is that of remote cardiovascular monitoring, where continuous sensing and processing takes place in low-power, computationally constrained devices, thus the power consumption and complexity of the processing algorithms should remain at a minimum level. Under this context, we choose to employ the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the Haar function being the mother wavelet, as our principal analysis method. From the modulus-maxima analysis on the DWT coefficients, an approximation of the ECG fiducial points is extracted. These initial findings are complimented with a refinement stage, based on the time-domain morphological properties of the ECG, which alleviates the decreased temporal resolution of the DWT. The resulting algorithm is a hybrid scheme of time- and frequency-domain signal processing. Feature extraction results from 27 ECG signals from QTDB were tested against manual annotations and used to compare our approach against the state-of-the art ECG delineators. In addition, 450 signals from the 15-lead PTBDB are used to evaluate the obtained performance against the CSE tolerance limits. Our findings indicate that all but one CSE limits are satisfied. This level of performance combined with a complexity analysis, where the upper bound of the proposed algorithm, in terms of arithmetic operations, is calculated as 2.423\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n+214 additions and 1.093\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n+12 multiplications for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n \u2264 861 or 2.553\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n+102 additions and 1.093\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n+10 multiplications for N > 861 (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n being the number of input samples), reveals that the proposed method achieves an ideal tradeoff between computational complexity and performance, a key requirement in remote cardiovascular disease monitoring systems.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2012.2231312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221020/6472751/06420852.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2012.2231312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity ECG Feature Extraction Algorithm for Mobile Healthcare Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity ECG Feature Extraction Algorithm for Mobile Healthcare Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420852/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13785968","pubMedId":"23362250","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420852/","volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity ECG Feature Extraction Algorithm for Mobile Healthcare Applications","sourcePdf":"jbhi-mazomenos-2231312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127217S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6472751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6472751","articleId":"6420852","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6420853,"authors":[{"name":"Tamara Jimenez","affiliation":["University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Tamara Jim\u00e9nez received the Telecommunication Engineer degree from the University of Valladolid, Spain, in 2008, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Optical Communications Group.","Her current research focuses on the design and performance evaluation of optical networks (especially long reach passive optical networks, and cognitive optical networks)."]},"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Jimenez","id":"37950313400"},{"name":"Juan Carlos Aguado","affiliation":["University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Juan Carlos Aguado received the Telecommunication Engineer and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Valladolid, Spain, in 1997 and 2005, respectively.","He has worked as a Junior Lecturer at the University of Valladolid since 1998.

polarization multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying (PM-QPSK) based on multi-modulus blind equalizations (MMBE) is proposed and demonstrated with both simulation and experimental results. The key algorithms for this novel digital signal processing scheme include the cascaded multi-modulus algorithm (CMMA) for blind polarization de-multiplexing, multi-modulus QPSK partitioning frequency offset estimation (FOE) and two stage carrier phase recovery (CPR) with maximum likelihood phase estimation. The final signal is detected by maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) for data BER measurement. It shows that CMMA have better frequency response performance compared with CMA for noise compression. The performances of FOE and CPR are also investigated with different spectrum shaping bandwidth, group size and laser linewidth. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed digital signal processing scheme is demonstrated by the experiment of 112 Gb/s QDB spectrum shaped PM-QPSK signal with a 25 GHz bandwidth waveshaper for Nyquist WDM channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Modulus Blind Equalizations for Coherent Quadrature Duobinary Spectrum Shaped PM-QPSK Digital Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2242429","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6423865/06420856.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2242429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Modulus Blind Equalizations for Coherent Quadrature Duobinary Spectrum Shaped PM-QPSK Digital Signal Processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6420856/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2013","publicationDate":"April1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13287712","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Modulus Blind Equalizations for Coherent Quadrature Duobinary Spectrum Shaped PM-QPSK Digital Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2242429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049854S","chronDate":"April1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6423865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6423865","articleId":"6420856","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420866,"authors":[{"name":"Sean C.

These formulations are completely independent of the material properties of the FDTD computational domain and hence can be applied to truncate arbitrary media without any modification. Moreover, the higher-order PML has the advantages of both the conventional PML and the CFS-PML in terms of absorbing performances. Three numerical simulations have been carried out in three dimensional (3-D) FDTD computational domains to validate these formulations. It is shown in the numerical simulations that the proposed PML formulations with the higher-order scheme are effective in terms of attenuating both the low-frequency propagating waves and evanescent waves and reducing late-time reflections, and also hold comparatively good absorbing performances as compared with the conventional SC-PML and the convolution PML (CPML) with the CFS scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FDTD Implementations of the Higher-Order PML Using DSP Techniques for Arbitrary Media","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2242825","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6511996/06420882.pdf","startPage":"2623","endPage":"2629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2242825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6511996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FDTD Implementations of the Higher-Order PML Using DSP Techniques for Arbitrary Media","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6420882/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13485799","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FDTD Implementations of the Higher-Order PML Using DSP Techniques for Arbitrary Media","sourcePdf":"tap-feng-2242825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111043S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6511996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6511996","articleId":"6420882","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420892,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Qiang He","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6511996/6420892/6420892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guo-Qiang He was born in Shaanxi Province, China, in 1990.

The CMOS X-ray detector employs column-parallel EC-ADCs with a built-in analog binning function for high gray-scale resolution and small silicon area. The total area of the 14.3-bit EC-ADC and digital logic circuits is only 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 1100 \u03bcm. The \u0394\u03a3 modulator in the EC-ADC simultaneously performs the upper 3-bit conversion and the analog binning operation. To reduce the fixed-pattern noise (FPN) from the ADC and the pixel, we adopt the digital correlated-double sampling technique. A bias circuit for the column-parallel readout architecture in a large-area CMOS X-ray detector is proposed to improve the uniformity among column ADCs. Simulation results show that the uniformity of output voltages among column ADCs is improved to 50 times the uniformity in the conventional bias circuit. The proposed CMOS X-ray detector has been fabricated using a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process. The measured differential column FPN and random noise without X-ray exposure at the frame rate of 60 frames/s are 3.10 and 5.17 least significant bit, respectively.

The scaling of the pixel size to increase the spatial resolution is also reducing the barrier separating the photon detection and the collection node in a standard pinned photodiode (PPD). The barrier reduction and the thermionic emission of the electrons allow some of the charges from the photodiode well to feed into the collection node, resulting in a feedforward voltage. In conventional readout of the pixels, this feedforward voltage is neglected and lost when the collection node is reset. The barrier height of the transfer gate (TG) determines the quantity of electrons held back in the photodiode well. Thus, the knowledge of this barrier height is very important in determining the true charge handling capacity of the photodiode potential well. Experiments with standard PPDs showed that a barrier height of around 0.5 V is needed to hold the electrons in the photodiode potential well. This is analogous to the barrier potential for charge-coupled devices reported in the literature. Furthermore, the barrier height dependence on the charge storing time in the photodiode well and the structural dimensions of the TG and photodiode length are also explored in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedforward Effect in Standard CMOS Pinned Photodiodes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2238675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6466448/06420923.pdf","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2238675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward Effect in Standard CMOS Pinned Photodiodes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6420923/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13325941","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward Effect in Standard CMOS Pinned Photodiodes","sourcePdf":"ted-sarkar-2238675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054811S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6466448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6466448","articleId":"6420923","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6420924,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6420924/6420924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei Zhao (S'08) is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA."]},"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37710577900"},{"name":"Randall M.

The current in a SymFET flows by tunneling from an n-type graphene layer to a p-type graphene layer. A large current peak occurs when the Dirac points are aligned at a particular drain-to-source bias \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DS</sub>\n. Our model shows that the current of the SymFET is very weakly dependent on temperature. The resonant current peak is controlled by chemical doping and applied gate bias. The on/off ratio increases with graphene coherence length and doping. The symmetric resonant peak is a good candidate for high-speed analog applications and can enable digital logic similar to the BiSFET. Our analytical model also offers the benefit of permitting simple analysis of features such as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the resonant peak and higher order harmonics of the nonlinear current. The SymFET takes advantage of the perfect symmetry of the band structure of 2-D graphene, a feature that is not present in conventional semiconductors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SymFET: A Proposed Symmetric Graphene Tunneling Field-Effect Transistor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2238238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6466448/06420924.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2238238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466448","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"SymFET: A Proposed Symmetric Graphene Tunneling Field-Effect Transistor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6420924/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13325942","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SymFET: A Proposed Symmetric Graphene Tunneling Field-Effect Transistor","sourcePdf":"ted-zhao-2238238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062777S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6466448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6466448","articleId":"6420924","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6420925,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Shi","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6627992/6420925/6420925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Shi (M\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008.","She has been with the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications since 2008.

In this study, a new method was proposed to identify EM radiated noise sources by using their spatial characteristics as unique parameters for the ANN, which is available even though radiated noise source frequencies overlap. A 3-D receiver array is used to collect the spatial characteristics of radiated noise sources. By training with 60 000 datasets, the network can identify the radiated noise source type within a few minutes with an accuracy as high as 99.98%. The influences on identification accuracy from different parameters, such as ambient noise, interval between neighboring receivers, distance between receiver array and radiated noise sources, moving steps of receiver array, training data number are discussed in detail.

McFIS has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. A neuro-fuzzy inference system forms the cognitive component of the McFIS, and a self-regulatory learning mechanism forms its metacognitive component. The learning ability of the cognitive component is monitored and controlled by the self-regulatory learning mechanism. For each sample in the training dataset, the metacognitive component uses its self-adaptive thresholds to choose one of the following learning strategies based on the criteria that depends on class-specific knowledge: 1) sample deletion; 2) sample learning; and 3) sample reserve. Thus, the metacognitive component decides what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn the training samples. When a new rule is added, the parameters of the new rule are assigned such that the rule has minimum overlapping with the adjacent rules as well as the localization property of the Gaussian rules is efficiently exploited. Performance of the McFIS is evaluated using several well-known benchmark multicategory/binary classification datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository and on a practical human action recognition problem. The results clearly indicate that the proposed metacognitive learning helps the McFIS achieve better performance than other existing classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13934577","volume":"21","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6420927/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Metacognitive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (McFIS) for Sequential Classification Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Metacognitive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (McFIS) for Sequential Classification Problems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-sundaram-2242894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160886S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6675054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6675054","articleId":"6420927","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6420937,"authors":[{"name":"Giampaolo Buticchi","affiliation":["DII-University of Parma, Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6497104/6420937/6420937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giampaolo Buticchi (S'10) was born in Parma, Italy, in 1985.

In this paper, the accuracy of four recently proposed synchrophasor estimators is analyzed and compared with the well-known one-cycle discrete Fourier transform estimator under the effect of static frequency offsets, amplitude modulation, phase modulation, harmonic distortion, and wideband noise. Two of the considered techniques track the phasor variations through finite-difference equations that estimate the first- and second-order derivatives of the phasor itself. The other two methods are instead based on a least squares estimation of the coefficients of the phasor Taylor's series expansion. The analysis reported in this paper covers the main scenarios described in the Standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011. In particular, the influence of different signal parameters on the total vector error (TVE) values is quantified and used to determine the maximum TVE increments associated with distinct parameters and the corresponding upper bounds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2012.2236776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493455","startPage":"963","endPage":"973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6493455/06420940.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchrophasor Estimators Accuracy: A Comparative Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6420940/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synchrophasor Estimators Accuracy: A Comparative Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13412881","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchrophasor Estimators Accuracy: A Comparative Analysis","sourcePdf":"tim-barchi-2236776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081577S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6493455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6493455","articleId":"6420940","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6420986,"authors":[{"name":"Gerald L.

De-jittering received signals is computationally expensive, especially for wideband communications signals, because the induced jitter on received signals varies as a function of RF signal frequency. This paper considers a reconfigurable direct RF receiver (RDRFR) that has a stair-step jitter pattern as a function of RF signal frequency. The RDRFR uses a two-stage sampling circuit. In the first stage, the RF input is bandpass filtered and pulse sampled without quantizing the signal. The discrete-time analog signal is then interpolated with a continuous time low-pass filter, then sampled and quantized by a traditional analog-to-digital converter. With this two-stage sampling circuit, the induced signal jitter from the RF sampling is identical for all in-band signals and is the same to within an integer scale factor for all signals, in-band or out-of-band. This key circuit property means that it is possible to remove jitter with very low computational complexity in the RDRFR. Furthermore, this result can be exploited to improve system performance with non-ideal anti-alias filters by identifying non-desired signals caused by out-of-band leakage.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Radio frequency","Clocks","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","band-pass filters","computational complexity","discrete time filters","interpolation","jitter","low-pass filters","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable direct radiofrequency sampling receiver","RF signal frequency","SNR","dejittering signal receiver","wideband communication signal","RDRFR","stair-step jitter pattern","two-stage sampling circuit","bandpass filtering","pulse sampling","signal quantization","discrete-time analog signal","interpolation","continuous time low-pass filter","analog-to-digital converter","integer scale factor","computational complexity","nonideal antialias filter","nondesired signal identification","out-of-band leakage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct RF sampling","jitter","phase noise","receiver architectures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2226491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6547190/06420986.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2226491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Direct RF Receiver With Jitter Analysis and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Direct RF Receiver With Jitter Analysis and Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420986/","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420986/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13596505","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Direct RF Receiver With Jitter Analysis and Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsi-fudge-2226491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085703S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6547190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6547190","articleId":"6420986","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6420988,"authors":[{"name":"Guanming Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6519344/6420988/6420988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guanming Huang received his B.S. degree at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2008 and M.S. degree in University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, in 2010.

Although the power consumption is largely reduced, this down-scaling trend, however, impacts the stability of the SRAM cell due to the unpredictable process or device parameter variations. In this work, we propose a novel method to evaluate the DRV of SRAM cells at the presence of variations. The DRV issue is first formulated as a time domain worst performance bound problem. To accurately and efficiently evaluate the DRV, a multi-start point (MSP) optimization strategy is then studied and developed with the use of practical circuit simulator. One feature of the proposed method is that it can efficiently evaluate the DRV without suffering from any process/model accuracy. Experiment results show that it achieves a speedup of 3 and 5-7 order over the Importance Sampling (IS) and Monte Carlo (MC) method respectively under the context of the DRV evaluation in this paper. The proposed method can serve as an efficient DRV evaluation tool on any specific technology process or in-house circuit simulator.

The proposed methodology has been applied in the 8-channel integrated recording ASIC dedicated to the broad range of neurobiology experiments. Each of the recording channels is equipped with the control register that enables to set main channel parameters independently. Thanks to this functionality, the user is capable of setting lower cut-off frequency within the range of 300 mHz-900 Hz. The upper cut-off frequency can be switched either to 30 Hz-290 Hz or 9 kHz, while the voltage gain can be set either to 260 V/V or 1000 V/V. A single recording channel is supplied with 1.8 V and consumes only 11 \u03bcW of power, while its input referred noise is equal to 4.4 \u03bcV resulting in NEF equal to 4.1.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6547190/06420990.pdf","startPage":"1764","endPage":"1775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2230504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2230504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Low-Noise Multichannel Neural Amplifier in Submicron CMOS Process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Cutoff frequency","Capacitors","Resistance","Capacitance","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","leakage currents","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","prosthetics","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input referred noise","cortical implant","neurobiology","ASIC","optimal channel dimension","MOS based resistance","leakage current","multielectrode array","silicon area","low power neural recording amplifier","submicron CMOS process","low-noise multichannel neural amplifier","energy efficient neural amplifier","frequency 300 mHz to 900 Hz","voltage 1.8 V","power 11 muW","voltage 4.4 muV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC","multichannel recording system","neurobiology experiments","submicron processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Low-Noise Multichannel Neural Amplifier in Submicron CMOS Process","volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6420990/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13596507","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Low-Noise Multichannel Neural Amplifier in Submicron CMOS Process","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kmon-2230504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095786S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6547190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6547190","articleId":"6420990","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6420991,"authors":[{"name":"Maarten Lont","affiliation":["Stichting IMEC-NL, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maarten","lastName":"Lont","id":"37393302800"},{"name":"Dusan Milosevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Milosevic","id":"37269773900"},{"name":"Guido Dolmans","affiliation":["Stichting IMEC-NL, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dolmans","id":"37268056900"},{"name":"Arthur H.

The wideband FSK receiver supports bit rates up to 625 kbps. To save power, the power consuming phase-locked-loop (PLL) is replaced by an energy efficient digital automatic frequency control (AFC) loop. The AFC acts as a low-bandwidth frequency-locked-loop (FLL), using the FSK demodulator as frequency detector; the measured frequency offset is fed back to the on-chip digitally controlled oscillator. To further decrease the power consumption, the LNA is removed, the passive mixer being the first circuit in the receiver front-end. The mixer-first topology increases the linearity compared to injectionlocked and envelope detector based receivers. Additionally, analytical passive mixer transducer power gain and noise figure models are presented which are used to obtain an optimal mixer-first design.

This paper presents the analysis of a Bang-Bang Phase-Locked Loop Sensor-to-Digital Converter (BBPLL SDC). The highly digital-oriented BBPLL offers advantages such as the low chip area, excellent scalability towards smaller technologies, robustness towards process variations and low-voltage possibilities, making this architecture very interesting for energy-efficient applications. Theoretical analysis of the structure shows that the BBPLL SDC resembles a -modulator with first-order quantization noise shaping due to the frequency-to-phase conversion of the oscillators. Oscillator phase noise however plays an important role in the analysis and limits the SNR in practical implementations. To validate the theoretical analysis, a state-variable-based non-linear Matlab model has been developed, including non-idealities such as phase noise, non-linearity and mismatch. Based on practically achievable phase noise values of state of the art oscillators, simulations show that resolutions up to 110 dB can be achieved. An estimation of the power consumption of the oscillators, based on state of the art figures, results in energy-efficient designs beyond the state of the art with moderate resolutions of 40-80 dB SNR, while high resolutions of 80-110 dB demand higher power consumption in the oscillators, resulting in designs with lower energy efficiency, but still competitive with the current state of the art. A design strategy for both an energy-efficient and a high-performance BBPLL SDC is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6567958/06420992.pdf","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6567958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Energy-Efficient BBPLL-Based Sensor-to-Digital Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6420992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6420992/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Energy-Efficient BBPLL-Based Sensor-to-Digital Converters","volume":"60","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13786044","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6420992/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Energy-Efficient BBPLL-Based Sensor-to-Digital Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-vanrethy-2239097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101328S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6567958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6567958","articleId":"6420992","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6420993,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6519344/6420993/6420993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chua-Chin Wang (M'9\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from SUNY (State University of New York) at Stony Brook, NY, USA, in 1992.","He then joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan, and became a full Professor in 1998.

WBANs constitute a new class of wireless sensor networks that enable diverse applications in healthcare, entertainment, sports, military and emergency situations. A typical WBAN consists of a few, heterogeneous sensors wirelessly coupled to an energy-constrained fusion center which, according to observations of a real-world prototype WBAN, imposes critical restrictions on system lifetime. To address this issue, a novel stochastic control framework is introduced, which considers both sensor heterogeneity and application requirements, for achieving the two-fold goal: energy savings with satisfactory detection performance. An optimal dynamic programming algorithm for the sensor selection problem is also derived. Important properties of the cost functionals are derived and used to design three approximation algorithms, which offer near optimal performance with significant complexity reduction. Simulations on real-world data show energy gains as high as 68% in comparison to an equal allocation scheme with probability of detection error on the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6476733/06421005.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2236320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2236320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6476733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient, Heterogeneous Sensor Selection for Physical Activity Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Approximation methods","Heuristic algorithms","Energy consumption","Accuracy","Prototypes","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","body sensor networks","dynamic programming","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient heterogeneous sensor selection","physical activity detection","wireless body area networks","energy-constrained heterogeneous WBAN","healthcare","entertainment","sports","military","emergency situation","energy-constrained fusion center","real-world prototype WBAN","system lifetime","stochastic control framework","sensor heterogeneity","optimal dynamic programming algorithm","sensor selection problem","cost functionals","allocation scheme","detection error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","body sensor networks","controlled sensing","dynamic sensor selection","energy-efficient tracking","heterogeneous resource management","partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP)","physical activity detection","stochastic dynamic programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient, Heterogeneous Sensor Selection for Physical Activity Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks","volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6421005/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13357523","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient, Heterogeneous Sensor Selection for Physical Activity Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-zois-2236320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190172S","chronDate":"April1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6476733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6476733","articleId":"6421005","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421008,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay N.

The nonplanar nature of multigate devices, along with rapidly shrinking front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) features, has compounded the problem of parasitics extraction in future technology nodes. In this paper, for the first time, we address the above problem through a holistic 3-D-technology CAD (3-D-TCAD) flow for the extraction of FEOL/(FEOL+BEOL) capacitances in generic multigate circuit layouts, using a transport analysis-based approach. We investigate device-level parasitic capacitances in 3-D-process-simulated bulk and silicon-on-insulator FinFETs, and uncover capacitance scaling trends for candidate single/multifin multigate FETs along the 22-nm/14-nm/10-nm technology nodes. Leveraging automated structure synthesis algorithms, we synthesize 3-D multigate 6T SRAM structures using the process-simulated devices, and examine the effects of fin pitch, gate pitch, and fin count on circuit-level parasitics. Thereafter, we show that traditional segregated FEOL/BEOL modeling approaches fail to provide accurate estimates, by back-annotating 3-D-TCAD-extracted capacitances into mixed-mode write simulations of a 6T FinFET SRAM bitcell. Finally, using FinFET NAND2 logic gate delay simulations, we establish the fact that capturing parasitics accurately is as important as modeling device transport accurately, and that performance/dynamic behavior in multigate circuits is highly sensitive to both factors.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2227848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6606858/06421008.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2227848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D-TCAD-Based Parasitic Capacitance Extraction for Emerging Multigate Devices and Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421008/","displayDocTitle":"3-D-TCAD-Based Parasitic Capacitance Extraction for Emerging Multigate Devices and Circuits","volume":"21","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795460","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421008/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D-TCAD-Based Parasitic Capacitance Extraction for Emerging Multigate Devices and Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bhoj-2227848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214203S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6606858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6606858","articleId":"6421008","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421017,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Dartmann","affiliation":["Chair for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6421017/6421017-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guido Dartmann (S\u201911) received the Diploma in computer engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University.","He is also a Research Assistant with the Chair for Integrated Signal Processing Systems.

A fair distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is desirable. A well-known technique to get a fair (balanced) SINR is max-min unicast beamforming (MBF). However, in a multicell network, there are conditions where MBF can result in a low balanced SINR. This happens if, e.g., two users are geographically close together and served by two base stations (BSs) from, e.g., two different interfering sectors. Then, the mutual interference among the two links will be large, and the balanced SINR among all jointly optimized links decreases. Therefore, the users must be scheduled such that these situations are avoided. In this paper, smart selection of active beams to avoid intercell interference is called beam scheduling and leads to a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes a graph-theory-based problem that is closely related to the beam scheduling problem. The proposed algorithms maximize the sum rate or the minimum SINR among all users and slots. For the two-cell case, an optimal algorithm exists. In the N > 2-cell case, the beam scheduling problem is proven to be NP-hard. Based on the close relation between the beam scheduling problem and the multidimensional assignment problem (MAP), this paper presents suboptimal algorithms for N > 2 to maximize either the sum rate or the minimum SINR among all users and slots. The performance gain in terms of the mean sum rate or the minimum SINR is significant compared with random scheduling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6421017/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487057","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Graph Theory to the Multicell Beam Scheduling Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Graph Theory to the Multicell Beam Scheduling Problem","sourcePdf":"tvt-dartmann-2242912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151783S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6421017","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6421032,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Chang Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6521375/6421032/6421032-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jui-Chang Kuo received the B.S. degree in civil engineering and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

The notch band from 5.0-6.3 GHz is realized by embedding arc-shaped slot resonators on the feeding structures. The proposed antenna facilitates nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern, low envelope correction coefficient, moderate gain, and efficiency.

We first derive a kinematic constraint for the \u201ceffective shape\u201d of the human ankle-foot complex during locomotion. This shape characterizes ankle motion as a function of the center of pressure (COP)-the point on the foot sole where the resultant ground reaction force is imparted. Since the COP moves monotonically from heel to toe during steady walking, we adopt the COP as a mechanical representation of the gait cycle phase in an autonomous feedback controller. We show that our kinematic constraint can be enforced as a virtual constraint by an output linearizing controller that uses only feedback available to sensors onboard a prosthetic leg. Using simulations of a passive walking model with feet, we show that this novel controller enforces exactly the desired effective shape, whereas a standard impedance (i.e., proportional-derivative) controller cannot. This brief provides a single, biomimetic control law for the entire single-support period during robot-assisted locomotion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Biomimetic Virtual Constraint Control of a Powered Prosthetic Leg","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2012.2236840","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/6687265/06421036.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2012.2236840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Towards Biomimetic Virtual Constraint Control of a Powered Prosthetic Leg","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6421036/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13989836","pubMedId":"25552894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Biomimetic Virtual Constraint Control of a Powered Prosthetic Leg","sourcePdf":"tcst-gregg-2236840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090005S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6687265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6687265","articleId":"6421036","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6421039,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Varnavas","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, KingsHealth Partners, Saint Thomas Hospital, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Varnavas","id":"37541426900"},{"name":"Tom Carrell","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, KingsHealth Partners, Saint Thomas Hospital, King's College London, London, UK","Department of Vascular Surgery, Guys and Saint Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, Kings Health Partners, London, UK"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Carrell","id":"38547498800"},{"name":"Graeme Penney","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, KingsHealth Partners, Saint Thomas Hospital, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Penney","id":"37268707100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"6421039","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":960},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the Automation of a 2D-3D Registration System","abstract":"Routine clinical use of 2D-3D registration algorithms for Image Guided Surgery remains limited. A key aspect for routine clinical use of this technology is its degree of automation, i.e., the amount of necessary knowledgeable interaction between the clinicians and the registration system. Current image-based registration approaches usually require knowledgeable manual interaction during two stages: for initial pose estimation and for verification of produced results. We propose four novel techniques, particularly suited to vertebra-based registration systems, which can significantly automate both of the above stages. Two of these techniques are based upon the intraoperative \u201cinsertion\u201d of a virtual fiducial marker into the preoperative data. The remaining two techniques use the final registration similarity value between multiple CT vertebrae and a single fluoroscopy vertebra. The proposed methods were evaluated with data from 31 operations (31 CT scans, 419 fluoroscopy images). Results show these methods can remove the need for manual vertebra identification during initial pose estimation, and were also very effective for result verification, producing a combined true positive rate of 100% and false positive rate equal to zero. This large decrease in required knowledgeable interaction is an important contribution aiming to enable more widespread use of 2D-3D registration technology.","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6423975/06421039.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2227337","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2012.2227337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421039","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Surgery","Estimation","Accuracy","Automation","Tracking","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","image registration","medical image processing","orthopaedics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automation","registration verification","2D-3D registration","clinical use","registration algorithms","image guided surgery","registration approaches","pose estimation","intraoperative insertion","virtual fiducial marker","preoperative data","CT vertebrae","fluoroscopy vertebra","vertebra identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image guided surgery","registration verification","2D-3D registration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Surgery, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the Automation of a 2D-3D Registration System","accessionNumber":"13287702","pubMedId":"23362246","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6421039/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the Automation of a 2D-3D Registration System","sourcePdf":"tmi-varnavas-2227337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063235S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6423975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6423975","articleId":"6421039","onlineDate":"25 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6421040,"authors":[{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6462010/6421040/6421040-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunong Zhang (S'02-M'03) received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the M.S. degree from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 1996, 1999, and 2003, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, where he has been since 2006.

Hence, it has attracted research attention in recent years. The redundancy inherent in the uncompressed video signals may be exploited by joint source-channel decoding to improve the attainable error resilience. Hence, in this treatise, we study the application of iterative joint source-channel decoding aided uncompressed video transmission, where correlation inherent in the video signals is modeled by a first-order Markov process. First, we propose a spatiotemporal joint source-channel decoding system using a recursive systematic convolutional codec, where both the horizontal and vertical intraframe correlations, as well as the interframe correlations, are exploited by the receiver, hence relying on 3-D information exchange. This scheme may be combined with arbitrary channel codecs. Then, we analyze the three-stage decoder's convergence behavior using 3-D extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Finally, we benchmark the attainable system performance against a couple of video communication systems, including our previously proposed 2-D scheme, where only intraframe correlations were exploited without invoking a channel codec.

The layout of on-chip antennas is dictated by foundry specific rules whereas characterization of on-chip antennas requires special text fixtures. For future highly integrated SoC solutions, foundries will have to provide special layers for efficient on-chip antenna implementations, as they currently do for on-chip inductors.

In a typical transceiver, most of the power is dissipated in the power amplifier (PA) and consequently, it is very important to obtain the maximum efficiency from the PA. A PA operating in Class AB or B is at its maximum efficiency when it is driven by its maximum allowable input power [1]. In practice, the input signal of the PA usually has a varying envelope, and to avoid distortion the PA should not be driven to more than its maximum input saturating power. Unfortunately, this peak power of the input signal happens at very short periods, and most of the time the signal power is around its average power, which is much smaller than its peak power, meaning that, often, the PA works at much lower efficiencies than its maximum efficiency. The power difference is defined as the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal. For example, for a signal with 12 dB PAPR, a Class B PA would be driven with 12 dB power back-off from its peak input power, and at this power back-off, the efficiency of the PA will degrade from 78.5% to around 20% [1]. Unfortunately, by moving to high throughput modulation schemes, for example, quadrature amplitude modulations (QAMs) such as 16-QAM and 64-QAM mean that more envelope variation is needed to encode the information, and, consequently, lower efficiency is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2012.2226541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/6421043/06421086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2012.2226541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421043","startPage":"68","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delta-sigma-based transmitters: Advantages and disadvantages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delta-sigma-based transmitters: Advantages and disadvantages","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13251842","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6421086/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delta-sigma-based transmitters: Advantages and disadvantages","sourcePdf":"14mmm01-ebrahimi-2226541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079969S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"6421043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6421043","articleId":"6421086","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6421089,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Musolff","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Musolff","id":"37657970500"},{"name":"Michael Kamper","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kamper","id":"38235532900"},{"name":"Zeid Abou-Chahine","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks GmbH & Co.

Our entire RF infrastructure ecosystem, from communication system networks, to satellite systems, to wideband spectral analysis, to instrumentation and radar systems, uses a variety of switches for signal routing and control (attenuation, phase shifting, etc.). The ideal switch was achieved long time ago using electromechanical relays, and even after nearly 100 years, it is still the best RF switch ever made from an electrical perspective [1]. It has very low insertion loss (Ron <;1 \u03a9), very high isolation (Coff of few fF), very high linearity and high power handling (100 mW to 50 W).

This algorithm has been tested on remote sensing images and compared with other methods, the result shows that the approach presented here generates a considerably high detection rate and low false alarm rate in a reasonable time.","doi":"10.1109/CVRS.2012.6421236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVRS.2012.6421236","startPage":"72","endPage":"77","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Vision in Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410226/6421218/06421236.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Computer Vision in Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Airport detection based on Line Segment Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Airport detection based on Line Segment Detector","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421236/","accessionNumber":"13355948","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421236/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airport detection based on Line Segment Detector","confLoc":"Xiamen","sourcePdf":"1234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089276S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410226","isNumber":"6421218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410226","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6421218","articleId":"6421236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6421242,"authors":[{"name":"Aixia Li","affiliation":["College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Aixia Li","id":"38547793700"},{"name":"Zequn Guan","affiliation":["College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zequn Guan","id":"37069468600"},{"name":"Haiyan Guan","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Haiyan Guan","id":"38547318900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1274-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1272-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1273-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6421242","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421242","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Geology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image registration","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multioverlapped based global registration","UAV image registration","unmanned aerial vehicle","multiimage matching","manifold learning algorithm","globally mosaic image coordinate system","global image registration parameter","frame-to-frame registration method","error accumulation","registration accuracy","image mosaic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV images","manifold learning","multi-image matching","global registration"]}],"abstract":"A new global registration method based on multi-image matching is proposed for image mosaic.

Modeling experiments are carried out over the L-band polarimetric SAR images acquired by JPL/AIRSAR and a VV-polarized C-band TerraSAR-X SAR image.

With digital explosion, image collections in databases in distributed locations over the Internet pose a challenge to retrieve images that are relevant to user queries efficiently and accurately. It becomes increasingly important to develop new CBIR techniques that are effective and scalable for real-time processing of very large image collections. To address this, the paper proposes a novel MapReduce neural network framework for CBIR from large data collection in a cloud environment. We adopt natural language queries that use a fuzzy approach to classify the colour images based on their content and apply Map and Reduce functions that can operate in cloud clusters for arriving at accurate results in real-time. Preliminary experimental results for classifying and retrieving images from large data sets were quite convincing to carry out further experimental evaluations.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2012.6421310","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409521/6421298/06421310.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2012.6421310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MapReduce neural network framework for efficient content based image retrieval from large datasets in the cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MapReduce neural network framework for efficient content based image retrieval from large datasets in the cloud","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13270153","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6421310/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MapReduce neural network framework for efficient content based image retrieval from large datasets in the cloud","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"RP12035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095305S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6421316,"authors":[{"name":"Abdalla Zidan","affiliation":["Institute of Statistical Studies and Researches, Cairo University, Egypt","Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE)"],"firstName":"Abdalla","lastName":"Zidan","id":"38547749600"},{"name":"Neveen I.

Features of first order statistics and grey-level cooccurrence matrix, are calculated and passed to an artificial neural network, to be trained and to classify infected regions. Filtering is used before the segmentation approach to enhance contrast, remove noise and emphasize certain features, as well as connecting ribs around the liver. To evaluate the performance of presented approach, we performed many tests on different CT liver images.

K-clustering can be categorized as semi-supervised learning where K is known. Here we have considered K-Clustering with simultaneous feature selection. Feature subset selection helps to identify relevant features for clustering, increase understandability, better scalability and improve accuracy. Here we have used two measures, intra-cluster distance (Homogeneity, H) and inter-cluster distances (Separation, S) for clustering. Measures are using mod distance per feature suitable for categorical features (attributes). Rather than combining H and S to frame the problem as single objective optimization problem, we use multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to find out diverse solutions near to Pareto optimal front in the two-dimensional objective space. Each evolved solution represents a set of cluster modes (CMs) build by selected feature subset. Here, K-modes is hybridized with MOGA. We have used hybridized GA to combine global searching powers of GA with local searching powers of K-modes. Considering context sensitivity, we have used a special crossover operator called \u201cpairwise crossover\u201d and \u201csubstitution\u201d. The main contribution of this paper is simultaneous dimensionality reduction and optimization of objectives using MOGA.

The searching power of Genetic Algorithm (GA) is exploited to search for suitable clusters and cluster centroids (means or modes) so that intra-cluster distance (Homogeneity, H) and inter-cluster distances (Separation, S) are simultaneously optimized. It is achieved by measuring H and S using a special distance per feature metric, suitable for continuous and categorical features both.

Extracted information are given in the form of class labels and data distribution during clustering process. In this paper the problem of semi-supervised clustering is formulated under the framework of multiobjective optimization (MOO). Thereafter, a multiobjective based clustering technique is extended to solve the semi-supervised clustering problem. The newly developed semi-supervised multiobjective clustering algorithm (Semi-GenClustMOO), is used for appropriate partitioning of data into appropriate number of clusters. Four objective functions are optimized, out of which first three use some unsupervised information and the last one uses supervised information. These four objective functions represent, respectively, the, total compactness of the partitioning, total symmetry present in the clusters, cluster connectedness and Adjust Rand Index. These four objective functions are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA, a newly developed simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization method. Results show that it can easily detect the appropriate number of clusters as well as the appropriate partitioning from data sets having either well-separated clusters of any shape or symmetrical clusters with or without overlaps. Seven artificial and four real-life data sets have been used for evaluation to show the effectiveness of the Semi-GenClustMOO technique.

Traditional influence scoring algorithms rely only on the number of direct connections of a user or on a ratio of their connections. As proved by recent research, a focus solely on the connection between users skews an understanding of how influence operates and follows. In this paper we differentiate between passive and active information. Information is classified as active if it promotes engagement through conversation and is thus exposed to more members, increasing the reach of information. Using a large amount of social network data we analyze the different components of information generated by a user, its propagation within the network and derive a metric for calculating the user's influence score. This influence score considers both the passive content and the active conversation aspect of the shared information. The score relies on the network metric degree of centrality. The measure of inbound and outbound information for 2 levels in the network, provide insight to the amplification of the reach of the shared information.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2012.6421367","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409521/6421298/06421367.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2012.6421367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring influence in social networks using a network amplification score - an analysis using cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421367/","displayDocTitle":"Measuring influence in social networks using a network amplification score - an analysis using cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270210","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421367/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring influence in social networks using a network amplification score - an analysis using cloud computing","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"RP69194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119729S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6421368,"authors":[{"name":"Avni Shah","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, MIT College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Avni","lastName":"Shah","id":"37086717898"},{"name":"Sunil.B.

Secondly we will preprocess the ECG data by using a method of statistical. Thirdly we can use the neural network algorithm to train the data, and then classify different people's data into a different class. Finally when there are one new ECG data, we can also use neural network to identify the new data. Even one people have several ECG signal, with our approach, the ECG identification is feasible.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2012.6421372","startPage":"427","endPage":"430","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409521/6421298/06421372.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2012.6421372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new ECG identification with neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Databases","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","medical signal processing","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG identification","Electrocardiogram","body state","statistical method","neural network algorithm","ECG signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG","human identification","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new ECG identification with neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421372/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270215","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new ECG identification with neural network","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"RP74202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06046S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6421376,"authors":[{"name":"Sudarshan Nandy","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Technological Studies, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Sudarshan","lastName":"Nandy","id":"37088506953"},{"name":"Partha Pratim Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, JIS college of Engineering, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Partha Pratim","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37333790500"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Technological Studies, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"},{"name":"Manoj Karmakar","affiliation":["Department of Eletronics & Tele.

The Firefly algorithm is one of the nature inspired solution. The objective of the proposed work is of two folds. In the first fold the firefly algorithm is applied to the back-propagation training phase to optimize the overall training process. One of the problem in this type of implementation is the adjustment of algorithmic parameters and number of firefly population, and for a dynamic system the manual modification of parameter is a troublesome matter. In the second fold, the proposed work is implemented a statistical hypothesis based agent which is adaptively control the various parameters and number of firefly populations in firefly algorithm based back-propagation method and this makes it more convenient for dynamic systems. The effectiveness of automatic parameter adjustment over the performance of algorithm is analyzed through correct classification rate and sum of squared error. The proposed method is tested over five bench mark non-linear standard data set and it is compared with genetic algorithm based back-propagation method. It is observed from the experiment that the agent automatically adjust the parameters and number of firefly populations in each iteration of the back-propagation optimization phase and it is finally converged within a minimum number of iteration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421376/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13270219","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421376/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Agent based adaptive firefly back-propagation neural network training method for dynamic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agent based adaptive firefly back-propagation neural network training method for dynamic systems","confLoc":"Pune","sourcePdf":"RP78210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073615S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6421384,"authors":[{"name":"Nesrine TALBI","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, Faculty of science and Technology, Jijel University, Jijel, Algeria"],"firstName":"Nesrine","lastName":"TALBI","id":"37713577800"},{"name":"Khaled BELARBI","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, Faculty of Engineering, Mentoury University, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"BELARBI","id":"37713566700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5116-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5114-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5115-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6421384","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid intelligent systems","Decision support systems","Field-flow fractionation","Algorithm design and analysis","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","fuzzy systems","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced fuzzy rule base design","hybrid elite genetic algorithm","metaheuristic algorithm","evolutionary algorithm","optimal fuzzy system design","HEGATS learning algorithm","reduced knowledge base generation","tabu search algorithm","best neighbor solution","GA convergence","dynamic membership function adjustment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tabu Search","Elitism","Genetic Algorithm","Fuzzy Controller","fuzzy modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421384","abstract":"In this paper, Metaheuristic and Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used for optimal design of fuzzy systems.

Many techniques have been developed to analyze time series and understand the system that produces them. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to improve the accuracy of time series classifiers by using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The proposed approach is based on the principle of learning by mistakes. A HMM model is trained using the confusion matrices which are normally used to measure the classification accuracy. Misclassified samples are the basis of learning process. Our approach improves the classification accuracy by executing a second cycle of classification taking into account the temporal relations in the data. The objective of the proposed approach is to utilize the strengths of Hidden Markov Models (dealing with temporal data) to complement the weaknesses of other classification techniques. Consequently, instead of finding single isolated patterns, we focus on understanding the relationships between these patterns. The proposed approach was evaluated with a case study. The target of the case study was to classify real drilling data generated by rig sensors. Experimental evaluation proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving time series classification using Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2012.6421385","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409521/6421298/06421385.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2012.6421385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving time series classification using Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421385/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270228","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving time series classification using Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"RP87227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056584S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6421389,"authors":[{"name":"Pravin R.

algorithm based on immunity (GABI) on the basis of parallel genetic algorithms (PGA) is proposed in order to overcome some defects of them, such as premature and slow convergence rate. The global performance of the algorithm is improved by introducing immunity theory into PGA. This is revealed in the following two aspects. One is that the immune selection based on proposed adjustable geometric-progression rank-based selection can prevent the algorithm from premature. The other is that convergence rate can be accelerate by individual migration strategy between subpopulations based on immune memory mechanism. In this algorithm, the idea of multiple subpopulations evolution based on improved adaptive crossover and mutation is adopted. To be hybridized with the Powell method can further improve local searching performance of the algorithm. An example of layout design shows that GABI is feasible and effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421396/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270239","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel genetic algorithm based on immunity and its application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel genetic algorithm based on immunity and its application","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"RP98303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07158S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409521","isNumber":"6421298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6421298","articleId":"6421396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6421427,"authors":[{"name":"Saied M.

In this work, we propose an analytical model for mobile user connectivity probability in Femto-Macro cellular networks. On the other hand, we study the capability of femtocell networks to serve macro users (MUEs) at the boundary of macrocell i.e., no coverage or poor signal as well as to serve the users fully inside the femtocell i.e., reduce the communication load of macrocell. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of computing the connectivity probability in Femto-Macro cellular networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile user connectivity performance with coexisting femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2012.6421427","displayPublicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410664/6421421/06421427.pdf","startPage":"016","endPage":"020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2012.6421427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mobile user connectivity performance with coexisting femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421427/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile user connectivity performance with coexisting femtocell networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088755S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410664","isNumber":"6421421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410664","xplore-issue":"6421421","articleId":"6421427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421434,"authors":[{"name":"Nassib Laouini","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Tarbes, Tarbes, Midi-Pyr\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9es, FR"],"firstName":"Nassib","lastName":"Laouini","id":"37087171348"},{"name":"Larbi Ben Hadj Slama","affiliation":["INNOVCOM Laboratory, SUPCOM, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Larbi","lastName":"Ben Hadj Slama","id":"37400737000"},{"name":"Ammar Bouallegue","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Tarbes, Tarbes, Midi-Pyr\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9es, FR"],"firstName":"Ammar","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37285012400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2890-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2891-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2889-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-4092"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-4106"}],"articleNumber":"6421434","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421434","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","iterative methods","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check code decoding","iteration","layered belief propagation decoding","variable node layering","check node layering","bit error rate","BER"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421421","displayPublicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","publicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2012.6421434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast decoding of low density parity check codes","startPage":"052","endPage":"056","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410664/6421421/06421434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2012.6421434","abstract":"The Layered Belief Propagation L-BP algorithm is is a modified Belief Propagation BP algorithm, where the check nodes are divided in subgroups called layers and each iteration is broken into multiple sub-iterations.

OCDMA-PON can potentially provide all customers with a Gb/s-cIass bandwidth upstream with inherent flexibility. Unfortunately OCDMA suffers from Multiple Access Interference (MAl) and various detection noises. To mitigate MAl we propose a novel parallel interference cancellation technique for incoherent DS-OCDMA that better exploits the positivity of the solution. The proposed PIC scheme incorporates this additional information into its structure. The proposed PIC detector is shown to outperform the conventional correlator detector, the decorrelator detector, the Linear Parallel Interference Cancellation (LPIC) detector and even the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) detector. As a matter of fact, our detector achieves more than 1 dB enhancement in SNR at 10.3 average BER for 32 active users compared to the LMMSE detector. This gain can be used to reduce the code length required to support a higher number of users.","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2012.6421466","publicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410664/6421421/06421466.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2012.6421466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projected parallel interference cancellation multiuser detector for asynchronous upstream OCDMA-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421466/","displayDocTitle":"Projected parallel interference cancellation multiuser detector for asynchronous upstream OCDMA-PON","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421466/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projected parallel interference cancellation multiuser detector for asynchronous upstream OCDMA-PON","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093493S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410664","isNumber":"6421421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410664","xplore-issue":"6421421","articleId":"6421466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421467,"authors":[{"name":"O.

These techniques highly contribute to the improvement of system spectral efficiency. Blind equalizers have recently been used to compensate for linear fiber impairments. In this paper we apply the inverse QR decomposition (IQRD), algorithm for blind equalization in 14Gbaud-16QAM coherent receiver. IQRD is widely used in wireless communications and known for its inherent stability in finite precision environment. We compare its performance with the standard Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm in terms of convergence rate (CR) and bit error rate (BER). Our simulation results show that IQRD algorithm achieves similar CR and BER performance as those of standard RLS algorithm. However, in finite precision environment, which is more appropriate for practical implementation, and results in lower system power consumption (human friendly or Green solution), IQRD completely outperforms the RLS technique. A substantial reduction in BER of two orders of magnitude at 14 bit resolution is achieved for the optical system under consideration.","doi":"10.1109/HONET.2012.6421468","publicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"High Capacity Optical Networks and Emerging/Enabling Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410664/6421421/06421468.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HONET.2012.6421468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse QR decomposition (IQRD) blind equalizer for QAM coherent optical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421468/","displayDocTitle":"Inverse QR decomposition (IQRD) blind equalizer for QAM coherent optical systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13356050","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421468/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse QR decomposition (IQRD) blind equalizer for QAM coherent optical systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"paper42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051074S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410664","isNumber":"6421421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410664","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6421421","articleId":"6421468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421469,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Ragheb","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Prince Sultan Advanced Technologies Research Institute (PSATRI), King Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Ragheb","id":"38237989500"},{"name":"Habib Fathallah","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, KACST-Technology Innovation Center in Radio Frequency and Photonics (RFTONICS), King Saud University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Fathallah","id":"37372974600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2890-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2891-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2889-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-4092"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-4106"}],"articleNumber":"6421469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421469","abstract":"Various approaches have been developed for next generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs) in order to achieve higher data rates, larger counts of wavelength channels, and longer fiber ranges.

For experimental demonstration, the simulated and measured results of a 2.4 GHz antenna array fabricated on low-cost printed circuit board are given.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","startPage":"58","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421497.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-profile, compact, mode-decomposition based antenna array for use in beam-forming application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6421497/","displayDocTitle":"A low-profile, compact, mode-decomposition based antenna array for use in beam-forming application","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13269713","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-profile, compact, mode-decomposition based antenna array for use in beam-forming application","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"2A501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040639S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6421509,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Zijie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Zijie","id":"38233960000"},{"name":"Koen Mouthaan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Mouthaan","id":"37295313100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421509","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","CMOS integrated circuits","Phase shifters","Voltage control","Transistors","Transconductance","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","multiplying circuits","phase shifters","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector-sum phase shifter","wideband CMOS variable gain amplifier","VGA","continous linear-in-magnitude gain control curve","programmable transconductance multiplier","wideband input matching","common-gate configuration","gain flatness","output matching","three-stage Cherry-Hooper amplifier","inductive peaking","CMOS process","linear-in-magnitude gain tuning range","transmission phase error","frequency 2 GHz to 6.5 GHz","size 0.13 mum","voltage 1.2 V","power 6 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vector-sum phase shifters","linear-in-magnitude","CMOS wideband variable gain amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421509","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421509.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2\u20136.5 GHz CMOS variable gain amplifier for vector-sum phase shifters","abstract":"A wideband CMOS variable gain amplifier (VGA) for application in vector-sum phase shifters is presented.

International standards for different application scenarios, such as IEEE 802.11ad et cetera, have been released. In China, the millimeter wave frequency band of 59-64 GHz has also been assigned for developing the Chinese 60GHz wireless communication systems. In 2010, a new millimeter wave wireless communication standard was proposed by the authors and named as Q-LINKPAN, in which Q means Q-band, LINKPAN means it can support both point-to-point high data rate communication (Q-LINKPAN-L) and short range high speed wireless access (Q-LINKPAN-S). In September, 2012, it was included in IEEE802.11aj (45GHz).

However, WPAN requires high gain wide coverage area phased array antenna (PAA) for practical uses. In measurement of PAA, 3-D radiation pattern measurement is preferred. However, 2-D measurement is usually used because of limitations of measurement system. In this work, we propose a measurement method that can reduce measurement time for PAA while providing all radiation patterns; and a fixture to measure the 3-D radiation pattern which is compact and provides low interference on antenna's radiation pattern.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421525/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13269741","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421525/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 3-D radiation pattern measurement method for a 60-GHz-band WPAN phased array antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3-D radiation pattern measurement method for a 60-GHz-band WPAN phased array antenna","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"2C402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083108S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421541,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Zhong","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Zhong","id":"38547215600"},{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37537285500"},{"name":"Mao Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Mao Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539561300"},{"name":"Gui Ping Li","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Gui Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"37405542000"},{"name":"Xiao Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38489267700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421541","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421541","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Waveguide transitions","Finline","Frequency measurement","MMICs","Electromagnetic waveguides","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave integrated circuits","microwave power amplifiers","power combiners","rectangular waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band power amplifier","low loss rectangular waveguide-to-microstrip finline transition","waveguide structure","planar circuits","monolithic microwave integrated circuit","insertion loss","DC voltage-stabilizing power supply circuit","bias circuit","power combiner","frequency 92 GHz to 96 GHz","loss 2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["W-band","power amplifier","finline transition","bias circuit"]}],"abstract":"A 92-96 GHz W-Band power amplifier is designed and analyzed in this paper.

This topology enables the enhancement of amplifier bandwidth and achieves a more compact amplifier size. In order to remove an inverting network, the output matching network of the carrier amplifier is designed to realize high performance both at a low-RF level in the off-state of a peaking amplifier and at the RF saturation level. A 1.9-GHz Doherty amplifier without a quarter-wave impedance inverting network was designed and fabricated using GaN HEMTs.

Because coupling between two TEM-modes is too strong to design an appropriate pass bandwidth, triple-mode resonator is analyzed for this time. By EM field simulation, the resonance modes are identified and three resonance frequencies are coincided at 2GHz by tuning the cavity structure. Further, adjustment methods for resonance frequencies, inter-resonator couplings, and input/output couplings are investigated to form a three-pole pseudo-Elliptic-function BPF. Then, an experimental triple-mode filter is fabricated. The measured performance shows very excellent performance with high selectivity owing to the attenuation poles at both sides of the pass-band.

One of the most significant figures of merit concerning PA linearity is its adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR). The aim of this paper is to propose a time-efficient simulation procedure for ACPR which conforms with the latest 3GPP TS 25.101 specifications for its calculation. This procedure overcomes the time penalty associated with the traditional envelope-based simulation method. The approach is based on standard harmonic balance (HB) tools with MATLAB post-processing incorporating the Overlap-add (OLA) signal decomposition DSP technique for fast RRC filtering. In addition, the simulation results are compared with measurements of a commercial WCDMA PA for verification. Accuracies of better than 0.5dB and 1.1dB are achieved up to 10dB and 2dB backoff respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421641","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421641.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"495","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-efficient adjacent channel power ratio simulation utilizing Overlap-add signal decomposition for UMTS power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Time-efficient adjacent channel power ratio simulation utilizing Overlap-add signal decomposition for UMTS power amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6421641/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13269857","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421641/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-efficient adjacent channel power ratio simulation utilizing Overlap-add signal decomposition for UMTS power amplifiers","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3B111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050512S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6421642,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunwook Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunwook","lastName":"Hwang","id":"38547788000"},{"name":"Seungin Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537752100"},{"name":"Chulhun Seo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chulhun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37331804400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421642","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1065},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Detectors","Logic gates","Voltage control","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high PAE power amplifier","adaptive bias control circuit","resonant WPT system","high efficiency power amplifier","wireless power transmission","class E amplifier structure","directional coupler","power detector","operation amplifier","high gain amplifier","drive amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High efficiency","high gain","wireless power transmission","adaptive bias control","power amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421642","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421642.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High gain and high PAE power amplifier by employing adaptive bias control circuit for resonant WPT","abstract":"In this paper, high-efficiency power amplifier is implemented using adaptive bias control circuit for the wireless power transmission (WPT).

They greatly simplify the design procedure, avoiding trial-and-error or one-factor-at-a-time approaches. The first methodology is based on design of experiments (DOE) for size optimization. DOE generates response surface models, which are polynomial functions of the associated geometric parameters, and they can be used for predicting the performance of antennas. The second methodology is based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for topology optimization. By dividing the metal patch of a planar square monopole antenna into one hundred small square pixels, which can be filled with either metal or air, the corresponding metal/air state of each square pixel is determined by BPSO. A pixelized antenna whose performance meets the design needs is thus obtained.

The initial-on PMOS improves the turn-on speed and the inductor resonates with the parasitic capacitance, respectively. Also, a 3-stage wideband V-band LNA is designed by using the gate inductor in the common-gate stage of the cascode topology as gain peaking to compensate the roll-off at high frequencies for bandwidth extension.

This model takes advantage of the fading property of memory effects and separately adjusts the nonlinearity order in each of the memory polynomial branches. An efficient algorithm is reported to successively identify the nonlinearity order required in each of the model branches. Experimental validation carried on a 3G Doherty power amplifier prototype driven by two multi-carrier WCDMA signals shows that the proposed model reduces the required number of coefficients by at least 30% while maintaining the modeling accuracy. This complexity reduction is highly desired in emerging applications where the operating conditions change rapidly and thus requires fast adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421751","startPage":"836","endPage":"838","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421751.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform memory polynomial behavioral model for wireless transmitters and power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform memory polynomial behavioral model for wireless transmitters and power amplifiers","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421751/","accessionNumber":"13269967","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421751/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform memory polynomial behavioral model for wireless transmitters and power amplifiers","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4A103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040712S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6421774,"authors":[{"name":"Goh Fukuda","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Goh","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"38247451100"},{"name":"Satoshi Yoshida","affiliation":["Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan AeroSpace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37531137100"},{"name":"Yuta Kobayashi","affiliation":["Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan AeroSpace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"38240100700"},{"name":"Takumasa Noji","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumasa","lastName":"Noji","id":"38546916100"},{"name":"Shuntaro Tashiro","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuntaro","lastName":"Tashiro","id":"38548454600"},{"name":"Shigeo Kawasaki","affiliation":["Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan AeroSpace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Kawasaki","id":"37409825800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421774","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Cryogenics","Temperature","Gain","MMICs","Radio astronomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","cryogenic electronics","gallium arsenide","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","radioastronomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryogenic high gain amplifier module","low-noise amplifier module","radio astronomy","LNA module","cryogenic cooling","pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor","pHEMT","monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology","MMIC technology","MMIC amplifier","cryogenic equipments","frequency 10 GHz","size 0.15 mum","temperature 113 K","temperature 71 K","noise figure 0.96 dB","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaAs Amplifier","radio astronomy","MMIC","low noise amplifier","pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT)","cryogenic electronics"]}],"abstract":"A small size low noise amplifier (LNA) module operating at 10GHz capable of a cryogenic cooling for radio astronomy is presented.

Generally, digital predistortion needs the bandwidth of feedforward and feedback signal several times higher than the transmission bandwidth to achieve reasonable good linearization performance. To reduce the bandwidth requirement on feedback signal path a novel approach, in which the coefficients would be approached step by step, is presented in this paper. Through optimizing the parameters the impact on linearization performance caused by feedback signal with incomplete spectral information can be significantly alleviate.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421788","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421788.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","startPage":"950","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital predistortion using feedback signal with incomplete spectral information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital predistortion using feedback signal with incomplete spectral information","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421788/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270004","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6421788/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital predistortion using feedback signal with incomplete spectral information","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4B106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09988S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421792,"authors":[{"name":"Silong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Silong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38548495200"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421792","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Band pass filters","Polynomials","Predistortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","FIR filters","Long Term Evolution","low-pass filters","power amplifiers","VHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low sampling rate digital predistortion","bandpass RF filter","output signals","ADC sampling rate","band-limited memory polynomial model","BLMP model","low-pass FIR filter","GaN Doherty power amplifier","2-carrier LTE-A signal","band-pass RF filter","ACPR","wideband application","frequency 40 MHz","frequency 70 MHz","frequency 35 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Predistortion","Power Amplifier","Band-Limited","Memory Polynomial"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421792","abstract":"In this paper, a low sampling rate digital predistortion of power amplifier assisted by bandpass RF filter is demonstrated. Owing to RF filter integrated after power amplifier, the spectral regrowth of output signals is restricted into a limited bandwidth, which alleviates the burden of ADC sampling rate efficiently. By adopting a band-limited memory polynomial(BLMP) model, the bandwidth of every product terms in memory polynomial model is controlled with a low-pass FIR filter. A GaN Doherty power amplifier excited by a 40 MHz 2-carrier LTE-A Signal is employed to validate this approach. With 2 times over-sampling, a 70 MHz band-pass RF filter and a 35 MHz low-pass FIR filter, the output ACPR is successfully improved from -34.9 dBc to -46.0 dBc with a sampling rate of only 92.16 Msps. The experiment result shows that this approach works much better than the traditional methodologies based on memory polynomial(MP) in the situation of wideband application.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421792","startPage":"962","endPage":"964","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421792.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low sampling rate digital predistortion of power amplifier assisted by bandpass RF filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low sampling rate digital predistortion of power amplifier assisted by bandpass RF filter","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421792/","accessionNumber":"13270008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421792/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low sampling rate digital predistortion of power amplifier assisted by bandpass RF filter","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4B110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038362S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6421815,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Terasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Iwate University, Morioka, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Terasaki","id":"38474139700"},{"name":"Naoki Honma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Iwate University, Morioka, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Honma","id":"37277559500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421815","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Reflection coefficient","Modulation","Varactors","Transmitting antennas","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor communication","MIMO communication","radiofrequency identification","transmitting antennas","varactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive MIMO transmission","multiple input multiple output transmission","varactor diodes","variable reactance element","bias voltage","reflection coefficients","indoor environment","tag antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","RFID tags","MIMO","Digital modulation","Phase modulation"]}],"abstract":"In the passive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission scheme, load modulation is applied to the multi-antenna, and a number of signals can be transmitted in parallel.

The transmit-array is placed at the aperture between two enclosed rooms to increase the number of the paths.

With a controller and switches, we can change the rf current distribution by enabling or disabling the current draggers.

In order to control the isolation loss and the radiation directivity, various antenna positions were considered.

When two antennas had a same current direction, it was satisfied isolation loss of -15 dB below. Otherwise, it had isolation loss of -10 dB above. Radiation pattern is also controlled by current direction and antenna position. The proposed LTE-MIMO antennas with different tilting radiation direction as shown in (1-2) and (4-1) of Fig. 4 (b) and Fig. 6 (b) is a good ECC candidate.

An intentional coupling is introduced by inserting a second-order coupled resonator filter network between two coupled antennas. With properly controlled magnitude and phase, this coupling can cancel the existing mutual coupling between the two antennas. A prototype is realized on an FR4 PCB for demonstration purpose. Measurement results indicate that both port matching and decoupling can be achieved simultaneously. Specifically, return loss of no less than 6dB and isolation of more than 20dB can be achieved for 11% fractional bandwidth. Moreover, measured radiation efficiency and envelop correlation at the center frequency are 74% and -56dB respectively. The proposed decoupling network is suitable for diversity antennas and other size-limited multi-antenna systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421860.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1174","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel second-order decoupling network for two-element compact antenna arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Resonator filters","Ports (Computers)","Passive filters","Correlation","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband antennas","next generation networks","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order decoupling network","two-element compact antenna arrays","broadband decoupling network","second-order coupled resonator filter network","FR4 PCB","multi-antenna systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","decoupling network","filter synthesis","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel second-order decoupling network for two-element compact antenna arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270076","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel second-order decoupling network for two-element compact antenna arrays","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4C405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068492S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6421862,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Jui Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yun-Jui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37966114500"},{"name":"Gang-Wei Cao","affiliation":["Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gang-Wei","lastName":"Cao","id":"38547449300"},{"name":"Shyh-Jong Chung","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37278469100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421862","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Gain","Microstrip filters","Microstrip antennas","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","multifrequency antennas","polarisation","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-band filtering microstrip antenna","polarization planes","WLAN bands","slot-loaded patch","half-wavelength stepped-impedance resonator","full-wave simulator","HFSS","coupling coefficients","frequency 2.4 GHz","frequency 5.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filtering microstrip antenna","bandpass filter","broadside coupling","the same polarization plane"]}],"abstract":"A novel compact dual-band filtering antenna operated in WLAN bands is presented.

Numerical results are presented to compare various current source implementations for the fundamental SS2-FDTD method.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421899","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421899.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current source implementations for fundamental SS2-FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421899/","displayDocTitle":"Current source implementations for fundamental SS2-FDTD method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270115","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421899/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current source implementations for fundamental SS2-FDTD method","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4D302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087852S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6421904,"authors":[{"name":"Bailing Ren","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bailing","lastName":"Ren","id":"38252297600"},{"name":"Shiyong Li","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiyong","lastName":"Li","id":"37292195600"},{"name":"Houjun Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Houjun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291000500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"6421904","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Arrays","Compressed sensing","Planar arrays","Green function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","numerical analysis","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","near range two dimensional imaging","planar array two dimensional imaging","scanning time","antenna elements","sparse planar array","image reconstruction","two dimensional fast smoothed algorithm","paraxial Green function","sensing matrix","matched filter processing","numerical simulations","focusing performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","matched filter processing","paraxial Green function","two dimensional imaging","security detection","Smoothed L0","sparse objects"]}],"abstract":"Planar array two dimensional (2D) imaging is an important technology. It saves scanning time, but needs a large number of antenna elements. In order to save the cost, we hope to use less antennas to get the same (or better) image results. In this paper, we use sparse planar array and reconstruct the image by the two dimensional fast smoothed L0 (2D-SL0) algorithm. Paraxial Green function is used as sensing matrix. Comparisons of the algorithms based on 2D-SL0 algorithm and the matched filter processing (MFP) are demonstrated by means of numerical simulations. It is obvious that the imaging results by the 2D-SL0 algorithm is much clearer. And the focusing performance of the algorithm based on the 2D-SL0 algorithm is very well, even when we use the sparse antenna array.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2012.6421904","publicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410220/6421477/06421904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2012.6421904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421477","startPage":"1307","endPage":"1309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm based on the compressed sensing for near range two dimensional imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm based on the compressed sensing for near range two dimensional imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421904/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270120","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6421904/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm based on the compressed sensing for near range two dimensional imaging","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4D307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074635S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410220","isNumber":"6421477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410220","xplore-issue":"6421477","articleId":"6421904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6421940,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Accordingly, we present recognition results of two newly developed news transcription systems for Polish and Romanian languages, which are trained in fully data-driven manner based on only a few hours of manual transcriptions and web materials. Besides, an automatic language model updating method is also presented for our Hungarian transcription system. Continuous updating of the language model resulted in 2% relative WER (Word Error Rate) reduction measured on a 3 month long period primarily due to better language model parameter matching for IV (Intra Vocabulary) words and secondary due the reduction of OOV (Out Of Vocabulary) words. To the best of our knowledge, the first Romanian broadcast news recognition results are published in this study.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413305/6421929/06421940.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)","doi":"10.1109/CogInfoCom.2012.6421940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CogInfoCom.2012.6421940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6421940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast news transcription in Central-East European languages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Speech","Speech recognition","Training","Databases","TV","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","LVCSR","morphologically rich languages","broadcast news","Hungarian","Polish","Romanian","cognitive infocommunication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6421940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast news transcription in Central-East European languages","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6421940/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast news transcription in Central-East European languages","confLoc":"Kosice, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"10coginfocom2012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06897S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413305","isNumber":"6421929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413305","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6421929","articleId":"6421940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6421958,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Proper precoding and pulse shaping of non-return to zero (NRZ) waveforms are necessary prior to digital modulation for limiting the bandwidth of power spectrum of the NRZ pulses. The most common pulse shapes used are Gaussian filter for Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK), raised cosine filters, etc. Recently shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK) is introduced as a bandwidth efficient modulation technique. In this paper, we report the bandwidth efficiency of SOQPSK for S-band airborne data links working at 4 Mbps rate [1]. Our results show that the SOQPSK-TG is the more bandwidth efficient modulation scheme than GMSK for telemetry applications.","doi":"10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422125","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414853/6422119/06422125.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telemetry applications of SOQPSK and GMSK based modulation for airborne platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422125/","displayDocTitle":"Telemetry applications of SOQPSK and GMSK based modulation for airborne platforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422125/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telemetry applications of SOQPSK and GMSK based modulation for airborne platforms","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP006298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065495S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422129,"authors":[{"name":"Tanumay Manna","affiliation":["Department of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Tanumay","lastName":"Manna","id":"38548397300"},{"name":"Iti Saha Misra","affiliation":["Department of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Iti Saha","lastName":"Misra","id":"38186220300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4700-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4699-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4698-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6422129","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Intelligent systems","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","modulation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic spectrum sharing","cognitive radios","Nash-equilibrium","modulation schemes","non-cooperative systems","non-cooperative spectrum sharing","global utility function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","nash equilibrium","spectrum sharing unlicensed bands","gaussian interference channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper explains the use of game theory to be applied for spectrum sharing scenario in unlicensed bands. A multi variable payoff function [2] is used to illustrate the process of achieving Nash-Equilibrium by varying the various modulation schemes and power for two non-cooperative systems sharing the same spectrum. This non-cooperative spectrum sharing often leads to a situation where one system is at a disadvantageous position. The situation can be improved if a global utility function is considered that represents a fairness objective. A modified global utility function is proposed that improves the Nash-Equilibrium condition for the two systems scenario than the already existing ones.","doi":"10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422129","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414853/6422119/06422129.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422129","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game theoretic spectrum sharing for cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Game theoretic spectrum sharing for cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422129/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422129/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272502","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game theoretic spectrum sharing for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP010210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051323S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6422131,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Ranjan","affiliation":["Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"38547753400"},{"name":"Debjani Mitra","affiliation":["Department of electronics Engineering, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India"],"firstName":"Debjani","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37553664800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4700-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4699-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4698-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6422131","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","error statistics","forward error correction","hidden Markov models","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","statistical distributions","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["order estimation","HMM discrete channel model","OFDM systems","high data rate wireless access networks","international standards","FEC","interleaving code schemes","hidden Markov discrete channel modelling","Baum-Welch algorithms","BWA","wireless standards","HMM based error patterns","autocorrelation functions","error interval distribution probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Model","Baum Welch Algorithm","Discrete Channel Modeling","AWGN","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"OFDM systems popularly being used in current high data rate wireless access networks and international standards are practically implemented using FEC and interleaving schemes whose performance evaluation and analysis can greatly benefit from Discrete Channel Models developed for the underlying channel.

Over the years a plenty of researches had been done in this field of satellite handover management, but the problem remains unsolved. One such method is the reservation of a few channels specifically for handover calls. One demerit of this scheme is that not all channels are available for allocation of new calls, leading to an increase in new call blocking probability. Also this scheme may lead to unnecessary reservation of channels for handover even when the number of handovers is very small. During such a period the reserved channels could have been used for allocation of new calls. So, in this paper we are going to propose a new Neighbour Location Based Channel Reservation scheme for efficient utilization of resources (channels) in handover and new channel allocation in LEO Satellite communication. In this scheme, we are reserving few channels in each spot beam especially for handoff based on the number of mobile stations in neighbour locations and the average handover call arrival rate. In the simulation, this approach reduces the unnecessary complexity and unnecessary reservation of resources (channels) which in turn reduces the complexity of the communication network.","doi":"10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422139","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414853/6422119/06422139.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbour Location Based Channel Reservation scheme for LEO Satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422139/","displayDocTitle":"Neighbour Location Based Channel Reservation scheme for LEO Satellite communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272511","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422139/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbour Location Based Channel Reservation scheme for LEO Satellite communication","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP020288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069505S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6422150,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The two algorithms are compared for null depth, multiple interference, maximum sidelobe level and rate of convergence.","doi":"10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422184","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414853/6422119/06422184.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422184","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","startPage":"246","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study of beamforming techniques using LMS and SMI algorithms in smart antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study of beamforming techniques using LMS and SMI algorithms in smart antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422184/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272544","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study of beamforming techniques using LMS and SMI algorithms in smart antennas","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP065315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059984S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6422200,"authors":[{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Mahua Raha Patra","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Mahua Raha","lastName":"Patra","id":"38547357000"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4700-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4699-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4698-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6422200","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Optical sensors","Table lookup","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical mixing","Blood","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","bioMEMS","blood","data acquisition","drops","integration","lab-on-a-chip","medical diagnostic computing","microfluidics","micro-optics","microsensors","optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual mode bioassay detection analyzer","digital microfluidic biochips","real-time biochemical analysis","biomedical operations","bioassay protocol","heterogeneous photonic component integration","miniaturized optical sensing technology","complex optical detection functions","dual mode droplet detection analyzer","automated detailed analysis","data acquisition","homogeneous samples","heterogeneous samples","blood"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Microfluidics","Biochips","Optical detection","Analysis","Test and diagnostics","Bioassay protocols","integration"]}],"abstract":"Digital microfluidic biochips in recent years have been emerged as an alternative platform for performance of real time biochemical analysis and safety critical biomedical operations. Detection and analysis is a major task for biochemical analysis required to be performed on completion of a specific bioassay protocol in a digital microfluidic system. With the development of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies it has become possible to integrate miniaturized optical sensing technologies that enable complex optical detection functions to be incorporated within the microfluidic platform. In this paper we have proposed a novel design of dual mode droplet detection analyzer to be coupled with a targeted biochip for providing automated detailed analysis based on the data acquired through optical detection. The proposed design employed in two modes - for both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples enables automated detection and analysis of different samples based on predefined characterized results. The architecture, synthesis and simulation of the proposed droplet analyzer for signals obtained for different bioassay protocols has been described in this paper - and the results are found to be quite encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422200","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications, Devices and Intelligent Systems (CODIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6414853/6422119/06422200.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CODIS.2012.6422200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New design of a dual mode bioassay detection analyzer for digital microfluidic biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422200/","displayDocTitle":"A New design of a dual mode bioassay detection analyzer for digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285703","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422200/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New design of a dual mode bioassay detection analyzer for digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP081321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11649S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6422201,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Initially the paths generated by the algorithm will be negotiable paths. However, the robot chooses the appropriate path as it acquires more knowledge about the environment. The architecture is generated for the algorithm through Xilinx synthesis tool and also makes uses of data from sensors for processing.

It has also become obvious that the most important resources for the wireless communication require a much better way of exploiting the ether medium frequency spectrum for the future generation of radio and wireless communication. In order to increase the spectrum efficiency the cognitive users to whom bands have not been licensed can access the frequency band dynamically in an opportunistic manner by supporting the spectrum reuse functionality, thereby sensing the radio frequency environment until the primary users are inactive. In this article we have calculated the activity factor of secondary user for a threshold value of the total spectrum usage. Further a relationship between the detection sensitivity, threshold and activity of secondary users could be established by keeping in view of the transmitted parameters. Dynamic spectrum access technique allows the user to operate in the best available channel in terms of the application requirement and available spectrum pool characteristic like channel capacity, possible interference, path loss, possible channel holding time etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272575","htmlLink":"/document/6422223/","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Reusability of spectrum in Cognitive radio network using threshold","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reusability of spectrum in Cognitive radio network using threshold","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"RP104072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058385S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6414853","isNumber":"6422119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6414853","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6422119","articleId":"6422223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6422224,"authors":[{"name":"Anirban Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["ECE Department, Dr. B.

Cognitive radio (CR) users which employ energy detectors (EDs) are censored depending on the quality of radio channels between them and a fusion center (FC). A training based channel estimator is used at the FC to estimate the log-normal shadowing coefficients characterizing the channels between the CR users and the FC. Each CR makes a hard decision about primary user (PU) using energy detection and transmits the information to FC using BPSK signaling if the CR user is selected to transmit. A majority logic fusion rule is applied at the FC for estimating the performance in terms of missed detection and total error probability for both perfect and imperfect channel estimation.

While evaluating frequency response for some application it is also important to extend the bandwidth of an amplifier. Extending the bandwidth means increasing the upper 3 dB frequency and decreasing the lower 3 dB limit. Although there are different means by which this extension can be achieved, we have chosen the application of negative feedback for the purpose. We have derived some new topologies using three blocks representation from derived existing topologies, which fulfill our bandwidth requirements. We specially describe the use of cascading series-shunt, series-series and shunt-shunt type of feedback amplifiers as a composite block.

Path computation process is crucial to achieve the desired TE objective. Its actual effectiveness depends on a number of factors. Mechanisms utilized to update topology and TE information, as well as the latency between path computation and resource reservation, which is typically distributed, may affect path computation efficiency. Moreover, TE visibility is limited in many network scenarios, such as multi-layer, multi-domain and multi-carrier networks, and it may negatively impact resource utilization. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has promoted the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, proposing a dedicated network entity devoted to path computation process. The PCE represents a flexible instrument to overcome visibility and distributed provisioning inefficiencies. Communications between path computation clients (PCC) and PCEs, realized through the PCE Protocol (PCEP), also enable inter-PCE communications offering an attractive way to perform TE-based path computation among cooperating PCEs in multi-layer/domain scenarios, while preserving scalability and confidentiality. This survey presents the state-of-the-art on the PCE architecture for GMPLS-controlled networks carried out by research and standardization community. In this work, packet (i.e., MPLS-TE and MPLS-TP) and wavelength/spectrum (i.e., WSON and SSON) switching capabilities are the considered technological platforms, in which the PCE is shown to achieve a number of evident benefits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.011413.00087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6661627/06422287.pdf","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.011413.00087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6422287/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2013","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2013","accessionNumber":"13897586","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on the Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture","sourcePdf":"15Paolucci87.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.244486S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6661627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6661627","articleId":"6422287","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6422288,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Pudlewski","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6512259/6422288/6422288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Scott Pudlewski [M'2007] (scott.pudlewski@ll.mit.edu) received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY in 2008, and his M.S. and Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo, NY in 2010 and 2012 respectively.

One of the most promising applications of CS is compressive imaging. Leveraging the fact that images can be represented as approximately sparse signals in a transformed domain, images can be compressed and sampled simultaneously using low-complexity linear operations. Recently, these techniques have been extended beyond imaging to encode video. Much of the compression in traditional video encoding comes from using motion vectors to take advantage of the temporal correlation between adjacent frames. However, calculating motion vectors is a processing-intensive operation that causes significant power consumption. Therefore, any technique appropriate for resource constrained video sensors must exploit temporal correlation through low-complexity operations. In this tutorial, we first briefly discuss challenges involved in the transmission of video over a wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). We then discuss the different techniques available for applying CS encoding first to images, and then to videos for error-resilient transmission in lossy channels. Existing solutions are examined, and compared in terms of applicability to wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). Finally, open issues are discussed and future research trends are outlined.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2012.121912.00154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2012.121912.00154","startPage":"754","endPage":"767","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6512259/06422288.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6512259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tutorial on Encoding and Wireless Transmission of Compressively Sampled Videos","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Tutorial on Encoding and Wireless Transmission of Compressively Sampled Videos","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2013","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422288/","accessionNumber":"13475590","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422288/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tutorial on Encoding and Wireless Transmission of Compressively Sampled Videos","sourcePdf":"10Pudlewslki154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11607S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6512259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6512259","articleId":"6422288","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6422289,"authors":[{"name":"Savera Tanwir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6661627/6422289/6422289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Savera Tanwir received the BE degree in Computer Software Engineering from College of Signals' National University of Science and Technology (NUST), Pakistan in 2004 and Masters in Computer Networking from North Carolina State University (NCSU), USA in 2007.

An accurate traffic model of VBR video is necessary for performance evaluation of a network design and also for creating synthetic loads that can be used for benchmarking a network. In view of this, various models for VBR video traffic have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we classify and survey these models. In addition, we implemented four representative video traffic models and compared them using the H.264 AVC video traces available at the Arizona State University video traces library. These models are: the Markov Modulated Gamma (MMG) model, the Discrete Autoregressive (DAR) model, the second order Autoregressive AR(2) model, and a wavelet-based model. The results show that the MMG and the wavelet-based models are suitable for both video conference and IPTV, while the DAR model is good for video conference traffic only. According to our results, the AR(2) model is not suitable for generating any type of H.264 video.

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of BIAs for the computer networking field, in which different BIAs are organized and explored based on their: (1) biological source; (2) mathematical model; (3) major application; (4) advantages to corresponding \"classic\" approach; (5) limitations and border conditions; and (6) potential directions for future applications.

However, opportunistic schedulers for wireless systems have been studied since nearly twenty years, but not implemented in real systems due to their high complexity and hardly achievable requirements. In contrast, today's popularity of opportunistic schedulers extends to implementation proposals for next generation cellular technologies. Motivated by such a novel interest towards opportunistic scheduling, we provide a taxonomy for opportunistic schedulers, which is based on scheduling design's objectives; accordingly, we provide an extensive review of opportunistic scheduling proposals which have appeared in the literature during nearly two decades. The huge number of papers available in the literature propose different techniques to perform opportunistic scheduling, ranging from simple heuristic algorithms to complex mathematical models. Some proposals are only designed to increase the total network capacity, while others enhance QoS objectives such as throughput and fairness. Interestingly, our survey helps to unveil two major issues: (i) the research in opportunistic is mature enough to jump from pure theory to implementation, and (ii) there are still under-explored and interesting research areas in opportunistic scheduling, e.g., opportunistic offloading of cellular traffic to 802.11-like networks, or cooperative/distributed opportunistic scheduling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Opportunistic Scheduling in Wireless Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.011413.00082","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6661627/06422292.pdf","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.011413.00082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Opportunistic Scheduling in Wireless Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6422292/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2013","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2013","accessionNumber":"13913967","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Opportunistic Scheduling in Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"08Asadi82.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.232229S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6661627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6661627","articleId":"6422292","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6422293,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitris Kaseridis","affiliation":["ARM Inc., University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6774900/6422293/6422293-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dimitris Kaseridis received the BSc and MSc degrees from the University of Patras, Greece in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2011.

Previously proposed cache management schemes suffer from inefficient cache capacity utilization, by either focusing on improving the absolute number of cache misses or by allocating cache capacity without taking into consideration the applications' memory sharing characteristics. Reduction of the overall number of misses does not always correlate with higher performance as Memory-level Parallelism can hide the latency penalty of a significant number of misses in out-of-order execution. In this work we describe a quasi-partitioning scheme for last-level caches that combines the memory-level parallelism, cache friendliness and interference sensitivity of competing applications, to efficiently manage the shared cache capacity. The proposed scheme improves both system throughput and execution fairness - outperforming previous schemes that are oblivious to applications' memory behavior. Our detailed, full-system simulations showed an average improvement of 10 percent in throughput and 9 percent in fairness over the next best scheme for a four-core CMP system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6422293/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180426","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cache Friendliness-Aware Managementof Shared Last-Level Caches for HighPerformance Multi-Core Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Friendliness-Aware Managementof Shared Last-Level Caches for HighPerformance Multi-Core Systems","sourcePdf":"tc-kaser-18-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080257S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6774900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6774900","articleId":"6422293","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422297,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Chen Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan ROC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6871433/6422297/6422297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang-Chen Kuo received the MS degree in computer science and information engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, Republic of China, in 2006.

However, prefixes may be inserted into or deleted from the TCAM because of changes in Internet topology. Traditional TCAM coprocessors maintain the enclosure relationship among prefixes by using an extended binary trie and perform TCAM movements based on an update algorithm (e.g., CAO_OPT) which runs on a local CPU to maintain the speed and correctness of the TCAM search process. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient TCAM coprocessor architecture for updates that require only small memory size compared with the extended binary trie. The average number of TCAM movements per update is almost the same as that of CAO_OPT. However, the time to compute how to move TCAM entries in the proposed TCAM coprocessor is less than that in CAO_OPT. Only a small part of total TCAM search cycles is used to complete our update process. The proposed TCAM architecture can also be made smaller and faster because large off-chip memory for the extended binary trie and a local CPU are no longer necessary.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6871433/06422297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6871433","startPage":"2110","endPage":"2121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Memory-Efficient TCAM Coprocessor for IPv4/IPv6 Routing Table Update","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Memory-Efficient TCAM Coprocessor for IPv4/IPv6 Routing Table Update","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6422297/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Memory-Efficient TCAM Coprocessor for IPv4/IPv6 Routing Table Update","sourcePdf":"tc-chang-22-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067624S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6871433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6871433","articleId":"6422297","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6422318,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhou","affiliation":["AT&T Labs-Research, Middletown, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiang Zhou received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications in 1999.

A net spectral efficiency (SE) of 8.25 b/s/Hz was achieved, after excluding the 20% soft-decision forward-error-correction (FEC) overhead. Such a result was accomplished by the use of a recently proposed polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) time-domain hybrid 32-64 quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) format, along with improved carrier frequency and phase recovery algorithms. It is shown that time-domain hybrid QAM provides a new degree of design freedom to optimize the transmission performance by fine tuning the SE of the modulation format for a specific channel bandwidth and FEC redundancy requirement. In terms of carrier recovery, we demonstrate that 1) hardware efficient estimation and tracking of the frequency offset between the signal and local-oscillator (LO) can be achieved by using a new feedback-based method, and 2) a training-assisted two-stage phase estimation algorithm effectively mitigates cyclic phase slipping problems. This new phase recovery algorithm not only improves the receiver sensitivity by eliminating the need for differential coding and decoding, but also enables an additional equalization stage following the phase recovery. We have shown that the introduction of this additional equalization stage (with larger number of taps) helps reduce the implementation penalty. This paper also presents the first experimental study of the impact of inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) correlation for a high-order QAM.

Colorless operation is achieved by self-seeding an ultra-fast reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) with the feedback signal reflected at the WDM multiplexer filter. In particular, the transmitter exploits a 2-Faraday rotators configuration to ensure polarization insensitive operation and allowing for the exploitation of high gain RSOAs, which can be designed to operate on a single polarization. The impact on the transmission of the fiber chromatic dispersion at different bit-rates and with different channel bandwidths of the WDM multiplexer filter is experimentally investigated up to 10.7 Gb/s. The tolerance to positive and negative dispersive loads is also assessed.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2013.2243138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2013.2243138","startPage":"637","endPage":"640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6478805/06422326.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Up to 10.7-Gb/s High-PDG RSOA-Based Colorless Transmitter for WDM Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Up to 10.7-Gb/s High-PDG RSOA-Based Colorless Transmitter for WDM Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2013","volume":"25","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422326/","accessionNumber":"13382560","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422326/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Up to 10.7-Gb/s High-PDG RSOA-Based Colorless Transmitter for WDM Networks","sourcePdf":"lpt-marazzi-2243138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070117S","chronDate":"April1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6478805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6478805","articleId":"6422326","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6422327,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Fang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37272213800"},{"name":"Yumeng Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yumeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38547032000"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6422327","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422327","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Quantization","Wireless sensor networks","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bandwidth","Probability density function","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantisation (signal)","sensor fusion","signal detection","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantizer design","multisensor GLRT fusion","binary data","fusion center","generalized likelihood ratio test detector","imperfect channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized detection","one-bit quantization","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2243144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Bit Quantizer Design for Multisensor GLRT Fusion","startPage":"257","endPage":"260","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6414626/06422327.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2243144","abstract":"In this letter, we consider a decentralized detection problem in which a number of sensor nodes collaborate to detect the presence of an unknown deterministic signal. Due to stringent power/bandwidth constraints, each sensor quantizes its local observation into one bit of information. The binary data are then sent to the fusion center (FC), where a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to make a global decision. In this context, we study one-bit quantizer design and analyze the asymptotic performance of the one-bit GLRT detector for cases where the quantized data are sent to the FC via perfect or imperfect channels.

With the increasing number of services available within an enterprise and over the Internet, locating a service online may not be appropriate from the performance perspective, especially in large Internet-based service repositories. Instead, services usually need to be clustered according to their similarity. Thereafter, services in one or several clusters are necessary to be examined online during dynamic service discovery. In this paper, we propose to cluster data providing (DP) services using a refined fuzzy C-means algorithm. We consider the composite relation between DP service elements (i.e., input, output, and semantic relation between them) when representing DP services in terms of vectors. A DP service vector is assigned to one or multiple clusters with certain degrees. In addition, we introduce some operations for managing service clusters, when new services emerge or existing services disappear or become unavailable. When grouping similar services into one cluster, while partitioning different services into different clusters, the capability of service search engine is improved significantly. We have prototyped our approach and the source code is freely available on the web. We have evaluated our clustering approach in different settings and the results are very promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422338/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13811274","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Providing Services Clustering and Management for Facilitating Service Discovery and Replacement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Providing Services Clustering and Management for Facilitating Service Discovery and Replacement","sourcePdf":"tase-zhou-2237551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18675S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6617709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6617709","articleId":"6422338","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422351,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Paolo Garcia Ariza","affiliation":["MEDAV GmbH, Uttenreuth, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6493417/6422351/6422351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexis Paolo Garcia Ariza received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Industrial University of Santander (UIS), Bucaramanga, Colombia, in 2002, and the Doctoral degree in telecommunications from Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), Valencia, Spain, in 2009 (with the support of the European Al\u00dfan Program).","He was Assistant Professor in the fields of Mobile Communications, Antennas, Satellite Communications, and Radio Network Planning Tools.

In this paper, we propose a 60 GHz ultra-wideband (UWB) polarimetric multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) sensing system architecture and polarimetric signal processing for short-range communications and radar. Demonstration measurements were made by using an UWB radar interface. By measurements in multipath rich environments it is demonstrated that tap-wise polarimetric filtering in delay domain can enhance the 60 GHz link budget by filtering some paths and then reducing shadowing due to human activity. Additionally, optimum MIMO polarimetric filtering is proposed to reduce heavy clutter for mm-W radar, increasing by about 30 dB the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise-ratio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60 GHz Ultrawideband Polarimetric MIMO Sensing for Wireless Multi-Gigabit and Radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2243398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6493417/06422351.pdf","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2243398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"60 GHz Ultrawideband Polarimetric MIMO Sensing for Wireless Multi-Gigabit and Radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6422351/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413035","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60 GHz Ultrawideband Polarimetric MIMO Sensing for Wireless Multi-Gigabit and Radar","sourcePdf":"tap-garciaariza-2243398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097406S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6493417","articleId":"6422351","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422364,"authors":[{"name":"Ku He","affiliation":["Cirrus Logic, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6522482/6422364/6422364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ku He (M'12) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA, in 2012.","Since 2012, he has been with Cirrus Logic, Inc., Austin, as a Mixed-Signal Design Engineer, whose tasks include designing high-resolution and low-power audio-band integrated circuits.

Conventional very large scale integration design strategies do not exploit this degree of error tolerance and aim to guarantee timing correctness, thereby sacrificing energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose techniques for timing error acceptance to improve the quality-energy tradeoff in image and video processing systems under scaled \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VDD</i>\n. The basic philosophy is to prevent signal quality from severe degradation, on average, by using data statistics. The introduced innovations include techniques for carefully controlling possible errors and exploiting the specifics of error patterns for low-cost postprocessing to minimize quality degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on a 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) and a 2-D DCT design. The designs were synthesized using a 45-nm standard cell library, with energy and delay evaluated using NanoSim and VCS. Experiments show that direct applications of controlled error-acceptance techniques allow up to 59% and 71% energy savings by permitting fewer than 1-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease for the 2-D IDCT and DCT designs, respectively. The resulting PSNR remains above 30dB, which is a commonly accepted value for lossy image and video compression. Achieving such energy savings by direct \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VDD</i>\n scaling without the proposed transformations results in a 12-dB PSNR loss. The area overhead for the needed control logic is about 4.8% of the original design. To further minimize quality degradation caused by accepted errors in the IDCT, we introduce postfiltering on the output image. The significant improvement of the perceived image quality allows further voltage scaling leading to overall energy savings of 70% for the 2-D IDCT, while costing an additional 1.1% in area.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2243658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6522482/06422364.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2243658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6522482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-Level Timing-Error Acceptance for Design of Energy-Efficient DCT/IDCT-Based Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-Level Timing-Error Acceptance for Design of Energy-Efficient DCT/IDCT-Based Systems","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13531330","htmlLink":"/document/6422364/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-Level Timing-Error Acceptance for Design of Energy-Efficient DCT/IDCT-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-he-2243658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070857S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6522482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6522482","articleId":"6422364","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6422367,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaotai Pan","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China","Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6522482/6422367/6422367-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhaotai Pan received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include compound image/video compression."]},"firstName":"Zhaotai","lastName":"Pan","id":"37714905300"},{"name":"Huifeng Shen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6522482/6422367/6422367-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Huifeng Shen received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","From 2007 to 2010, he was with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, as a Research Intern.

In this paper, we present a block-based low-complexity screen compression scheme, in which multiple block modes are adopted to exploit the intra- and inter-frame redundancies. In particular, we classify the intra-coded blocks to pictorial blocks and textual blocks using a proposed fast block classification algorithm, which exploits the discriminative features between the pictorial and the textual blocks. Then, we design a low-complexity, yet efficient, algorithm to compress the textual blocks. We use base colors and escape colors to represent and quantize the textual pixels, which not only achieves high compression ratios but also preserves a high quality on textual pixels. The two-dimensionally predictive index coding and hierarchical pattern coding technologies are used to exploit local spatial correlations and global pattern correlation, respectively. To further utilize the correlation between the luminance and chrominance channels, we propose a joint-channel index coding method. We compare the coding efficiency and the computational complexity of the proposed scheme against the standard image coding schemes such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and PNG, the compound image compressor HJPC, and the popular video coding standard H.264. We also compare the visual quality of the proposed scheme against H.264 intra coding, JPEG2000, and HJPC.

Results include the spatial and temporal distribution of cloud fraction, the cloud top pressure and cloud top temperature, and the cloud optical thickness and effective radius of both liquid water and ice clouds. Globally, the cloud fraction derived by the MODIS cloud mask is ~ 67%, with somewhat more clouds over land during the afternoon and less clouds over ocean in the afternoon, with very little difference in global cloud cover between Terra and Aqua. Overall, the cloud fraction over land is ~ 55%, with a distinctive seasonal cycle, whereas the ocean cloudiness is much higher, around 72%, with much reduced seasonal variation. Aqua and Terra have comparable zonal cloud top pressures, with Aqua having somewhat higher clouds (cloud top pressures lower by 100 hPa) over land due to afternoon deep convection. The coldest cloud tops (colder than 230 K) generally occur over Antarctica and the high clouds in the tropics. The cloud effective particle radius of liquid water clouds is significantly larger over ocean (mode 12-13 \u03bcm) than land (mode 10-11 \u03bcm), consistent with the variation in hygroscopic aerosol concentrations that provide cloud condensation nuclei necessary for cloud formation. We also find the effective radius to be 2-3 \u03bcm larger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, likely reflecting differences in sources of cloud condensation nuclei.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","volume":"51","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13583266","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6422379/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Clouds Observed by MODIS Onboard the Terra and Aqua Satellites","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Clouds Observed by MODIS Onboard the Terra and Aqua Satellites","sourcePdf":"tgrs-king-2227333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174924S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6544631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6544631","articleId":"6422379","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6422382,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Christopher","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6480818/6422382/6422382-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edward Christopher (A'09) received the B.Eng. degree and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been a Research Fellow with the Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Nottingham, where he has worked on power electronics systems for automotive, marine, and renewable energy applications.

This paper begins by evaluating the self-sensing position estimation performance of a suitably designed FI-IPMSM machine using different high-frequency injection methods. This paper then uses an alternative square-wave injection method to estimate the FI-IPMSM rotor position. The experiment results show that the estimation accuracy and system robustness are improved. It is known that secondary saliencies and saliency offset caused by the saturation of the machine can degrade the estimation accuracy.

Commonly used transceiver design criteria including weighted mean-square-error (MSE) minimization, capacity maximization, worst-MSE/MAX-MSE minimization and weighted sum-rate maximization, are considered and unified into a single matrix-variate optimization problem. A general robust design algorithm is proposed to solve the unified problem. Specifically, by exploiting majorization theory and properties of matrix-variate functions, the optimal structure of the robust transceiver is derived when either the covariance matrix of channel estimation errors seen from the transmitter side or the corresponding covariance matrix seen from the receiver side is proportional to an identity matrix. Based on the optimal structure, the original transceiver design problems are reduced to much simpler problems with only scalar variables whose solutions are readily obtained by an iterative water-filling algorithm. A number of existing transceiver design algorithms are found to be special cases of the proposed solution. The differences between our work and the existing related work are also discussed in detail. The performance advantages of the proposed robust designs are demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2243439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6451284/06422411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2243439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451284","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Robust Linear Transceiver Design for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Robust Linear Transceiver Design for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13306732","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6422411/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Robust Linear Transceiver Design for Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-ma-2243439-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107477S","chronDate":"March1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6451284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6451284","articleId":"6422411","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422412,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

The estimation problem is parameterized in detail and based on an equivalent signal model its dimensionality is reduced to minimize the overhead associated with phase noise estimation. New exact and closed-form expressions for the Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (BCRLBs) and soft-input maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators for online, i.e., filtering, and offline, i.e., smoothing, estimation of phase noise over the length of a frame are derived. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed MAP estimators' mean-square error (MSE) performances are very close to the derived BCRLBs at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios. To reduce the overhead and complexity associated with tracking the phase noise processes over the length of a frame, a novel soft-input extended Kalman filter (EKF) and extended Kalman smoother (EKS) that use soft statistics of the transmitted symbols given the current observations are proposed. Numerical results indicate that by employing the proposed phase tracking approach, the bit-error rate performance of a MIMO system affected by phase noise can be significantly improved. In addition, simulation results indicate that the proposed phase noise estimation scheme allows for application of higher order modulations and larger numbers of antennas in MIMO systems that employ imperfect oscillators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Noise in MIMO Systems: Bayesian Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bounds and Soft-Input Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2243444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6504823/06422412.pdf","startPage":"2675","endPage":"2692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2243444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Phase Noise in MIMO Systems: Bayesian Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bounds and Soft-Input Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6422412/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","publicationDate":"May15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13730215","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Noise in MIMO Systems: Bayesian Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Bounds and Soft-Input Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-mehrpouyan-2243444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200309S","chronDate":"May15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6504823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6504823","articleId":"6422412","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422414,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Mu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6476733/6422414/6422414-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Mu (S'11) received the B.S. degree in applied physics from Northeastern University, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA, in 2012.","She has been a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, since January 2013.

The design criterion is minimum mean-square error (MMSE) of all secondary users under a transmit power constraint for each transmitting node and a constraint on the interference to primary network assuming complete knowledge of the channel state information is available. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the precoding matrices at secondary source nodes and relay node, and the decoding matrices at secondary nodes, where each subproblem is convex. To reduce the computational complexity, a matrix distance based non-iterative algorithm which can be implemented in a distributed manner is also proposed. Given the fact that perfect channel state information is usually non-realistic, a robust precoder design is also proposed to address this problem.

The total angular field-of-view is first divided into several small sectors and the original noise subspace exploited by the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is mapped from one sector to the other sectors by a Hadarmard product transformation. This transformation gives a new noise-like subspace cluster (NLSC), whose intersection is found to be simultaneously orthogonal to the steering vectors associated with the true DOAs and several virtual DOAs. Based on such a multiple orthogonality, a novel compressed MUSIC (C-MUSIC) spatial spectrum at hand is derived. Unlike MUSIC with tremendous spectral search, C-MUSIC involves a limited search over only one sector, and hence it is computationally very attractive. To obtain the intersection of NLSC for more than two sectors, a low-complexity method is also proposed in the present work, which shows advantages over the existing alternative projection method (APM) and singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques. Furthermore, the mean square errors (MSEs) of the proposed estimator is derived. Simulation results illustrate that C-MUSIC trades-off MSEs by complexity and resolution as compared to the standard MUSIC efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2243442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6482682/06422415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2243442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482682","startPage":"1915","endPage":"1930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity DOA Estimation Based on Compressed MUSIC and Its Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity DOA Estimation Based on Compressed MUSIC and Its Performance Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13396866","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6422415/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity DOA Estimation Based on Compressed MUSIC and Its Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-ming-2243442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123731S","chronDate":"April15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6482682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6482682","articleId":"6422415","onlineDate":"28 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6422428,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Z\u00e1rate-de Landa","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s Z\u00e1rate-de","lastName":"Landa","id":"38277071400"},{"name":"M.

This is even more so for recognizers designed for specific tasks. Naturally, an ASR for spelling recognition performs better if it is trained with a spelling speech corpus rather than a generic one. Although several speech corpora are available in Thai, we are still lack of Thai spelling speech corpora. This paper reports collection of experiences gained from constructing CU-MFEC, a Thai spelling speech corpus designed for form filling or other applications of similar nature. CU-MFEC corpus employed 100 speakers and encompassed 58 hours and 10 minutes of speech. There are four sets of the corpus; Alphabets with short pauses, Continuous free spelling, Sentences, and Numbers and commands. We evaluated its efficiency by utilizing CU-MFEC with speech recognition tasks and found the accuracy rate of 79.37% for spelling task and 54.92% for connected spelling task.","doi":"10.1109/ICSDA.2012.6422471","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Speech Database and Assessments","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Speech Database and Assessments","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416133/6422441/06422471.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2012.6422471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The CU-MFEC corpus for Thai and english spelling speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422471/","displayDocTitle":"The CU-MFEC corpus for Thai and english spelling speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271890","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422471/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The CU-MFEC corpus for Thai and english spelling speech recognition","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"0053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103986S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416133","isNumber":"6422441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416133","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6422441","articleId":"6422471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6422598,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Suk Kang","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ju-Suk Kang","id":"37087458696"},{"name":"Young-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Ho Kim","id":"37087364459"},{"name":"Sun-Jae Youn","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sun-Jae Youn","id":"37087459116"},{"name":"Chung-Yuen Won","affiliation":["Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chung-Yuen Won","id":"37087064717"},{"name":"Yong- Chae Jung","affiliation":["Namseoul University, Cheonan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong- Chae Jung","id":"37087195985"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"6422598","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Indexes","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","resonant invertors","switches","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active clamp flyback inverter","transformer","photovoltaic AC modules","leakage inductance components","control time","active clamp switch","primary switches","resonant capacitor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active clamp","leakage inductance","Photovoltaic AC modules","flyback converter","AC module system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422598","abstract":"In this paper, effects of leakage inductance components in active clamped flyback inverter are analyzed.

In the presented method, the neural network predictor is used to modify the reference value of the output voltage in the PID control to improve the transient response. This neural network control operates in coordination with the PID control. At the first, the neural network is repeatedly trained to predict the output voltage using former predicted data for the modification of the reference. After the training, the reference in the PID control is modified by the predictor to improve the transient response. This training process proceeds repeatedly until the enough suppression of the output voltage against the load change is obtained. As a result, the undershoot of the output voltage is considerably suppressed from 3.4% to 2.0% compared with the conventional method. The convergence time is suppressed to 52% compared with conventional method's one. Therefore, it is confirmed that the proposed method has the superior performance to control dc-dc converters compared to the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422649","startPage":"643","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422487","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410225/6422487/06422649.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new neural network predictor for digital control DC-DC converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422649/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new neural network predictor for digital control DC-DC converter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6422649/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13286300","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new neural network predictor for digital control DC-DC converter","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"GC30823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037057S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410225","isNumber":"6422487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410225","xplore-issue":"6422487","articleId":"6422649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6422663,"authors":[{"name":"Chol-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chol-Ho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656076200"},{"name":"Moon-Young Kim","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moon-Young Kim","id":"37087801669"},{"name":"Gun-Woo Moon","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gun-Woo","lastName":"Moon","id":"37277729800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"6422663","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":752},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Switches","Pulse width modulation","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","clamps","DC-DC power convertors","machine windings","secondary cells","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["individual cell equalizer","electric vehicle","Li-ion battery strings","battery's safety","series-connected lithium-ion cells","individual cell balancing","control complexity","active-clamp flyback DC-DC converter","parallel-primary connection","primary winding","transformer","selection switches","transformers","Li"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6422663","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422487","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6410225/6422487/06422663.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Individual cell equalizer using active-clamp flyback converter for li-ion battery strings in an electric vehicle","abstract":"The necessity of a charge equalizer is increasing for series-connected lithium-ion cells in electric vehicles. It is used to enhance the battery's safety and life cycle. For these reasons, the cell voltage levels should be individually monitored and effectively balanced in the battery string. However, individual cell balancing has the problem of size as well as the control complexity for a large number of battery cells. To alleviate these drawbacks, this paper proposes an individual cell equalizer with simple structure. In the proposed equalizer, each cell has its own active-clamp flyback DC-DC converter. A main switch and clamp switch in the converter are shared by every separated transformer through parallel-primary connection. This converter is utilized as a selectable current source by using selection switches in the primary winding of transformer. With this configuration, the simple structure and easy control can be effectively achieved for each cell even if the proposed equalizer has separated transformers as for the counts of battery cells. Furthermore, high equalization efficiency and outstanding equalization performance can be obtained for a high capacity battery. In this paper, a prototype for eight lithium-ion battery cells is optimally designed and implemented. Experimental results verify that the proposed equalization method has a good cell balanced performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6422663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6422663/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286314","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Individual cell equalizer using active-clamp flyback converter for li-ion battery strings in an electric vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Individual cell equalizer using active-clamp flyback converter for li-ion battery strings in an electric vehicle","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"GC50342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073553S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6410225","isNumber":"6422487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6410225","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6422487","articleId":"6422663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6422693,"authors":[{"name":"Sun-Kwon Lee","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sun-Kwon Lee","id":"37716964000"},{"name":"Gyu-Hong Kang","affiliation":["Korea Marine Equipment Research Institute, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gyu-Hong Kang","id":"37557008100"},{"name":"Jin Hur","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Hur","id":"37294744800"},{"name":"Byoung-Woo Kim","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byoung-Woo Kim","id":"37594630300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0954-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0953-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0952-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1938-8756"}],"articleNumber":"6422693","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic analysis of 100kW IPM machine for ship anti heeling system considering eccentricity and several operating conditions","abstract":"This paper deals the electromagnetic analysis to investigate the vibration sources of 100kW interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine according to eccentricities considering several operating conditions.

Current measurement noise and quantization necessitate a minimum amount of injection amplitude, which implies an acoustic noise emission that for many applications is unacceptable. This paper proposes to sample the current with the maximum AD conversion frequency while processing the data with an FPGA. By means of a recursive least squares method and a theoretical extension, high precision current slopes are calculated from low injection voltage. Experimental results show that the injection magnitude could be reduced by factor 7 to 10 compared to standard PWM centered current measurement, but also that such weak excitation shifts the HF injection approach to a scale where normally negligible effects have to be taken into consideration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6422797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLED.2012.6422810","publicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives (SLED 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives (SLED 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416126/6422797/06422810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/SLED.2012.6422810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowering injection amplitude in sensorless control by means of current oversampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Lowering injection amplitude in sensorless control by means of current oversampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6422810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286459","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"As originally published there was an error in this document.

In high precision applications, where mm accuracy is crucial, multipath caused errors dominate the total error budget. In this investigation, in a first step, we use the results of a ray-tracing approach in order to characterize the influence of multiple-multipath propagation. The characteristics of the propagation channel, which are estimated by the ray-tracing tool, are used as input for the investigation of the impact of multipath propagation on GNSS observables. In a second step, a closer look on GNSS signal amplitudes will be presented. The model presented in this paper is adopted from wireless network simulations and the signal amplitude of each signal component involved is estimated for each epoch separately based on the geometry and the receiving antenna pattern. The model is validated with a simple geometry controlled experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 6th ESA Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies (Navitec 2012) & European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416130/6423035/06423089.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2012 6th ESA Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies (Navitec 2012) & European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/NAVITEC.2012.6423089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAVITEC.2012.6423089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing approach versus double difference, multipath characterization in a multiple ray scenario","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Navigation Satellite Systems","Receiving antennas","Reflection","Ray tracing","Diffraction","Vectors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","multipath channels","radio networks","ray tracing","receiving antennas","satellite navigation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray-tracing approach","double difference","multiple ray scenario","positioning accuracy","multiple-multipath propagation","propagation channel","GNSS observables","signal amplitudes","wireless network simulations","signal component","geometry","receiving antenna pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multipath propagation","ray-tracing","GNSS signal amplitude modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing approach versus double difference, multipath characterization in a multiple ray scenario","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423089/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271835","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing approach versus double difference, multipath characterization in a multiple ray scenario","confLoc":"Noordwijk, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"2587329SMYRNAIOS.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145977S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416130","isNumber":"6423035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416130","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6423035","articleId":"6423089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423091,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando D.

Our experimental results show that AMP achieves 20% improvement on program performance due to the reduction of the number of verify executions by 39% in 3-bit/cell architecture NAND flash memory of 21 nm CMOS technology.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6484888/06423217.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multi-Pulse Program Scheme Based on Tunneling Speed Classification for Next Generation Multi-Bit/Cell NAND FLASH","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2237974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6484888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2237974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multi-Pulse Program Scheme Based on Tunneling Speed Classification for Next Generation Multi-Bit/Cell NAND FLASH","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13396692","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6423217/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multi-Pulse Program Scheme Based on Tunneling Speed Classification for Next Generation Multi-Bit/Cell NAND FLASH","sourcePdf":"jssc-cho-2237974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06286S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6484888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6484888","articleId":"6423217","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423218,"authors":[{"name":"Xicheng Jiang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6484888/6423218/6423218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xicheng Jiang received the B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1991 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from University of California, Los Angeles, CA, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.","Since 1997, he has been with Analog and RF microelectronics group at Broadcom, where he is currently a Broadcom Distinguished Engineer and the senior manager, IC design engineering.

Recently, we introduced a new UHF RFID tag localization technique. The proposed method is based on phase measurements taken along a synthetic aperture. A holographic image is calculated based on the scanned phase values. The image represents the spatial probability density function for the actual tag location. This paper presents this innovative method in detail. Simulations that illustrate the effect of the given trajectory are included. Extensive measurements obtained in a reflective lab environment are presented. We discuss the method's effectiveness with respect to measurement errors, antenna phase center distortions, and the available phase information. The results show the potential practical applications for the method in moving reader antennas, such as handheld readers or readers mounted on vehicles like forklifts or mobile robotic systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UHF RFID Localization Based on Synthetic Apertures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2012.2224656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6549150/06423221.pdf","startPage":"807","endPage":"815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2012.2224656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"UHF RFID Localization Based on Synthetic Apertures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6423221/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13599287","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UHF RFID Localization Based on Synthetic Apertures","sourcePdf":"tase-miesen-2224656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068951S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6549150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6549150","articleId":"6423221","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423222,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Collado","affiliation":["Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6567958/6423222/6423222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ana Collado (M'07) was born in Santander, Spain.

Due to variation of the available sunlight intensity, the battery voltage and load condition, the system's structures and operating modes are switched from time to time. The dynamic behavior is thus quite complex, and the design for stable operation of the system requires consideration of the stability conditions for all possible operating modes. This paper studies the dynamic behavior of this system and reveals the smooth and non-smooth bifurcation phenomena. Under certain conditions, when the system switches its operating mode, a non-smooth bifurcation, manifested as a jump from stable to unstable behavior, has been observed and verified with full-circuit simulations. Moreover, a detailed analysis based on averaged modes is performed to identify the two types of bifurcation and evaluate the stability boundaries of the system. The results provide useful insights and information about the behavior of the system and the interacting effects of control parameters on the design of the control loops.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239140","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6507572/06423224.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bifurcation Analysis of Standalone Photovoltaic-Battery Hybrid Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Bifurcation Analysis of Standalone Photovoltaic-Battery Hybrid Power System","volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","accessionNumber":"14159168","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423224/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bifurcation Analysis of Standalone Photovoltaic-Battery Hybrid Power System","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tse-2239140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102524S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6507572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6507572","articleId":"6423224","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6423238,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Miranian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University of Iran, Mashhad, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6563116/6423238/6423238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Miranian was born in Mashhad, Iran, in 1983.

This issue is formulated as a power dispatching problem between distributed power sources with the objective of grid operational cost minimization. Under the assumption of time-varying demands and supplies at individual microgrids, a cooperative power dispatching algorithm of interactions among microgrids is proposed for power sharing within the grid. This is done through a communication infrastructure in the grid and a set of defined parameters known as purchase prices at individual microgrids. As a result of this algorithm, power flows within the grid are regulated to smooth power generations at microgrids despite the stochastic load demands. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed load management scheme in comparison with no power sharing scheme in the grid operational cost point of view. Moreover, optimal solution of the power problem verifies these results.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2012.2232945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2012.2232945","startPage":"586","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/6542007/06423249.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Cooperative Power Dispatching in Interconnected Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Cooperative Power Dispatching in Interconnected Microgrids","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13583123","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423249/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Cooperative Power Dispatching in Interconnected Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tste-fathi-2232945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050354S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6542007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6542007","articleId":"6423249","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6423250,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The losses due to partial shading are not proportional to the shaded area but depend on the shading pattern, array configuration and the physical location of shaded modules in the array. This paper presents a technique to configure the modules in the array so as to enhance the generated power from the array under partial shading conditions. In this approach, the physical location of the modules in a Total Cross Tied (TCT) connected PV array are arranged based on the Su Do Ku puzzle pattern so as to distribute the shading effect over the entire array. Further, this arrangement of modules is done without altering the electrical connection of the modules in the array. The Su Do Ku arrangement reduces the effect of shading of modules in any row thereby enhancing the generated PV power. The performance of the system is investigated for different shading patterns and the results show that positioning the modules of the array according to \u201cSu Do Ku\u201d puzzle pattern yields improved performance under partially shaded

They are based on compressive sensing (CS) theory, which allows finding sparse signal representations in underdetermined linear equation systems. In particular, two common CS solutions are adopted for our reconstruction problem: the basis pursuit and the orthogonal matching pursuit methods. A novel alternative CS solution is also proposed through a formulation within a multiobjective genetic optimization scheme. To illustrate the performances of the proposed methods, a thorough experimental analysis on FORMOsa SATellite-2 and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-5 multispectral images is reported and discussed. It includes a detailed simulation study that aims at assessing the accuracy of the methods in different qualitative and quantitative cloud-contamination conditions. Compared with state-of-the-art techniques for cloud removal, the proposed methods show a clear superiority, which makes them a promising tool in cleaning images in the presence of clouds.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6544631/06423277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544631","startPage":"3998","endPage":"4008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Missing-Area Reconstruction in Multispectral Images Under a Compressive Sensing Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Missing-Area Reconstruction in Multispectral Images Under a Compressive Sensing Perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13583267","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Missing-Area Reconstruction in Multispectral Images Under a Compressive Sensing Perspective","sourcePdf":"tgrs-melgani-2227329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097421S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6544631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6544631","articleId":"6423277","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6423278,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Le Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6544631/6423278/6423278-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xi-Le Zhao received the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Mathematical Sciences.","In 2012, he was an exchange Ph.D. student at Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.

SAR image categorization requires the generation of a compact feature descriptor that accurately defines the content of the image patch under consideration. As phase information plays a critical role in SAR images, this paper proposes the use of a chirplet-derived transform, i.e., the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), for generating a compact feature descriptor for single-look complex (SLC) SAR images. Representing a SAR signal in rotated joint time-frequency planes via the FrFT allows discovering the underlying backscattering phenomenon of the objects on the ground. SAR image projections on different planes of the joint time-frequency space using the FrFT provide a simple statistical response that is easier to analyze. The proposed method has been compared with a multiscale approach, i.e., Gabor filter banks, a second-order-statistics-based method (as gray-level co-occurrence matrices), and a spectral descriptor method. We demonstrate the suitability of the FrFT-based method for image categorization on the basis of backscattering behavior, whereas the Gabor-filter-bank-based method is found mainly suitable for images with a strong texture. This paper demonstrates enhancement in the separability for most of the considered categories when using logarithmic cumulants instead of linear moments for both the FrFT-based and Gabor-filter-bank-based methods. The experimental database consists of 2000 image patches (of size 200 \u00d7 200 pixels) extracted from SLC HR TerraSAR-X scenes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Image Categorization With Log Cumulants of the Fractional Fourier Transform Coefficients","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6661404/06423280.pdf","startPage":"5273","endPage":"5282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661404","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"SAR Image Categorization With Log Cumulants of the Fractional Fourier Transform Coefficients","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6423280/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Image Categorization With Log Cumulants of the Fractional Fourier Transform Coefficients","sourcePdf":"tgrs-singh-2230892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136232S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6661404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6661404","articleId":"6423280","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423283,"authors":[{"name":"Bobak Nazer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bobak Nazer (S\u203202\u2013M\u203209) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2003, the M.S. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, in 2005, and the Ph.D degree from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, in 2009, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University, Boston, MA.

These gates are realized using primitive quantum operations that are supported by a quantum physical machine description (PMD). Since different quantum systems are associated with different Hamiltonians, a specific quantum operation may be more easily realizable in one quantum system than another. Thus, different quantum systems have different PMDs. Also, the quantum cost for implementing a quantum operation may differ from one PMD to another. Thus, a quantum logic circuit needs to be realized with and optimized for only the set of primitive quantum operations supported by the given PMD. Quantum logic design that can be targeted at multiple PMDs has not been attempted before, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we target quantum logic design with respect to the set of primitive quantum operations that are supported by six different PMDs: quantum dot, superconducting, ion trap, neutral atom, and two photonics systems. Our aim is to build a quantum gate library that targets these PMDs. This is akin to a cell library in traditional logic design that enables logic gates to be mapped to cells realizable in an underlying technology. To make our quantum gate library efficient in terms of the number of primitive quantum operations involved and the associated delay, we explore one- and two-qubit quantum identity rules that can help remove redundancies in the quantum gate implementation. We show that, using these identities, each gate in the library can be efficiently mapped to just the set of primitive operations supported by each of the six PMDs. Each mapping results in a different circuit structure and quantum cost, which is measured in terms of the number of primitive quantum operations and the number of execution cycles required. Thus, such a library provides the foundation for quantum logic synthesis, just like a cell library provides the foundation for technology-dependent logic synthesis (i.e., technology mapping) in traditional synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2227518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6606858/06423291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2227518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606858","startPage":"2055","endPage":"2068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Quantum Gate Library for Various Physical Machine Descriptions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Quantum Gate Library for Various Physical Machine Descriptions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13795471","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Quantum Gate Library for Various Physical Machine Descriptions","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lin-2227518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099576S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6606858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6606858","articleId":"6423291","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423303,"authors":[{"name":"Mahnaz Arvaneh","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6462010/6423303/6423303-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahnaz Arvaneh (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from K.

Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions often lead to deteriorated BCI performances, as features extracted by methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant against the changes. To extract features that are robust and invariant, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm called Kullback-Leibler (KL) CSP. The CSP algorithm only considers the discrimination between the means of the classes, but does not consider within-class scatters information. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities measured by a loss function based on the KL divergence. The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is compared against two existing algorithms, CSP and stationary CSP (sCSP), using the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa and a large dataset from stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation. The results show that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperforms both the CSP and the sCSP algorithms, in terms of classification accuracy, by reducing within-class variations. This results in more compact and separable features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13324044","pubMedId":"24808381","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6423303/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Spatial Filters by Minimizing Within-Class Dissimilarities in Electroencephalogram-Based Brain\u2013Computer Interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Spatial Filters by Minimizing Within-Class Dissimilarities in Electroencephalogram-Based Brain\u2013Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tnnls-arvaneh-2239310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129372S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6462010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6462010","articleId":"6423303","onlineDate":"29 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423452,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Pan","affiliation":["IFlytek Research, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Pan","id":"38546958600"},{"name":"Cong Liu","affiliation":["IFlytek Research, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38559904400"},{"name":"Zhiguo Wang","affiliation":["IFlytek Research, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37655597500"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["IFlytek Research, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37420506100"},{"name":"Hui Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272625700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2507-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2506-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2505-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6423452","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":917},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Switches","Training","Context","Speech recognition","Vectors","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","speech recognition","vectors","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","GMMS","context-dependent deep neural network","ASR tasks","switchboard task","relative error reduction","discriminatively trained GMM","training data","speech frames","DNN input feature vectors","logarithm spectrum features","VTLN normalized features","acoustic modeling","Gaussian mixture models","automatic speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","deep neural networks","pre-training","acoustic modeling"]}],"abstract":"Recently, it has been reported that context-dependent deep neural network (DNN) has achieved some unprecedented gains in many challenging ASR tasks, including the well-known Switchboard task. In this paper, we first investigate DNN for several large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. Our results have confirmed that DNN can consistently achieve about 25-30% relative error reduction over the best discriminatively trained GMMs even in some ASR tasks with up to 700 hours of training data. Next, we have conducted a series of experiments to study where the unprecedented gain of DNN comes from. Our experiments show the gain of DNN is almost entirely attributed to DNN's feature vectors that are concatenated from several consecutive speech frames within a relatively long context window. At last, we have proposed a few ideas to reconfigure the DNN input features, such as using logarithm spectrum features or VTLN normalized features in DNN. Our results have shown that each of these methods yields over 3% relative error reduction over the traditional MFCC or PLP features in DNN.","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415467/6423451/06423452.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of deep neural networks (DNN) for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition: Why DNN surpasses GMMS in acoustic modeling","doi":"10.1109/ISCSLP.2012.6423452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSLP.2012.6423452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of deep neural networks (DNN) for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition: Why DNN surpasses GMMS in acoustic modeling","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285857","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6423452/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of deep neural networks (DNN) for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition: Why DNN surpasses GMMS in acoustic modeling","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061788S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415467","isNumber":"6423451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415467","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6423451","articleId":"6423452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423455,"authors":[{"name":"Su Jun Leow","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Su Jun","lastName":"Leow","id":"38548345000"},{"name":"Tze Siong Lau","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tze Siong","lastName":"Lau","id":"38546887900"},{"name":"Alvina Goh","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Alvina","lastName":"Goh","id":"37064193000"},{"name":"Han Meng Peh","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Han Meng","lastName":"Peh","id":"38547651200"},{"name":"Teck Khim Ng","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Teck Khim","lastName":"Ng","id":"38548753700"},{"name":"Sabato Marco Siniscalchi","affiliation":["Kore University of Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Sabato Marco","lastName":"Siniscalchi","id":"37267054000"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2507-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2506-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2505-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6423455","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Artificial neural networks","Acoustics","Databases","Acoustic measurements","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","hidden Markov models","neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","artificial neural network","keyword spotting","acoustic keyword spotter","verification stage","keyword detection","phoneme model","false alarm reduction","ANN-based confidence","HMM-based confidence measure","Mandarin database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic keyword spotting","Confidence measures","Artificial Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an acoustic keyword spotter that operates in two stages, detection and verification.

An SE-HMM is a multi-path HMM in which each path is an HMM constructed from the training data of a different speaker. SE-HMM may be considered a form of template-based acoustic model where speaker-specific acoustic templates are compressed statistically into speaker-specific HMMs. However, one has the flexibility of building SE-HMM at various level of compression: SE-HMM may be built for a triphone state, a triphone, a whole utterance, or other convenient phonetic units. As a result, SE-HMM contains more details than conventional HMM, but is much smaller than common template-based acoustic models. Furthermore, the construction of SE-HMM is simple, and since it is still an HMM, its construction and computation is well supported by common HMM toolkits such as HTK. The proposed SE-HMM was evaluated on Resource Management and Wall Street Journal tasks, and it consistently gives better word recognition results than conventional HMM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-ensemble hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","publicationTitle":"2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISCSLP.2012.6423532","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415467/6423451/06423532.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSLP.2012.6423532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-ensemble hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423532/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285936","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-ensemble hidden Markov modeling for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070409S","chronDate":"5-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415467","isNumber":"6423451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415467","xplore-issue":"6423451","articleId":"6423532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423611,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Samteladze","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Samteladze","id":"38547420300"},{"name":"Ken Christensen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37279370200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423611","dbTime":"48 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423611","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Encoding","Servers","Google","Software","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DELTA framework","delta encoding algorithm","applications","Android Market","app update","smart phone","network traffic","bsdiff tool","bspatch tool","cost savings","energy savings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["green networks","Android app updates","delta encoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423611","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423611.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DELTA: Delta encoding for less traffic for apps","abstract":"The number of applications (or apps) in the Android Market exceeded 450,000 in 2012 with more than 11 billion total downloads.

We show that app update traffic can be reduced by about 50%, this can lead to significant cost and energy savings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423611/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13272220","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423611/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"DELTA: Delta encoding for less traffic for apps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DELTA: Delta encoding for less traffic for apps","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p212samteladze.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067785S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423617,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Hao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Hao","id":"37950014000"},{"name":"Atsushi Iwasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Iwasaki","id":"37284924500"},{"name":"Makoto Yokoo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Yokoo","id":"38546918000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423617","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Pricing","Games","Real-time systems","Analytical models","Optimized production technology","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","pricing","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential game theoretic model","real-time spectrum pricing","cognitive radio networks","spectrum trading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","Spectrum trading","Demand and pricing","Differential game","Nash equilibrium"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A differential game theoretic model for real-time spectrum pricing in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423617","startPage":"236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423617","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, one key feature of spectrum trading is its short term or, even, real time, since the spectrum availability, quality, and price keep changing over time. Therefore, a spectrum pricing policy should be dynamically optimal. In this work, we address the real-time optimal pricing problem for primary users. Based on differential game model, we analyze the optimal pricing strategy for QoS-aware dynamic networks in which the secondary users' number and primary users' QoS level keep changing over time. Nash equilibrium is derived and an optimal pricing and QoS setting policy is formulated. Since the Nash equilibrium of our differential game based model deals with optimal pricing in each time instance, the real-time optimal pricing characteristic can be realized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272226","htmlLink":"/document/6423617/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A differential game theoretic model for real-time spectrum pricing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A differential game theoretic model for real-time spectrum pricing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p236hao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07853S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6423635,"authors":[{"name":"David Riley","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Riley","id":"38548593500"},{"name":"Mohamed Younis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Younis","id":"37285340100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423635","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423635","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Computer architecture","Power demand","Prototypes","Central Processing Unit","Wireless communication","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peripheral interfaces","power distribution","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor nodes","modular architecture","power-intelligent architecture","University of California","Berkeley","dynamic power management","deep system configurability","autonomous peripheral modules","multiple CPU architectures","power sourcing","power distribution","configurable sensor node","CoSeN architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Node","Power Management","Modular and Configurable Design"]}],"abstract":"The current state of the art in wireless sensor nodes, both in academia and industry, is a fractured landscape of designs mostly addressing individual problems. The most common commercial design derives directly from a mote developed at the University of California, Berkeley around 1999, and presents only moderate, incremental improvements over the original design. No designs yet present a comprehensive, intelligent solution befitting a modern system. By using dynamic power management, deep system configurability, autonomous peripheral modules, and multiple CPU architectures, this paper presents a flexible and efficient node architecture. Modules on a sensor node communicate with each other to coordinate their activities and power levels. Special attention is given to power sourcing and distribution. The platform may be configured to efficiently work with most networks, sensor types and power sources due to its improved connectivity and hierarchical design. The resulting Configurable Sensor Node (CoSeN) architecture is competitive with existing designs on price, size and power while greatly exceeding most of them on performance, configurability and application potential. CoSeN is validated through prototype implementation.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423635","startPage":"304","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423635","endPage":"307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modular and power-intelligent architecture for wireless sensor nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A modular and power-intelligent architecture for wireless sensor nodes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423635/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13272239","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modular and power-intelligent architecture for wireless sensor nodes","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p304riley.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037365S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423642,"authors":[{"name":"Ioan Sorin Comsa","affiliation":["Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Sorin Comsa","id":"38548099800"},{"name":"Sijing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Sijing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38238864500"},{"name":"Mehmet Aydin","affiliation":["Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Aydin","id":"37576069400"},{"name":"Pierre Kuonen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Kuonen","id":"37299789100"},{"name":"Jean-Frederic Wagen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Frederic","lastName":"Wagen","id":"37344265400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423642","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Dynamic scheduling","Neural networks","Scheduling algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Optimal scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","Long Term Evolution","neural nets","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic Q-learning","scheduler technique","LTE-advanced technology","neural network","system capacity","user fairness","resource allocation","static threshold value","flexible throughput-fairness tradeoff","channel quality indicator","CQI","transmission time interval","TTI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-Advanced","TTI","CQI","throughput","fairness","scheduling rule","policy","Q-learning","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423642","abstract":"The tradeoff concept between system capacity and user fairness attracts a big interest in LTE-Advanced resource allocation strategies.

This paper proposes a novel dynamic neural Q-learning-based scheduling technique that achieves a flexible throughput-fairness tradeoff by offering optimal solutions according to the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) for different classes of users. The Q-learning algorithm is used to adopt different policies of scheduling rules, at each Transmission Time Interval (TTI). The novel scheduling technique makes use of neural networks in order to estimate proper scheduling rules for different states which have not been explored yet.

Depending on the transmission goals and choice of network parameters, certain noteworthy benefits arise from beamforming.

We present a distributed cross-layer cooperative beamforming protocol implemented into the IEEE 802.11 wireless communication stack: Distributed Decode and Forward Beamforming. In this paper we conduct a brief literature review of current beamforming research, and present a detailed discussion on the mathematical foundation of the single- and multi-destination decode and forward beamforming technique. We then describe our distributed multi-destination decode and forward beamforming protocol, and present results from our in-depth evaluation of our protocol in a realistic simulation environment. In our evaluation, we investigate five aspects of our distributed beamforming protocol: beamforming event frequency, queue length, latency, participation level, and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423658","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423658.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423658","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","startPage":"436","endPage":"444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Decode and Forward Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Decode and Forward Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423658/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423658/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272260","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Decode and Forward Beamforming","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p436walsh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075923S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423659,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"lastName":"Xin Zhao","id":"37293146700"},{"name":"Sanjay Jha","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Jha","id":"37279267200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423659","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Programming","OFDM","Bandwidth","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","geometric programming","greedy algorithms","heuristic programming","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast network","OFDMA based wireless network","subcarrier allocation","channel diversity","optimisation problem","NP-hardness problem","FRAGP","flexible resource allocation with geometric programming","two-step heuristic programming","greedy algorithm","power distribution assumption"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies an efficient resource allocation scheme for multicast in OFDMA based wireless networks. Apart from the conventional resource allocation schemes for multicast which allocate exactly the same subcarriers to the users in a multicast group, this paper proposes a more flexible scheme to divide the multicast group members into different subgroups by utilising the diversity of channel coefficient of different users. We first formulate an optimisation problem to maximise the overall transmission rate. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we design a low-complexity heuristic, Flexible Resource Allocation with Geometric programming (FRAG). FRAG is a two-step heuristic to subdivide the multicast groups and allocate resource to corresponding subgroups. In the first step, we propose a greedy algorithm to subdivide groups and allocate subcarriers given the assumption of even power distribution. Then we use geometric programming (GP) to solve the optimal power allocation problem. Numerical results show that FRAG is able to allocate subcarriers and power efficiently and effectively, and it achieves up to 33% improvement in aggregated throughput.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423659","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423659.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible resource allocation for multicast in OFDMA based wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423659/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible resource allocation for multicast in OFDMA based wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272261","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423659/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible resource allocation for multicast in OFDMA based wireless networks","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p445zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050509S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423666,"authors":[{"name":"Mohan Gurusamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mohan","lastName":"Gurusamy","id":"37270124300"},{"name":"Tho Ngoc Le","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tho Ngoc Le","id":"38546736400"},{"name":"Dinil Mon Divakaran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dinil Mon","lastName":"Divakaran","id":"37304385600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423666","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Servers","Resource management","Complexity theory","Vectors","Aggregates","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated resource allocation scheme","multitenant data center","server resource","network resource","three phase mechanism","load balancing allocator","bandwidth requirement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-center","resources","bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"The success of multi-tenant data-centers depends on the ability to provide performance guarantees in terms of the resources provisioned to the tenants. As bandwidth is shared in a best-effort way in today's data-centers, traffic generated between a set of VMs affect the traffic between another set of VMs sharing the same physical links. This paper proposes an integrated resource allocation scheme that considers not only server-resources, but also network-resource, to decide the mapping of VMs onto servers. We present a three-phase mechanism that finds the right set of servers for the requested VMs, with an aim of reducing the bandwidth on shared links. This mechanism provisions the required bandwidth for the tenants, besides increasing the number of tenants that can cohabit in a data-center. We demonstrate, using simulations, that the proposed scheme accommodates 10%-23% more requests in comparison to a load-balancing allocator that does not consider bandwidth requirements of VMs.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423666","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","startPage":"496","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated resource allocation scheme for multi-tenant data-center","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An integrated resource allocation scheme for multi-tenant data-center","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423666/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272266","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423666/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated resource allocation scheme for multi-tenant data-center","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p496gurusamy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056461S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423671,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Iturralde","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Iturralde","id":"38229578800"},{"name":"Tara Ali Yahiya","affiliation":["LRI, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud 11, France"],"firstName":"Tara Ali","lastName":"Yahiya","id":"37294719900"},{"name":"Anne Wei","affiliation":["Laboratoire C\u00e9dric, CNAM, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Wei","id":"37286387700"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9-Luc Beylot","affiliation":["IRIT/ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9-Luc","lastName":"Beylot","id":"37294719000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1564-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1565-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1563-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6423671","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Games","Resource management","Quality of service","Real-time systems","Bandwidth","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","femtocellular radio","game theory","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE networks","femtocell scenarios","real-time services performance","femtocell interference mitigation","quality of service","multimedia services performance","four-coloring method","cooperative game theory","bitrate application","basic metrics","packet loss ratio","signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio","video applications","VoIP applications","QoS constraints","resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","quality of service","long term evolution","cooperative game theory","shapley value","femtocell"]}],"abstract":"In order to enhance the Quality of Service in LTE, femtocell architecture has been proposed as a promising solution.

Belief propagation (BP) holds great potential for forming an essential and powerful underlying mechanism for such distributed inferences in WSNs. However, it has been recognized that many challenges exist in the context of WSN distributed inference. One such challenge is how to systematically develop a graphical model of WSN, upon which BP-based distributed inference can be effectively and efficiently performed, rather than ad hoc. This paper investigates this challenge and proposes a general and rigorous data-driven approach to building a solid and practical graphical model of WSN, given prior observations, based on graphical model optimization. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using real-world sensor network data. We show that our approach can significantly reduce the energy consumption in BP-based distributed inference in WSNs and also improve the inference accuracy, when compared to the current practice of distributed inference in WSNs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423674","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423674.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"558","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inference in wireless sensor networks based on information structure optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Inference in wireless sensor networks based on information structure optimization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6423674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285586","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423674/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inference in wireless sensor networks based on information structure optimization","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p551zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065942S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6423686,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael M.

These radios access the spectrum in an opportunistic manner in order to take advantage of frequency bands, i.e. channels, left unused by primary users while not interfering with them. This opportunistic access model requires CRs to switch among channels searching for new opportunities and making contact with their neighbors to exchange the information needed for spectrum management. This search process, known as rendezvous (RV), is termed blind RV when it does not use a common control channel (CCC) or a centralized solution. Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the blind RV problem. However, most of them do not deal with broadcast transmissions, that is, when a CR wants to exchange information with all its neighboring nodes. This paper proposes a broadcast mechanism that operates on top of different one-to-one RV algorithms but being agnostic to the one in use, i.e., any such mechanism can be combined with it. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism achieves a favorable performance while inheriting the good properties of the underlying one-to-one RV algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423686","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423686.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423686","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","startPage":"643","endPage":"650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Agnostic broadcast rendezvous for cognitive radio networks using channel hopping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Agnostic broadcast rendezvous for cognitive radio networks using channel hopping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423686/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272281","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Agnostic broadcast rendezvous for cognitive radio networks using channel hopping","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p643guedes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051468S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6423689,"authors":[{"name":"Cyriac James","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Cyriac","lastName":"James","id":"37971383700"},{"name":"Hema A.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling non-stationary and stationary components in long range network time series in the context of anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6413535/6423567/06423689.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling non-stationary and stationary components in long range network time series in the context of anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423689/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272283","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling non-stationary and stationary components in long range network time series in the context of anomaly detection","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p76james.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097093S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6413535","isNumber":"6423567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6413535","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6423567","articleId":"6423689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6423755,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Lafata","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Lafata","id":"37892144500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6423755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Crosstalk and especially far-end crosstalk (FEXT) represents the most serious source of disturbance in today's digital transmission systems. It mostly limits the information capacity of current xDSL digital subscriber lines and local data networks with unshielded or shielded twisted pairs. The elimination of FEXT will require implementation of advanced methods for its modeling to obtain required predictions of its behavior. The standard FEXT model and ITU-T model gives only average results based on the sum of crosstalk in the entire cable, which is usually sufficient in case of summarizing FEXT contributions. However, the implementation of VDMT modulation would require individual modeling of FEXT crosstalk between all subscriber lines in a cable. That is why a new method for modeling of FEXT was developed and is presented here. The results of the model are also compared with measured characteristics for a typical UTP cable and several other cables. The proposed advanced FEXT model with minor modifications is applicable for any metallic cable to provide realistic FEXT characteristics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Power cables","Length measurement","Standards","Frequency measurement","Modulation","Attenuation measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","digital subscriber lines","modulation","twisted pair cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["far-end crosstalk","FEXT","digital transmission system","information capacity","local data network","current xDSL digital subscriber line","shielded twisted pair","unshielded twisted pair","ITU-T model","VDMT modulation","UTP metallic cable"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crosstalk","modeling","transmission lines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.121955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06423755.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.121955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic Modeling of Far-End Crosstalk in Metallic Cables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Realistic Modeling of Far-End Crosstalk in Metallic Cables","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423755/","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423755/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13401528","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic Modeling of Far-End Crosstalk in Metallic Cables","sourcePdf":"435-cl1303-lafata.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039278S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6423755","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423760,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jian","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jian","id":"38566246400"},{"name":"Xiaoping Zeng","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoping","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38231877200"},{"name":"Yunjian Jia","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Yunjian","lastName":"Jia","id":"38579314500"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38563997100"},{"name":"Yuan He","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"He","id":"38579584700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6423760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1051},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423760","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Numerical models","Equations","Analytical models","Shape","Servers","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","queueing theory","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Beta/M/1 queue model","machine type communication","MTC traffic","interarrival time distribution","beta distribution","moment generation function","integral shape parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["G/M/1 queue model","beta distribution","Machine Type Communication"]}],"abstract":"In context of Machine Type Communication (MTC) applications, network has to face increased load as well as possible surges of MTC traffic due to massive concurrent data and signaling transmission, in which case the interarrival time distribution of MTC devices may follow Beta distribution.

The conclusions drawn from numerical analysis can be used as a preliminary guide to appropriately choose the model for different MTC application scenarios and promptly judge the effectiveness of the chosen model.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.122637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.122637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06423760.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beta/M/1 Model for Machine Type Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Beta/M/1 Model for Machine Type Communication","volume":"17","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13401533","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beta/M/1 Model for Machine Type Communication","sourcePdf":"584-cl1303-jian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0606S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6423760","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423761,"authors":[{"name":"Rakshith Rajashekar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, India"],"firstName":"Rakshith","lastName":"Rajashekar","id":"38232822300"},{"name":"K.V.S.

An SC system is constructed by one-dimensional coupling of many subsystems, which are classified into training and propagation parts. An irregular structure is introduced into the subsystems in the training part so that information in that part can be detected successfully. The obtained reliable information may spread over the whole system via the subsystems in the propagation part. In order to allow the subsystems in the training part to collaborate, em shortcuts between them are created to accelerate iterative detection for that part. As an example of SC systems, SC code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems are considered. Density Evolution for the SC CDMA systems shows that the proposed method can provide a significant reduction in the number of iterations for highly loaded systems.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.122769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.012213.122769","startPage":"451","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6481524/06423763.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6481524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Iterative Detection for Spatially Coupled Systems by Collaborative Training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Iterative Detection for Spatially Coupled Systems by Collaborative Training","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423763/","accessionNumber":"13401536","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423763/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Iterative Detection for Spatially Coupled Systems by Collaborative Training","sourcePdf":"451-cl1303-keigo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048243S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6481524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6481524","articleId":"6423763","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6423780,"authors":[{"name":"Gino Giusi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Chimica e Ingegneria Industriale, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Messina, Messina, Italy"],"firstName":"Gino","lastName":"Giusi","id":"37273874300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Iannaccone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Iannaccone","id":"37277082900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6423780","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":912},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Junctions","Logic gates","Semiconductor process modeling","Solid modeling","Doping","Random access memory","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["junction engineering","one transistor dynamic random access memories","one transistor/one capacitor DRAM","reproducible operation","double gate MOSFET device","Shockley Read Hall recombination","band to band tunneling","source/drain junction","statistical device simulation","process variability","junctionless transistor operation","1T DRAM","random dopants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band-to-band tunneling (BTBT)","junctionless (JL)","one-transistor dynamic random access memory (1T-DRAM)","random dopant fluctuation","trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)"]}],"abstract":"One-transistor dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) (1T-DRAMs) are considered a promising candidate to overcome the limits of scalability of conventional one-transistor/one-capacitor DRAMs. Robust and reproducible operation has been demonstrated by experiments in MOSFET devices with a gate length (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n) down to ~50 nm, which prevents their use in future technological nodes.

In this letter, we show through statistical device simulations on a template double-gate MOSFET that, by introducing an underlap of ~16 nm between the drain (source) junction and the gate, it is possible to reduce both the electric field at the junction and the impact of process variability, achieving 1T-DRAMs with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n = 10 nm with a retention time in excess of 100 ms.

The proposed description confirms that conduction in LRS is ohmic (after forming with a sufficiently high current compliance) and is consistent with the earlier description of HRS resistance as controlled by a trap-assisted electron transfer via traps in the oxidized portion of the filament. The length of the nonohmic part of the filament is found to be directly proportional to reset voltage.

These targets generally cannot be identified by visual inspection or prior knowledge, but yet provide crucial and vital information for data exploitation. One such type of targets is anomalies which have recently received considerable interest in hyperspectral image analysis. Many anomaly detectors have been developed and most of them are based on the most widely used Reed-Yu's algorithm, called RX detector (RXD). However, a key issue in making RX detector-like anomaly detectors effective is how to effectively utilize the spectral information provided by data samples, e.g., sample covariance matrix used by RXD. Recently, a dual window-based eigen separation transform (DWEST) was developed to address this issue. This paper extends the concept of DWEST to develop a new approach, to be called multiple-window anomaly detection (MWAD) by making use of multiple windows to perform anomaly detection adaptively. As a result, MWAD is able to detect anomalies of various sizes using multiple windows so that local spectral variations can be characterized and extracted by different window sizes. By virtue of this newly developed MWAD, many existing RXD-like anomaly detectors including DWEST can be derived as special cases of MWAD.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2239959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6516025/06423807.pdf","startPage":"644","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2239959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Window Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423807/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Window Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13499722","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423807/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Window Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-chang-2239959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068848S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6516025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6516025","articleId":"6423807","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423812,"authors":[{"name":"Maarten Lont","affiliation":["IMEC-NL, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6567958/6423812/6423812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maarten Lont was born in Steinheim, Germany, in 1983.

The limited receiver performance will deteriorate the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) of the receiver. In this paper we present closed-form output SNR and BER models of a non-ideal receiver front-end with limiter-discriminator demodulator for binary FSK. The presented model is very useful in defining the minimally required receiver specifications. Moreover, the models are useful for gaining insight into the influences of the receiver impairments on its performance. In the models, the gain and phase imbalances between the in-phase and quadrature-phase paths as well as the receiver generated noise and the phase noise produced by the local frequency reference are taken into account. This paper shows that the gain and phase imbalances shift the FM threshold to higher carrier-to-noise-ratios (CNR) and only have small influence on the SNR above threshold. On the other hand, receiver generated noise reduces the output SNR both below and above the FM threshold, and phase noise limits the maximum output SNR. Additionally, a trade-off between the FSK frequency deviation and phase noise robustness is derived.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6567958","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2198","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6567958/06423812.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2239151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implications of I/Q Imbalance, Phase Noise and Noise Figure for SNR and BER of FSK Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Receivers","Phase noise","Signal to noise ratio","Demodulation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","error statistics","frequency shift keying","phase noise","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise robustness","FSK frequency deviation","CNR","carrier-to-noise-ratio","FM threshold","local frequency reference","receiver generated noise","in-phase path","quadrature-phase paths","receiver impairments","binary FSK","limiter-discriminator demodulator","nonideal receiver front-end","closed-form output SNR","bit-error-rate","output signal-to-noise-ratio","power consumption","BAN receiver performance","body area networks","energy-constrained applications","BER models","FSK receivers","noise figure","I/Q imbalance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","body area networks","click noise","FSK","I/Q imbalance","phase noise","SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Implications of I/Q Imbalance, Phase Noise and Noise Figure for SNR and BER of FSK Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6423812/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13786048","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implications of I/Q Imbalance, Phase Noise and Noise Figure for SNR and BER of FSK Receivers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lont-2239151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07591S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6567958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6567958","articleId":"6423812","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423820,"authors":[{"name":"Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez Astudillo","affiliation":["Spoken Language Systems Laboratory, INESC-ID Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6428687/6423820/6423820-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez Astudillo (M'12) studied Electrical Engineering in the University of Oviedo (Spain) and the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin.

In addition to this, a measure of estimate reliability is also attained which allows either feature re-estimation or the dynamic compensation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The proposed method transforms the posterior distribution associated to a Wiener filter through the feature extraction using the STFT Uncertainty Propagation formulas. It is also shown that non-linear estimators in the STFT domain like the Ephraim-Malah filters can be seen as special cases of a propagation of the Wiener posterior. The method is illustrated by developing two MMSE-Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) estimators and combining them with observation uncertainty techniques. We discuss similarities with other MMSE-MFCC estimators and show how the proposed approach outperforms conventional MMSE estimators in the STFT domain on the AURORA4 robust ASR task.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2244085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2244085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428687","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6428687/06423820.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Speech","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Speech enhancement","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Fourier transforms","least mean squares methods","nonlinear estimation","speech recognition","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STFT domain speech distortion model","MMSE computation","minimum mean square error","feature extraction method","short-time Fourier transform","dynamic compensation","automatic speech recognition","posterior distribution","Wiener filter","STFT uncertainty propagation formula","nonlinear estimator","Ephraim-Malah filter","MMSE-melfrequency cepstral coefficient","MFCC estimator","AURORA4 robust ASR task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMSE","uncertainty decoding","uncertainty propagation","wiener filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computing MMSE Estimates and Residual Uncertainty Directly in the Feature Domain of ASR using STFT Domain Speech Distortion Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423820/","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6423820/","accessionNumber":"13306783","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing MMSE Estimates and Residual Uncertainty Directly in the Feature Domain of ASR using STFT Domain Speech Distortion Models","sourcePdf":"tasl-astudillo-2244085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111835S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6428687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6428687","articleId":"6423820","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423821,"authors":[{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37280868900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"6423821","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8712},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Speech processing","Bayesian methods","Training","Machine learning","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning paradigms","overview","automatic speech recognition","hidden Markov model","machine learning techniques","discriminative learning","structured sequence learning","Bayesian learning","adaptive learning","ASR research","ASR systems","cross-pollination","ASR communities","generative learning","unsupervised learning","semisupervised learning","supervised learning","active learning","multitask learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","speech recognition","super vised","unsupervised","discriminative","generative","dynamics","adaptive","Bayesian","deep learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423821","abstract":"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has historically been a driving force behind many machine learning (ML) techniques, including the ubiquitously used hidden Markov model, discriminative learning, structured sequence learning, Bayesian learning, and adaptive learning. Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications. We finally present and analyze recent developments of deep learning and learning with sparse representations, focusing on their direct relevance to advancing ASR technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6428687/06423821.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2244083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2244083","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Learning Paradigms for Speech Recognition: An Overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423821/","displayDocTitle":"Machine Learning Paradigms for Speech Recognition: An Overview","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"13551585","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Learning Paradigms for Speech Recognition: An Overview","sourcePdf":"tasl-deng-2244083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15285S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6428687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"151","articleId":"6423821","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423838,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Focusing on the GPU memory access patterns, we utilize different kinds of GPU memory according to these patterns in order to maximize the memory cache performance. We also exploit the GPU instruction-level parallelism to efficiently hide long latencies from the memory operations. Our experiments indicate that our GPU implementation of the projection operators has slightly faster or approximately comparable time performance than FFT-based approaches using state-of-the-art FFTW routines.

This simplified approach is motivated by the fact that the SPICE parameters are often not known by the end-user. In this approach, the transient currents induced by primary or secondary ions are calculated in the framework of the diffusion/collection model. Then, they are used to calculate the voltage variation at each node of the cell in which the current of each of the four latch transistors is accounted for and is given by a standard first-order model in which three major regions of operation are modeled (subthreshold, triode and saturation). Presented results are in good agreement with ion/neutron/proton experiment for 150 nm, 90 nm and 65 nm SRAMs. Even if the proposed approach would need further validation, this paper is a first step to give guideline on how calculating SEU cross section based on not detailed technological parameters instead of empirical ones. The strong point of our proposal is that it dynamically accounts for the behavior of the four transistors of refreshing loop in the cell.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2012.2235148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2012.2235148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6579700/06423851.pdf","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6579700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Soft Error Triggering Criterion Based on Simplified Electrical Model of the SRAM Cell","volume":"60","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13706257","htmlLink":"/document/6423851/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Error Triggering Criterion Based on Simplified Electrical Model of the SRAM Cell","sourcePdf":"tns-wrobel-2235148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063898S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6579700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6579700","articleId":"6423851","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423852,"authors":[{"name":"Yihua Yan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yihua","lastName":"Yan","id":"38547790800"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597877000"},{"name":"Ruyu Fan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Ruyu","lastName":"Fan","id":"37400563900"},{"name":"Xiaoqiang Guo","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"38548767300"},{"name":"Hongxia Guo","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hongxia","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085816656"},{"name":"Fengqi Zhang","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Fengqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38547579900"},{"name":"Lili Ding","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085379524"},{"name":"Keying Zhang","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Keying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088612255"},{"name":"Dongsheng Lin","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37590230900"},{"name":"Yuanming Wang","affiliation":["Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Wang","id":"38547599400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6423852","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":611},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Radiation effects","Decoding","Annealing","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Charge pumps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits","NOR circuits","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TID induced failure mode","NOR flash memories","NAND flash memories","ionizing radiation effect","X-ray microbeam test","radiation susceptibility","error distribution","address related signature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Address error","flash memory","functional failure","microbeam","TID"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2012.2234138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6451184/06423852.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2012.2234138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the TID Induced Failure Modes in NOR and NAND Flash Memories","abstract":"The total ionizing radiation effects of several NOR and NAND flash memories under the read only mode are investigated.

This paper investigates two neural network-based methods for direct and rapid construction of prediction intervals (PIs) for short-term forecasting of power generation in wind farms. The lower upper bound estimation and bootstrap methods are used to quantify uncertainties associated with forecasts. The effectiveness and efficiency of these two general methods for uncertainty quantification is examined using twenty four month data from a wind farm in Australia. PIs with a confidence level of 90% are constructed for four forecasting horizons: five, ten, fifteen, and thirty minutes. Quantitative measures are applied for objective evaluation and unbiased comparison of PI quality. Demonstrated results indicate that reliable PIs can be constructed in a short time without resorting to complicate computational methods or models. Also quantitative comparison reveals that bootstrap PIs are more suitable for short prediction horizon, and lower upper bound estimation PIs are more appropriate for longer forecasting horizons.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2012.2232944","startPage":"602","endPage":"610","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/6542007/06423867.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2012.2232944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction Intervals for Short-Term Wind Farm Power Generation Forecasts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Wind farms","Uncertainty","Wind forecasting","Wind power generation","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapping","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system management","statistical analysis","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction intervals","short-term wind farm power generation forecasts","optimal management","power systems","neural network-based methods","lower upper bound estimation","bootstrap methods","uncertainty quantification","PI quality","quantitative measures","objective evaluation","short prediction horizon"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","prediction intervals","uncertainty","wind energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","displayDocTitle":"Prediction Intervals for Short-Term Wind Farm Power Generation Forecasts","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6423867/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13583127","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction Intervals for Short-Term Wind Farm Power Generation Forecasts","sourcePdf":"tste-khosravi-2232944-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100638S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"6542007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6542007","articleId":"6423867","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6423875,"authors":[{"name":"Linlin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Linlin Yang received the Ph.D. degree in industrial and system engineering from the State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, in 2011.","She is currently a Process Engineer with Alta Devices, Santa Clara, CA.

Most accelerated cycling tests are restricted to constant amplitudes, whereas realistic environments usually involve varying amplitudes and/or more than one type of loading. Thus assessments of life as well as relative comparisons of alternatives in terms of life in service invariably have to rely on the assumption of a damage accumulation rule. This paper focuses on the life of SnAgCu solder joints in isothermal mechanical cycling with varying amplitudes. Test samples use representative solder material and geometry in electronic packaging industry. Experimental results show that the load sequence affects life significantly, reflecting deviations from a linear damage accumulation rule. Hardness and microstructure of solder material are studied after cyclic loading. The effect of load sequence could be explained by the damage evolution path and solder property change, which varied with cycling. Moreover, different levels of initial loading lead to changes in acceleration factors in subsequent shear fatigue cycling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423875/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13343070","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Assessment of the Life of SnAgCu Solder Joints in Cycling With Varying Amplitudes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Assessment of the Life of SnAgCu Solder Joints in Cycling With Varying Amplitudes","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-yang-2238234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099963S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6468156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6468156","articleId":"6423875","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423879,"authors":[{"name":"Liangjun Ke","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6670128/6423879/6423879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangjun Ke received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.","From 2011 to 2012, he visited the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Following other MOEA/D-like algorithms, MOEA/D-ACO decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization problems. Each ant (i.e., agent) is responsible for solving one subproblem. All the ants are divided into a few groups, and each ant has several neighboring ants. An ant group maintains a pheromone matrix, and an individual ant has a heuristic information matrix. During the search, each ant also records the best solution found so far for its subproblem. To construct a new solution, an ant combines information from its group's pheromone matrix, its own heuristic information matrix, and its current solution. An ant checks the new solutions constructed by itself and its neighbors, and updates its current solution if it has found a better one in terms of its own objective. Extensive experiments have been conducted in this paper to study and compare MOEA/D-ACO with other algorithms on two sets of test problems. On the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem, MOEA/D-ACO outperforms the MOEA/D with conventional genetic operators and local search on all the nine test instances. We also demonstrate that the heuristic information matrices in MOEA/D-ACO are crucial to the good performance of MOEA/D-ACO for the knapsack problem. On the biobjective traveling salesman problem, MOEA/D-ACO performs much better than the BicriterionAnt on all the 12 test instances. We also evaluate the effects of grouping, neighborhood, and the location information of current solutions on the performance of MOEA/D-ACO. The work in this paper shows that reactive search optimization scheme, i.e., the \u201clearning while optimizing\u201d principle, is effective in improving multiobjective optimization algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914872","pubMedId":"23757576","htmlLink":"/document/6423879/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MOEA/D-ACO: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Decomposition and AntColony","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOEA/D-ACO: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Decomposition and AntColony","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhang-2231860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126679S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6670128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6670128","articleId":"6423879","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423885,"authors":[{"name":"Renzo Recanatini","affiliation":["Centro di Servizi Multimediali ed Informatici, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6627992/6423885/6423885-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renzo Recanatini was born in Ancona, Italy, in 1963.

Supervised hyperspectral image classification is a difficult task due to the unbalance between the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of labeled training samples in real analysis scenarios. While the collection of labeled samples is generally difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, unlabeled samples can be generated in a much easier way. This observation has fostered the idea of adopting semisupervised learning techniques in hyperspectral image classification. The main assumption of such techniques is that the new (unlabeled) training samples can be obtained from a (limited) set of available labeled samples without significant effort/cost. In this paper, we develop a new approach for semisupervised learning which adapts available active learning methods (in which a trained expert actively selects unlabeled samples) to a self-learning framework in which the machine learning algorithm itself selects the most useful and informative unlabeled samples for classification purposes. In this way, the labels of the selected pixels are estimated by the classifier itself, with the advantage that no extra cost is required for labeling the selected pixels using this machine-machine framework when compared with traditional machine-human active learning. The proposed approach is illustrated with two different classifiers: multinomial logistic regression and a probabilistic pixelwise support vector machine. Our experimental results with real hyperspectral images collected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and the Reflective Optics Spectrographic Imaging System indicate that the use of self-learning represents an effective and promising strategy in the context of hyperspectral image classification.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2228275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6544631/06423895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2228275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544631","startPage":"4032","endPage":"4044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semisupervised Self-Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semisupervised Self-Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13583274","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semisupervised Self-Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-plaza-2228275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141537S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6544631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6544631","articleId":"6423895","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6423899,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Cardenas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6472101/6423899/6423899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto C\u00e1rdenas (S'95\u2013M'97\u2013SM'07) was born in Punta Arenas, Chile.

As a matter of fact, an FDD system is a data-processing system on the basis of information redundancy, in which the data and human's understanding of the data are two fundamental elements. Human's understanding may be an explicit input-output model representing the relationship among the system's variables. It may also be represented as knowledge implicitly (e.g., the connection weights of a neural network). Therefore, FDD is done through some kind of modeling, signal processing, and intelligence computation. In this paper, a variety of FDD techniques are reviewed within the unified data-processing framework to give a full picture of FDD and achieve a new level of understanding. According to the types of data and how the data are processed, the FDD methods are classified into three categories: model-based online data-driven methods, signal-based methods, and knowledge-based history data-driven methods. An outlook to the possible evolution of FDD in industrial automation, including the hybrid FDD and the emerging networked FDD, are also presented to reveal the future development direction in this field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","volume":"9","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13843496","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423903/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"From Model, Signal to Knowledge: A Data-Driven Perspective of Fault Detection and Diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Model, Signal to Knowledge: A Data-Driven Perspective of Fault Detection and Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tii-gao-2243743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.256259S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6631519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"311","xplore-issue":"6631519","articleId":"6423903","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6423909,"authors":[{"name":"Shutao Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6515702/6423909/6423909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shutao Li (M'07) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 1995, 1997, and 2001, respectively.

Alongside the theoretical development of these systems, algorithmic realizations of the associated transforms are provided. However, one of the most common shortcomings of these frameworks is the lack of providing a unified treatment of the continuum and digital world, i.e., allowing a digital theory to be a natural digitization of the continuum theory. In this paper, we introduce a new shearlet transform associated with a nonseparable shearlet generator, which improves the directional selectivity of previous shearlet transforms. Our approach is based on a discrete framework, which allows a faithful digitization of the continuum domain directional transform based on compactly supported shearlets introduced as means to sparsely encode anisotropic singularities of multivariate data. We show numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of our new shearlet transform in 2D and 3D image processing applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6477165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2244223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6477165/06423910.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2065","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2244223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonseparable Shearlet Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Nonseparable Shearlet Transform","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6423910/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13387304","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2013","pubMedId":"23372085","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonseparable Shearlet Transform","sourcePdf":"tip-lim-2244223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081243S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6477165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6477165","articleId":"6423910","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6423933,"authors":[{"name":"M.

SVM is a type of learning machine based on statistical learning theory. Many applications require accurate measurement of battery SOC in order to give users an indication of available runtime. It is particularly important for electric vehicles or portable devices. In this paper, the proposed SOC estimator extracts model parameters from battery charging/discharging testing cycles, using cell current, cell voltage, and cell temperature as independent variables. Tests are carried out on a 60 Ah lithium-ion cell with the dynamic stress test cycle to set up the SVM model. The SVM SOC estimator maintains a high level of accuracy, better than 6% over all ranges of operation, whether the battery is charged/discharged at constant current or it is operating in a variable current profile.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6525347/06423937.pdf","startPage":"5919","endPage":"5926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6525347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machines Used to Estimate the Battery State of Charge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Support vector machines","Batteries","Temperature measurement","Accuracy","Current measurement","Discharges (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","iron compounds","lithium compounds","manganese compounds","secondary cells","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machine approach","battery state-of-charge estimation","high-capacity lithium iron manganese phosphate battery cell","SVM approach","learning machine","statistical learning theory","battery SOC measurement accuracy","electric vehicles","portable devices","model parameters","battery charging-discharging testing cycles","cell current","cell voltage","cell temperature","lithium-ion cell","dynamic stress test cycle","SVM SOC estimator","LiFeMnPO4"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lithium batteries","modeling","state of charge (SOC)","support vector machines (SVMs)","support vector regression (SVR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machines Used to Estimate the Battery State of Charge","volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6423937/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13539094","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machines Used to Estimate the Battery State of Charge","sourcePdf":"tpel-alvarezanton-2243918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068404S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6525347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"6525347","articleId":"6423937","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6423938,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwei He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6513254/6423938/6423938-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinwei He (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree from the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.

The proposed method can realize accurate regulation of DG unit equivalent impedance at both fundamental and selected harmonic frequencies. In contrast to conventional virtual impedance control methods, where only a line current feed-forward term is added to the DG voltage reference, the proposed virtual impedance at fundamental and harmonic frequencies is regulated using DG line current and point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feed-forward terms, respectively. With this modification, the impacts of mismatched physical feeder impedances are compensated. Thus, better reactive and harmonic power sharing can be realized. Additionally, this paper also demonstrates that PCC harmonic voltages can be mitigated by reducing the magnitude of DG unit equivalent harmonic impedance. Finally, in order to alleviate the computing load at DG unit local controller, this paper further exploits the band-pass capability of conventionally resonant controllers. With the implementation of proposed resonant controller, accurate power sharing and PCC harmonic voltage compensation are achieved without using any fundamental and harmonic components extractions. Experimental results from a scaled single-phase microgrid prototype are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed virtual impedance control approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6513254/06423938.pdf","startPage":"5272","endPage":"5282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Islanding Microgrid Power Sharing Approach Using Enhanced Virtual Impedance Control Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Islanding Microgrid Power Sharing Approach Using Enhanced Virtual Impedance Control Scheme","volume":"28","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6423938/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13487545","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423938/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Islanding Microgrid Power Sharing Approach Using Enhanced Virtual Impedance Control Scheme","sourcePdf":"tpel-he-2243757-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091137S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6513254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"329","xplore-issue":"6513254","articleId":"6423938","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6423940,"authors":[{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang, Singapore"],"firstName":"Poh Chiang","lastName":"Loh","id":"37275742000"},{"name":"Ding Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Li","id":"37402914000"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6423940","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":202,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3028},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Educational institutions","Boosting","Equivalent circuits","Modulation","Facsimile"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-type \u0393-Z-source inverters","\u0393-shaped impedance network","voltage-buck behavior","modulation ratio","transformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded-Z-source","quasi-Z-source","T-source","trans-Z-source","Z-source","\u0393-Z-source inverters"]}],"abstract":"Voltage-type \u0393-Z-source inverters are proposed in this letter.

The conventional MPDPC achieves good steady-state performance and quick dynamic response by selecting the best voltage vector, which minimizes the errors between the reference power and the real power. However, due to the limited number of voltage vectors in a two-level converter, the sampling frequency has to be high to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper introduces the concept of a duty cycle control in the MPDPC by allocating a fraction of control period for a nonzero voltage vector and the rest time for a zero vector. The nonzero vector is selected by evaluating the effects of each nonzero vector and its duration is obtained based on the principle of power errors minimization. Simulation and experimental results prove that, compared to the conventional MPDPC, the proposed MPDPC with duty cycle achieves further steady-state performance improvement without affecting the dynamic response at a small cost of control complexity increase.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6513254/06423943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513254","startPage":"5343","endPage":"5351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Power Control of a PWM Rectifier With Duty Cycle Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Power Control of a PWM Rectifier With Duty Cycle Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13487548","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6423943/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Direct Power Control of a PWM Rectifier With Duty Cycle Optimization","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2243846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099437S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6513254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"6513254","articleId":"6423943","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6423950,"authors":[{"name":"Byron T.

First, we analyze the behavior of the crossover point of the error probability curves for orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) and spatial multiplexing (SM) with a zero-forcing linear receiver. We mathematically prove that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, for both the information outage probability and the uncoded bit error rate, as data rate increases, the crossover point for the error probability monotonically decreases, and the crossover point for the SNR monotonically increases. We prove that this holds, regardless of the numbers of transmit and receive antennas and the spatial multiplexing rate of OSTBC. We next show how those results can be exploited for the optimal transmission of progressive sources, such as embedded image, which require unequal target error rates in their bitstream. That is, the computational complexity involved with the optimal space-time coding of progressive bitstream can be decreased.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmission of Progressive Sources Based on the Error Probability Analysis of SM and OSTBC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2243851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6710258/06423966.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2243851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6423966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6423966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 January 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transmission of Progressive Sources Based on the Error Probability Analysis of SM and OSTBC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6423966/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14031677","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transmission of Progressive Sources Based on the Error Probability Analysis of SM and OSTBC","sourcePdf":"tvt-chang-2243851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109502S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6710258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6710258","articleId":"6423966","onlineDate":"30 January 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6423967,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6423967/6423967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Chen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009.

This paper uses importance sampling of dynamic failure metrics to quantify and analyze the effect of different assist techniques, array organization, and timing on Vmin at design time. This approach demonstrates that the most effective technique for reducing SRAM Vmin is the negative bitline write assist, resulting in a Vmin of 600 mV for a 28-nm LP process in the typical corner.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2012.2231015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2012.2231015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6424017/06424019.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM Assist Techniques for Operation in a Wide Voltage Range in 28-nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"SRAM Assist Techniques for Operation in a Wide Voltage Range in 28-nm CMOS","volume":"59","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424019/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13270818","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424019/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM Assist Techniques for Operation in a Wide Voltage Range in 28-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsii-zimmer-2231015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08867S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6424017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6424017","articleId":"6424019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6424040,"authors":[{"name":"William S.

We consider a scenario where each node acts as an autonomous agent, maintaining a knowledge base of the network conditions and pursuing its own communication goals. The agents use negotiation to reach agreements about the allocation of network resources and the configuration of forwarding paths. The contribution of this paper is a novel, argumentation based negotiation framework. Instead of a simple exchange of offers, the agents also offer arguments in favor of their proposals and critiques of received offers. Arguments can contain relevant new information about the state of the network, allowing the agents to update their knowledge base. The system is governed by a collection of rules and policies, which can be invoked in the support of requests or, in some cases, to justify their denial. To illustrate the proposed scheme, we designed a negotiation protocol and argumentation language for a communication model involving discrete service levels. We verify the flow of negotiation through a simulation study.","doi":"10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424064","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415465/6424021/06424064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424064","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops","startPage":"782","endPage":"789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Argumentation based negotiation in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Argumentation based negotiation in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424064/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272648","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Argumentation based negotiation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p782horine.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072714S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415465","isNumber":"6424021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415465","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424021","articleId":"6424064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424066,"authors":[{"name":"Adil Kamal Mir","affiliation":["Cognet Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adil Kamal","lastName":"Mir","id":"38548163400"},{"name":"Ahmed Akram","affiliation":["Cognet Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Akram","id":"38547486300"},{"name":"Ejaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Cognet Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ejaz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37864304800"},{"name":"Junaid Qadir","affiliation":["Cognet Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Qadir","id":"37298438800"},{"name":"Adeel Baig","affiliation":["Cognet Laboratory, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adeel","lastName":"Baig","id":"37281980400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2130-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2128-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424066","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Unicast","Heuristic algorithms","Mathematical model","Equations","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","radio networks","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified channel assignment scheme","unicast traffic","cognitive radio networks","wireless devices","wireless Web applications","radio frequency spectrum","wireless radio spectrum","CRN","communication mode","neighboring nodes","wireless broadcast traffic","UCA algorithm","interference parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast Traffic","Channel Assignment","Cognitive Radio Networks","Unicast Traffic"]}],"abstract":"The rising density of wireless devices, combined with the availability of a plethora of wireless web applications, has overcrowded the radio frequency spectrum. Majority of the present wireless radio spectrum is already licensed; however, studies have shown that the licensed spectrum is significantly underutilized. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are envisioned to utilize the radio spectrum more efficiently. CRNs may be required to handle both unicast and broadcast traffic, which makes the task of channel assignment in CRNs more challenging, as communication mode required for each type of traffic is different. Unicast traffic may suffer due to interference if the same channel is assigned to and used by neighboring nodes; on the other hand for broadcast traffic if a larger set of neighbors share a common channel, any particular node may exploit wireless broadcast advantage to communicate with a maximum number of neighbors in a single transmission. Existing channel assignment schemes either favor unicast or broadcast traffic only. In this paper a Unified Channel Assignment (UCA) algorithm is proposed which assigns channels according to their respective interference and connectivity parameters depending on the proportions of unicast and broadcast traffic in the network.","doi":"10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424066","displayPublicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415465/6424021/06424066.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424066","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops","startPage":"799","endPage":"806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified channel assignment for unicast and broadcast traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Unified channel assignment for unicast and broadcast traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424066/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424066/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272650","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified channel assignment for unicast and broadcast traffic in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"p799mir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065299S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415465","isNumber":"6424021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415465","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6424021","articleId":"6424066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424088,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Kothmayr","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chair for Network Architectures and Services, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kothmayr","id":"38548658100"},{"name":"Corinna Schmitt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chair for Network Architectures and Services, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Corinna","lastName":"Schmitt","id":"37392564200"},{"name":"Wen Hu","affiliation":["CSIRO ICT Centre, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37273484100"},{"name":"Michael Br\u00fcnig","affiliation":["CSIRO ICT Centre, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Br\u00fcnig","id":"37370471200"},{"name":"Georg Carle","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chair for Network Architectures and Services, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Carle","id":"37297186600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2129-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2130-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2128-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424088","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1705},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Protocols","Ciphers","Peer to peer computing","Internet","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","Internet","Internet of Things","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DTLS based end-to-end security architecture","Internet of Things","two-way authentication","IoT","Internet standards","datagram transport layer security protocol","DTLS protocol","public key cryptography","RSA","low power communication stack","security infrastructure","security uptake","low-power hardware platform","interoperability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424088","doi":"10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424088","publicationTitle":"37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the first fully implemented two way authentication security scheme for the Internet of Things (IoT) based on existing Internet standards, especially the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.

In this paper we present our strategy of using mixed-bandwidth training data to improve wideband speech recognition accuracy in the CD-DNN-HMM framework. We show that DNNs provide the flexibility of using arbitrary features. By using the Mel-scale log-filter bank features we not only achieve higher recognition accuracy than using MFCCs, but also can formulate the mixed-bandwidth training problem as a missing feature problem, in which several feature dimensions have no value when narrowband speech is presented. This treatment makes training CD-DNN-HMMs with mixed-bandwidth data an easy task since no bandwidth extension is needed. Our experiments on voice search data indicate that the proposed solution not only provides higher recognition accuracy for the wideband speech but also allows the same CD-DNN-HMM to recognize mixed-bandwidth speech. By exploiting mixed-bandwidth training data CD-DNN-HMM outperforms fMPE+BMMI trained GMM-HMM, which cannot benefit from using narrowband data, by 18.4%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271922","htmlLink":"/document/6424210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving wideband speech recognition using mixed-bandwidth training data in CD-DNN-HMM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving wideband speech recognition using mixed-bandwidth training data in CD-DNN-HMM","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140824S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416134","isNumber":"6424159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416134","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6424159","articleId":"6424210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6424212,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Li","id":"37715667400"},{"name":"Huifeng Zhu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huifeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38547207100"},{"name":"Gong Cheng","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gong","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38546955000"},{"name":"Kit Thambiratnam","affiliation":["Microsoft Search Technology Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kit","lastName":"Thambiratnam","id":"37298846600"},{"name":"Behrooz Chitsaz","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Chitsaz","id":"38546952100"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Frank Seide","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Seide","id":"37284532700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5126-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5125-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5124-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424212","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-dependent Deep Neural Networks for audio indexing of real-life data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424212","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Computational modeling","Speech recognition","Runtime","Indexing","Switches","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio indexing","real-life data","context dependent deep neural network HMM","CD-DNN-HMM","switchboard benchmark","speaker independent transcription","Gaussian-mixture HMM","speaker adaptive GMM system","speech recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","deep neural networks","deep learning","audio indexing"]}],"abstract":"We apply Context-Dependent Deep-Neural-Network HMMs, or CD-DNN-HMMs, to the real-life problem of audio indexing of data across various sources.

This paper takes CD-DNN-HMM based recognition into a real-life deployment for audio indexing. We find that for our best speaker-independent CD-DNN-HMM, with 32k senones trained on 2000h of data, the one-fourth reduction does carry over to inhomogeneous field data (video podcasts and talks). Compared to a speaker-adaptive GMM system, the relative improvement is 18%, at very similar end-to-end runtime. In system building, we find that DNNs can benefit from a larger number of senones than the GMM-HMM; and that DNN likelihood evaluation is a sizeable runtime factor even in our wide-beam context of generating rich lattices: Cutting the model size by 60% reduces runtime by one-third at a 5% relative WER loss.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2012.6424212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2012.6424212","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416134/6424159/06424212.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Context-dependent Deep Neural Networks for audio indexing of real-life data","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271924","htmlLink":"/document/6424212/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-dependent Deep Neural Networks for audio indexing of real-life data","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066627S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416134","isNumber":"6424159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416134","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6424159","articleId":"6424212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6424215,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Marin","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Marin","id":"38564314200"},{"name":"Tom Kwiatkowski","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","id":"38546724700"},{"name":"Mari Ostendorf","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Ostendorf","id":"37282049300"},{"name":"Luke Zettlemoyer","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Luke","lastName":"Zettlemoyer","id":"38546974000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5126-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5125-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5124-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424215","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of detecting words that are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) for a speech recognition system to improve automatic speech translation.

The previously developed deep convex network (DCN) is extended to its kernel version (K-DCN) where the number of hidden units in each DCN layer approaches infinity using the kernel trick. We report experimental results demonstrating dramatic error reduction achieved by the K-DCN over both the Boosting-based baseline and the DCN on a domain classification task of SLU, especially when a highly correlated set of features extracted from search query click logs are used. Not only can DCN and K-DCN be used as a domain or intent classifier for SLU, they can also be used as local, discriminative feature extractors for the slot filling task of SLU. The interface of K-DCN to slot filling systems via the softmax function is presented. Finally, we outline an end-to-end learning strategy for training the softmax parameters (and potentially all DCN and K-DCN parameters) where the learning objective can take any performance measure (e.g. the F-measure) for the full SLU system.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2012.6424224","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416134/6424159/06424224.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2012.6424224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of kernel deep convex networks and end-to-end learning for spoken language understanding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Feature extraction","Error analysis","Training","Hidden Markov models","Filling","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","query processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel deep convex network","spoken language understanding","deep learning technique","SLU","dramatic error reduction","K-DCN","boosting-based baseline","domain classification task","correlation set","search query click log","discriminative feature extraction","slot filling system","softmax function","end-to-end learning strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["kernel learning","deep learning","spoken language understanding","domain detection","slot filling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Use of kernel deep convex networks and end-to-end learning for spoken language understanding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424224/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271934","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of kernel deep convex networks and end-to-end learning for spoken language understanding","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069778S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416134","isNumber":"6424159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416134","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6424159","articleId":"6424224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6424227,"authors":[{"name":"Larry Heck","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Heck","id":"38275102700"},{"name":"Dilek Hakkani-T\u00fcr","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, USA"],"firstName":"Dilek","lastName":"Hakkani-T\u00fcr","id":"38547269000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5126-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5125-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5124-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424227","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Motion pictures","Detectors","Companies","Training","Knowledge based systems","Semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entity-relationship modelling","graph theory","information retrieval","natural language processing","semantic Web","unsupervised learning","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic Web","unsupervised spoken language understanding","unsupervised training approach","SLU systems","structured semantic knowledge graphs","natural language surface","entity-relation-entity portions","knowledge graphs","Web search retrieval","syntax-based dependency parsing","intent detection","unsupervised training procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spoken language understanding","intent detection","structured knowledge-based search","semantic web"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424227","abstract":"This paper proposes an unsupervised training approach for SLU systems that leverages the structured semantic knowledge graphs of the emerging Semantic Web.

Exactly for this reason, the final BN-features are considered as language independent. In the experiments with GlobalPhone database, we show that Multilingual BN-features consistently outperform Monolingual BN-features. Also, cross-lingual generalization is evaluated, where we train on 5 source languages and test on 3 other languages.

We adapt a source recognizer on the target accent by selecting a relatively small, matched subset of utterances from a large, untranscribed and multi-accented corpus for human transcription. Traditionally, active learning in speech recognition has relied on uncertainty based sampling to choose the most informative data for manual labeling. Such an approach doesn't include explicit relevance criterion during data selection, which is crucial for choosing utterances to match the target accent, from datasets with wide-ranging speakers of different accents. We formulate a cross-entropy based relevance measure to complement uncertainty based sampling for active learning to aid accent adaptation. We evaluate the algorithm on two different setups for Arabic and English accents and show that our approach performs favorably to conventional data selection. We analyze the results to show the effectiveness of our approach in finding the most relevant subset of utterances for improving the speech recognizer on the target accent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271960","htmlLink":"/document/6424250/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active learning for accent adaptation in Automatic Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning for accent adaptation in Automatic Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083171S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416134","isNumber":"6424159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416134","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6424159","articleId":"6424250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424251,"authors":[{"name":"Kaisheng Yao","affiliation":["Online Service Division, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaisheng","lastName":"Yao","id":"37712878600"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Frank Seide","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Seide","id":"37284532700"},{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Su","id":"38547090600"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Yifan Gong","affiliation":["Online Service Division, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271888900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5126-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5125-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5124-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424251","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":726},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of context-dependent deep neural networks for automatic speech recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416134/6424159/06424251.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2012.6424251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424159","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2012.6424251","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Adaptation models","Vectors","Stochastic processes","Speech recognition","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","hidden Markov models","neural nets","regression analysis","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-dependent deep neural network","automatic speech recognition","hidden Markov model","affine transformation","feature-space discriminative linear regression","fDLR method","vocabulary speech recognition task","stochastic gradient ascent implementation","word error rate","softmax layer adaptation technique","bias shift"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context-Dependent Deep-Neural-Networks","HMM","speech recognition","speaker adaptation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424251","abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation methods for context-dependent deep-neural-network hidden Markov models (CD-DNN-HMMs) for automatic speech recognition.

The feature-space discriminative linear regression (fDLR) method with the affine transformations on the input layer is also evaluated. On a large vocabulary speech recognition task, a stochastic gradient ascent implementation of the fDLR and the top hidden layer adaptation is shown to reduce word error rates (WERs) by 17% and 14%, respectively, compared to the baseline DNN performances. With a batch update implementation, the softmax layer adaptation technique reduces WERs by 10%.

These unlicensed users, also called cognitive radios, must compete for the available frequency slots. The convergence of this system is difficult to achieve if nodes perform no information exchange and solely depend on their individual actions. In this paper, we analyze the cognitive radio networks for distributed channel allocation. It is observed that convergence is easier to establish in cooperative systems or systems where users perform information exchange. This kind of cooperative behavior can be enforced by providing incentives to nodes. The cooperation leads to an improvement in overall network performance as compared to the selfish users who are concerned only with their individual benefits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424289/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13272035","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424289/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Potential Game Convergence of Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential Game Convergence of Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062354S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6424291,"authors":[{"name":"Anam Raza","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Anam","lastName":"Raza","id":"37063408900"},{"name":"Syed Sohail Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Sohail","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37533825000"},{"name":"Waleed Ejaz","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Ejaz","id":"37671665700"},{"name":"Hyung Seok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37696369900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4927-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4946-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424291","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Manganese","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Network topology","Simulation","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","mobility management (mobile radio)","probability","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","mobile node","cognitive radio distributed network","consensus based algorithm","energy detection","random walk mobility model","missing detection probability","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","Mobile Ad Hoc network","distributive network","energy detection","software defined radio","spectrum sensing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing among Mobile Nodes in Cognitive Radio Distributed Network","doi":"10.1109/FIT.2012.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424278","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422824/6424278/06424291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIT.2012.12","startPage":"18","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424291","abstract":"Recent advancements in communication have introduced several networking paradigms one of which is Cognitive Radio Network (CRN).

Consensus based algorithms are being developed by researchers to attain reliable spectrum sensing for which various techniques are employed. In this paper, the authors implement a consensus based algorithm by using energy detection as sensing technique and by utilizing cooperation among users. The consensus algorithm is applied on Mobile Nodes (MN) using random walk mobility model. Through this implementation an efficient cooperative spectrum sensing technique is proposed.

Only that content that matches the tags is returned as a result to the user. Given the ever-increasing immensity of videos on the internet, especially those with zero or irrelevant tags, such traditional methodology has eventually led to rise in ratio of missing important context. Content based searching within a video library is definitely an alternative solution but it requires time consuming computations and comparisons which renders exhaustive search unpractical. The purpose of this paper is to provide an efficient methodology that will lead to incremental improvement in the video search results against a user's query image. Our method employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an evolutionary population based search algorithm, to look for frames within the video library. The fitness of each swarm particle is the degree of similarity with respect to the content present in both the input image provided by the user and the video frame(s) fetched through PSO. This exempts us from the exhaustive and linear search of every frame of every video in the library. The relative best match in each generation of PSO is shown to the user for his engagement. For calculating the fitness of each swarm particle we have tested three similarity measures, 1) correlation based template matching, 2) score from scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm and, 3) convolution. Preliminary results on real video library are promising.","doi":"10.1109/FIT.2012.23","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422824/6424278/06424302.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIT.2012.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content Based Video Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Particle swarm optimization","Correlation","Convolution","Educational institutions","Databases","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","convolution","evolutionary computation","image matching","particle swarm optimisation","search engines","search problems","transforms","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content based video retrieval","particle swarm optimization","video search engines","user textual query","user tags","content based searching","video library","user query image","PSO","evolutionary population based search algorithm","video frame","correlation based template matching","scale-invariant feature transform algorithm","SIFT algorithm","convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content based Video Retrieval","Particle Swarm Optimization","Template Matching","Scale Invariant Feature Transform","Convolution","Correlation coefficient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Content Based Video Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272046","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content Based Video Retrieval Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112826S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6424306,"authors":[{"name":"Rabiah Badar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Comsats Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rabiah","lastName":"Badar","id":"37680867300"},{"name":"Laiq Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Comsats Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Laiq","lastName":"Khan","id":"37074624300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4927-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4946-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424306","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"The supplementary damping control can be efficiently used for Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers to damp the low frequency oscillations in single and multi-machine power systems.

Next it is shown through simulations that the OS test statistic does not provide maximum probability of detection for a desired probability of false alarm and results are provided showing the regions of high probability of detection for desired probability of false alarm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272056","htmlLink":"/document/6424313/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08647S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424314,"authors":[{"name":"Atta-Ur-Rahman","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Islamabad Campus, Pakistan"],"lastName":"Atta-Ur-Rahman","id":"38280057700"},{"name":"Ijaz Mansoor Qureshi","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Islamabad Campus, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ijaz Mansoor","lastName":"Qureshi","id":"37298727100"},{"name":"Muhammad Tahir Naseem","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Islamabad Campus, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Tahir","lastName":"Naseem","id":"38309493900"},{"name":"Muhammad Zeeshan Muzaffar","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Islamabad Campus, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Zeeshan","lastName":"Muzaffar","id":"38356015200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4927-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4946-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424314","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424314","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Quality of service","Product codes","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","error statistics","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","fuzzy rule base system","rate enhancement scheme","OFDM based hyperlan","adaptive communication","constrained optimization problem","multicarrier OFDM environment","optimum code rate","modulation symbol","channel state information","bit error rate","product code","quadrature amplitude modulation","adaptive coding","adaptive modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GA","OFDM","FRBS","BER","ACM","Modulation Code Pair","Product Codes"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive communication is need and feature of every current communication system. In this technique the transmission parameters are adapted in such a way that overall system throughput may be enhanced while satisfying certain number of constraints. In short this is a constrained optimization problem. In this paper a similar constrained optimization problem is focused and solved by making certain parameters adaptive that are code rate, modulation scheme and transmit power in a multicarrier OFDM environment. For adapting the said parameters a Fuzzy Rule Base System (FRBS) is used in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA). So FRBS and GA suggest the optimum code rate, modulation symbol and power with respect to the channel state information (CSI) given at any instance that can maximize the throughput while satisfying constraints like power and bit error rate (BER). Product codes and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) are used as coding and modulation schemes respectively. Simulation results show the significance of proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/FIT.2012.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIT.2012.35","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422824/6424278/06424314.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GA-FRBS Based Rate Enhancement Scheme for OFDM Based Hyperlans","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424314/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A GA-FRBS Based Rate Enhancement Scheme for OFDM Based Hyperlans","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272057","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6424314/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GA-FRBS Based Rate Enhancement Scheme for OFDM Based Hyperlans","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061645S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6424316,"authors":[{"name":"A.

After long run selection process, five finalists were selected for Round 3. Winner of this competition will be announced later in 2012. Blake is one of the candidates of round three of this competition. Along with the strength of security, efficient hardware implementation is also major evaluation criteria for final selection. Blake algorithm compression function is based on G-Function which executes 8 times in one round. In this paper, different architecture schemes named as 8G, 4G and 1G has been implemented on FPGA, based on serialization of Round Function processes. Optimization is performed by selecting appropriate numbers of LUTs and Slice Registers according to the Virtex 5 Device Architecture Resources. Implementation results of each design are compared with each other and with other design contributions. Full autonomous design for each scheme is implemented on Virtex 5 xc5vlx50t-3 FPGA. Common I/O and control interface is provided to find out the fair comparison results. For tradeoff analysis three design optimization techniques based on 'area', 'speed' and 'balance' designs are used. We found 8G architecture provides the best through-put, 1G provides least area implementation and 4G provides the most efficient results in terms of throughput per area (TPA). 4G design gives Tpa of 2.1. Our design methodology and optimization strategy gives improved results from previous contributions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Algorithm design and analysis","Field

We applied the evolutionary technique of Cartesian Genetic programming Evolved Artificial Neural Network (CG-PANN) for the detection of three important diseases. Some cases showed excellent results while others are in the process of experimentation. In the first case we worked on diagnosing the extent of Parkinson's disease using a computer based test. Experiments in this case are in progress. In the second case, we applied the Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) data for Breast Cancer from the WDBC website to our network to classify the samples as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The results from these experiments were highly satisfactory. In the third case, we developed a modified form of Pan-Tompkins's algorithm to detect the fiducial points from ECG signals and extracted key features from them. The features shall be applied to our network to classify the signals for the different types of Arrhythmias. Experimentation is still in progress.","doi":"10.1109/FIT.2012.54","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422824/6424278/06424333.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"268","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIT.2012.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-signal Processing Using Cartesian Genetic Programming Evolved Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bio-signal Processing Using Cartesian Genetic Programming Evolved Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272068","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6424333/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-signal Processing Using Cartesian Genetic Programming Evolved Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN)","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051749S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6424345,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Shiraz","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shiraz","id":"38488623600"},{"name":"Abdullah Gani","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Gani","id":"37682537100"},{"name":"Rashid Hafeez Khokhar","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rashid Hafeez","lastName":"Khokhar","id":"38199035000"},{"name":"Ejaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ejaz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37864304800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4927-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4946-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424345","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":686},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Random access memory","Computational modeling","Program processors","Memory management","Smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extendable simulation framework","smart mobile device","mobile cloud computing","MCC","cloud data center","resources constraint","distributed services","operational logic","distributed deployment","SmartSim","SMD","runtime partitioning","elastic mobile application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Cloud Computing","Smart Mobile Devices","Application Offloading","Distributed Application"]}],"abstract":"The recent efforts in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) focus on defining novel methods, policies and mechanisms for efficiently leveraging the services of cloud data centers for mitigating resources constraints in mobile devices. To test these newly developed methods and policies, researchers need tools for evaluating the hypothesis prior to deployment on the real time system. Simulation based approaches in evaluating the deployment mechanism for accessing distributed services and application behaviors offer significant benefits, as they allow mobile application developers to test performance of the operational logic of distributed deployment in a repeatable and controllable environment free of cost and to tune the performance bottlenecks before real world deployment on commercial MCC environment. This paper presents SmartSim, which is a simulation toolkit developed for modeling the application processing capabilities of Smart Mobile Devices (SMDs). SmartSim simulates the system and behavior modeling of mobile devices. The toolkit provides an easy to configure simulation environment for modeling application processing attributes of SMD and arbitrary resources intensive mobile application. SmartSim models the mechanism of runtime partitioning of elastic mobile application and determines resources utilization on SMDs during the execution of the elastic application.","doi":"10.1109/FIT.2012.66","publicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6422824/6424278/06424345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIT.2012.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424278","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Extendable Simulation Framework for Modeling Application Processing Potentials of Smart Mobile Devices for Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Extendable Simulation Framework for Modeling Application Processing Potentials of Smart Mobile Devices for Mobile Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424345/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272075","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6424345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extendable Simulation Framework for Modeling Application Processing Potentials of Smart Mobile Devices for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"4927a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049202S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6422824","isNumber":"6424278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6422824","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6424278","articleId":"6424345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6424377,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Zagoris","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (PRImA) Research Laboratory School of Computing, Science and Engineering, University of Salford, Greater Manchester, UK","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Zagoris","id":"37295346300"},{"name":"Ioannis Pratikakis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pratikakis","id":"37869410200"},{"name":"Apostolos Antonacopoulos","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (PRImA) Research Laboratory School of Computing, Science and Engineering, University of Salford, Greater Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Antonacopoulos","id":"37269266700"},{"name":"Basilis Gatos","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Basilis","lastName":"Gatos","id":"37726641000"},{"name":"Nikos Papamarkos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Papamarkos","id":"37294840400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2262-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424377","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Noise","Image segmentation","Hidden Markov models","Gabor filters","Handwriting recognition","Text recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwritten character recognition","image classification","support vector machines","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten text separation","machine printed text separation","document image","bag of visual words paradigm","document type","archive document","book","annotation","digitisation pipeline","recognition pipeline","recognition methodology","BoVW","descriptor","support vector machine classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bag of visual words","support vector machines","SIFT"]}],"abstract":"In a number of types of documents, ranging from forms to archive documents and books with annotations, machine printed and handwritten text may be present in the same document image, giving rise to significant issues within a digitisation and recognition pipeline. It is therefore necessary to separate the two types of text before applying different recognition methodologies to each. In this paper, a new approach is proposed which strives towards identifying and separating handwritten from machine printed text using the Bag of Visual Words paradigm (BoVW). Initially, blocks of interest are detected in the document image. For each block, a descriptor is calculated based on the BoVW. The final characterization of the blocks as Handwritten, Machine Printed or Noise is made by a Support Vector Machine classifier. The promising performance of the proposed approach is shown by using a consistent evaluation methodology which couples meaningful measures along with a new dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2012.207","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423130/6424356/06424377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2012.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424356","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten and Machine Printed Text Separation in Document Images Using the Bag of Visual Words Paradigm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Handwritten and Machine Printed Text Separation in Document Images Using the Bag of Visual Words Paradigm","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424377/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272095","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6424377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten and Machine Printed Text Separation in Document Images Using the Bag of Visual Words Paradigm","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"4774a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066198S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423130","isNumber":"6424356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423130","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6424356","articleId":"6424377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424379,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Haji","affiliation":["CENPARMI, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Haji","id":"38547247400"},{"name":"Kalyan Asis Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, IIT, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Kalyan Asis","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"38546916000"},{"name":"Tien D.

In this paper a new approach to mode detection is proposed that uses bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM) neural networks. The BLSTM neural network is a novel type of recursive neural network that has been successfully applied in speech and handwriting recognition. In this paper we show that it has the potential to significantly outperform traditional methods for mode detection, which are usually based on stroke classification. As a further advantage over previous approaches, the proposed system is trainable and does not rely on user-defined heuristics. Moreover, it can be easily adapted to new or additional types of modes by just providing the system with new training data.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2012.232","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423130/6424356/06424410.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2012.232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode Detection in Online Handwritten Documents Using BLSTM Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neural networks","Handwriting recognition","Databases","Writing","Accuracy","Ink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwritten character recognition","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode detection","online handwritten document","bidirectional long-short term memory neural network","recursive neural network","speech recognition","handwriting recognition","stroke classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online Data","Layout Analysis","Mode Detection","Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mode Detection in Online Handwritten Documents Using BLSTM Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Detection in Online Handwritten Documents Using BLSTM Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"4774a302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119673S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423130","isNumber":"6424356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423130","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6424356","articleId":"6424410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6424426,"authors":[{"name":"Anis Mezghani","affiliation":["University of Sfax, ISIMS, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Anis","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"38547021200"},{"name":"Slim Kanoun","affiliation":["University of Sfax, ISIMS, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Kanoun","id":"37324228300"},{"name":"Maher Khemakhem","affiliation":["University of Sfax, ISIMS, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Khemakhem","id":"37320394900"},{"name":"Haikal El Abed","affiliation":["Braunschweig Technical University, Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Haikal El","lastName":"Abed","id":"37691420400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2262-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424426","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":444},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Text recognition","Shape","Image databases","Educational institutions","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","handwritten character recognition","natural language processing","text analysis","visual databases","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["writer identification","Arabic handwritten text image database","multiple writers","AHTID/MW","Arabic handwritten text image recognition","open vocabulary","word segmentation","text line","ground truth annotation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arabic Handwritten text image","AHTID/MW Database","open vocabulary","Ground truth"]}],"abstract":"Standard databases play essential roles for evaluating and comparing results obtained by different groups of researchers.

As matter of this fact, multi-classifier systems have been widely adopted in many applications for which very high classification performance is necessary. Notwithstanding, multi-classifier system design is still an open problem. In fact, complexity of multi-classifiers systems make the theoretical evaluation of system performance very difficult and, consequently, also the design of a multi-classifier system. This paper presents a new approach for the design of a multi-classifier system. In particular, the problem of feature selection for a multi-classifier system is addressed and a genetic algorithm is proposed for automatic selecting the optimal set of features for each individual classifier of the multi-classifier system. The experimental results, carried out in the field of handwritten digit recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICFHR.2012.237","startPage":"560","endPage":"564","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423130/6424356/06424455.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR.2012.237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-classifier System Configuration Using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Handwriting recognition","Classification algorithms","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","handwritten character recognition","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclassifier system configuration","genetic algorithm","classifier combination","pattern classification problems","multiclassifier system design","handwritten digit recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-classifier System","Digit Recognition","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-classifier System Configuration Using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272161","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-classifier System Configuration Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"4774a560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114914S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423130","isNumber":"6424356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423130","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424356","articleId":"6424455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6424468,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Saqib Bukhari","affiliation":["Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Syed Saqib","lastName":"Bukhari","id":"37590053400"},{"name":"Thomas M.

Although such annotated databases of unconstrained handwriting exist for several scripts of a few languages, the same is not true for any of the scripts of India. As far as Indian scripts are concerned a few databases of handwritten isolated characters are publicly available. These include samples of both online and offline handwriting. However, no such publicly available database of unconstrained handwriting in any of the Indian scripts exists. On the other hand, unconstrained handwriting in Bangla, the second most popular among Indian scripts, is mixed cursive in nature unlike the other scripts of India. Thus, annotation of Bangla unconstrained handwriting samples needs special consideration. During the last few years our group at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata has been working towards the development of a large annotated database of online Bangla handwriting samples and has developed a GUI-based semi-automatic scheme for their annotation at character boundary levels and a scheme for XML representation of such annotated data. The present system implemented for annotation of unconstrained handwriting of Bangla may easily be customized for other scripts. Currently this system is in use for annotation of a large database of Bangla unconstrained online handwriting.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6424475/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285560","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-automatic Annotation Scheme for Bangla Online Mixed Cursive Handwriting Samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-automatic Annotation Scheme for Bangla Online Mixed Cursive Handwriting Samples","confLoc":"Bari, Italy","sourcePdf":"4774a680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051573S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423130","isNumber":"6424356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423130","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6424356","articleId":"6424475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6424486,"authors":[{"name":"Somaya Al Maadeed","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Somaya Al","lastName":"Maadeed","id":"37085748056"},{"name":"Wael Ayouby","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Ayouby","id":"37088153850"},{"name":"Abdel\u00e2ali Hassa\u00efne","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Abdel\u00e2ali","lastName":"Hassa\u00efne","id":"38330330600"},{"name":"Jihad Mohamad Aljaam","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Jihad Mohamad","lastName":"Aljaam","id":"38251654000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2262-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424486","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":568},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424486","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Writing","Educational institutions","Handwriting recognition","Forensics","Image color analysis","Standards","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","natural languages","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QUWI dataset","Arabic handwriting dataset","English handwriting dataset","Qatar University writer identification dataset","offline writer identification systems","handwritten documents","education levels","genders levels","nationalities","ages","random text generation","text-dependent writer identification tasks"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new offline dataset called the Qatar University Writer Identification dataset (QUWI).

The advantage is that each mobile node can communicate with more mobile nodes within the transmission range and packets can reach the destination rapidly in fewer hops. However using the maximum transmission radius will induce high power consumption. We proposed the Hierarchical Cell Relay (HCR) scheme earlier, which is a hierarchical topology routing protocol for the MANETs. In order to enhance the performance of HCR, in this paper we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to find a suitable transmission radius for each node. The nodes do not use maximum transmission radius in order to prolong the network lifetime. In addition to comparing the enhanced HCR with the original HCR, we also compare it to another hierarchical topology routing protocol - Adaptive Cell Relay (ACR). The comparison results show that using PSO in HCR can reduce energy consumption without sacrificing the packet transmission delay.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2012.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423129/6424528/06424552.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"129","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Networking and Computing","publicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Networking and Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2012.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Enhancing the Hierarchical Cell Relay Routing Protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Enhancing the Hierarchical Cell Relay Routing Protocol","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13285488","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6424552/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Particle Swarm Optimization for Enhancing the Hierarchical Cell Relay Routing Protocol","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"4893a125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045924S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423129","isNumber":"6424528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423129","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424528","articleId":"6424552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6424560,"authors":[{"name":"Takaaki Miyajima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaaki","lastName":"Miyajima","id":"37070584400"},{"name":"David Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37289926400"},{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideharu","lastName":"Amano","id":"37280731600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4624-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4893-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424560","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Acceleration","Graphics processing units","Parallel processing","Data transfer","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","data flow computing","graphics processing units","operating system kernels","program compilers","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain specific language","toolchain","OpenCV runtime binary acceleration","GPU","computationally intensive applications","accelerators","accelerated system","offloaded kernels","accelerator-specific tools","low-level parallelism","system-level parallelism","Courier tool chain","dataflow","software binary file","off-loaded execution time","mixed software-hardware environment","target application source code","accelerator architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Runtime Binary Acceleration","Domain Spefic Language","OpenCV","Dynamic Off-loading","GPU"]}],"abstract":"Computationally intensive applications, such as OpenCV, can be off-loaded to accelerators to reduce execution time. However, developing an accelerated system requires a significant amount of time, requiring the developer to first choose an accelerator and which parts to off-load, then to port and the offloaded kernels to the accelerator using many accelerator-specific tools. In addition to the low-level parallelism of the accelerator, the developer also needs to extract and utilize system-level parallelism found within the application, while making sure that the application still executes correctly. This paper presents Courier, a tool chain and a domain specific language for Runtime Binary Acceleration, designed to simplify many of the steps involved in accelerating an application. The Courier tool chain can extract dataflow from a running software binary file, explore the off-loaded execution time on an accelerator, and then actually accelerate the original binary. By utilizing Courier, both expert and non-expert users can easily extract system-level parallelism and decide which part should be off-loaded to accelerators in a mixed software-hardware environment, without special knowledge on the target application source code and accelerator architecture. In a case study an OpenCV application is accelerated by 2.06 times using Courier, without requiring the application source code or any re-compilation of the application.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2012.34","publicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Networking and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third International Conference on Networking and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423129/6424528/06424560.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2012.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Domain Specific Language and Toolchain for OpenCV Runtime Binary Acceleration Using GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424560/","displayDocTitle":"A Domain Specific Language and Toolchain for OpenCV Runtime Binary Acceleration Using GPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285495","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424560/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain Specific Language and Toolchain for OpenCV Runtime Binary Acceleration Using GPU","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"4893a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042752S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423129","isNumber":"6424528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423129","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424528","articleId":"6424560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6424579,"authors":[{"name":"Shiori Kurazumi","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shiori","lastName":"Kurazumi","id":"38547312100"},{"name":"Tomoaki Tsumura","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Tsumura","id":"37667750600"},{"name":"Shoichi Saito","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichi","lastName":"Saito","id":"37673127700"},{"name":"Hiroshi Matsuo","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Matsuo","id":"37672098700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4624-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4893-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424579","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Central Processing Unit","Dynamic scheduling","Distributed databases","File systems","Cloud computing","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed databases","input-output programs","public domain software","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic processing slots scheduling","I/O intensive jobs","Hadoop MapReduce","Hadoop distributed file system","HDES","distributed processing","cloud computing enterprises","I/O wait","CPU resources","active task tracker node","CPU performance improvement","Hadoop 1.0.3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hadoop","MapReduce","Scheduling algorithm","Slots Scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Hadoop, consists of Hadoop MapReduce and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), is a platform for large scale data and processing.

Results from the experiments find that with the makeup effect considered, the method proposed in this paper can improve accuracy by 0.9-6.7% in CS (Cumulative Score) and 0.26-9.76 in MAE (Mean of Absolute Errors between the estimated age and the ground truth age labeled or acquired from the data) comparing with other age estimation methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424013/6424436/06424642.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2012.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2012.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying the Makeup Effect in Female Faces and Its Applications for Age Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Estimation","Image edge detection","Accuracy","Detectors","Image color analysis","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","face recognition","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["female face makeup effect","age estimation","statistical study","facial parts makeup effect","makeup detection","input facial image","Young index","YI","female age estimation","MAE","absolute errors mean"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Makeup Detection","Makeup Quantification","Age Estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying the Makeup Effect in Female Faces and Its Applications for Age Estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285629","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying the Makeup Effect in Female Faces and Its Applications for Age Estimation","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4875a108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.173307S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424013","isNumber":"6424436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424013","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6424436","articleId":"6424642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6424701,"authors":[{"name":"Houssemeddine Khemiri","affiliation":["CNRS-LTCI-SAMOVAR, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech/SudParis, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Houssemeddine","lastName":"Khemiri","id":"38276820200"},{"name":"Dijana Petrovska-Delacr\u00e9taz","affiliation":["CNRS-SAMOVAR, T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Dijana","lastName":"Petrovska-Delacr\u00e9taz","id":"38547629900"},{"name":"G\u00e9rard Chollet","affiliation":["CNRS-LTCI, T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"G\u00e9rard","lastName":"Chollet","id":"37284910200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4370-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4875-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424701","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Hidden Markov models","Table lookup","Vectors","Approximation algorithms","Protocols","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","music","radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generic audio identification system","radio broadcast monitoring","advertisement identification","song identification","automatically acquired segmental unit","fingerprinting method","ALISP data driven segmentation","modified BLAST algorithm","approximate matching","Levenshtein distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ALISP units","audio identification","audio finger-printing","data-driven audio segmentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424701","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2012.87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2012.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424436","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424013/6424436/06424701.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Audio Identification System for Radio Broadcast Monitoring Based on Data-Driven Segmentation","abstract":"In this paper, a generic audio identification system is introduced to identify advertisements and songs in radio broadcast streams using automatically acquired segmental units.

The system is described and evaluated on broadcast audio streams from 12 French radio stations.

In CDN architecture, the multimedia contents are replicated from the origin server to replica servers in order to improve the performance and minimize the use of network bandwidth. Efficient placing the multimedia contents in CDN is a challenging problem. There are five factors that can be used to determine the placement of multimedia contents, they are bandwidth availability, connection availability, storage availability, CPU availability, and memory availability. In this paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to solve this issue. PSO algorithm uses these five different input parameters as different dimensions. In this five dimension searching space, PSO algorithm can find out the global optimal solution. With this global optimal solution, it is the most appropriate replica server that must place the multimedia content. The simulation results show that the PSO algorithm can achieve a better performance than other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424735/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13431723","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424735/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2013","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm in Multimedia CDN Content Placement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm in Multimedia CDN Content Placement","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4898a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047423S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423304","isNumber":"6424721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423304","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6424721","articleId":"6424735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6424758,"authors":[{"name":"Jagpreet Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, India"],"firstName":"Jagpreet","lastName":"Singh","id":"38647239200"},{"name":"Bhargav Mangipudi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, India"],"firstName":"Bhargav","lastName":"Mangipudi","id":"38661308400"},{"name":"Sandeep Betha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Betha","id":"38645474700"},{"name":"Nitin Auluck","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, India"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Auluck","id":"37706033200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4566-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-3034"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-3042"}],"articleNumber":"6424758","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restricted Duplication Based MILP Formulation for Scheduling Task Graphs on Unrelated Parallel Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Schedules","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Approximation methods","Scheduling","Parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","integer programming","linear programming","parallel machines","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restricted duplication based MILP formulation","mixed integer linear program","task graph scheduling","unrelated parallel machines","schedule length reduction","RESDMILP","percentage gap"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MILP","Scheduling","Heterogeneous","Duplication","Multiprocessors"]}],"abstract":"Duplication has proved to be a vital technique for scheduling task graphs on a network of unrelated parallel machines. Few attempts have been made to model duplication in a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to reduce schedule length. Other known optimal MILPs duplicate a job on all the available processing elements and this increases their complexities. This paper proposes a new REStricted Duplication (RESDMILP) approach to model duplication in a MILP. The complexity of this model increases with the increase in the amount of duplication. Experiments conducted have revealed that RESDMILP achieves better runtimes when the problem instance is solved optimally and provides better lower bound and percentage gap if it is run for a fixed amount of time. The percentage gap is defined as (U B - LB)/U B where U B and LB are the upper and lower bounds achieved by the MILPs respectively.","doi":"10.1109/PAAP.2012.37","startPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fifth International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Programming","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423304/6424721/06424758.pdf","endPage":"209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAAP.2012.37","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424758/","displayDocTitle":"Restricted Duplication Based MILP Formulation for Scheduling Task Graphs on Unrelated Parallel Machines","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6424758/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13431746","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restricted Duplication Based MILP Formulation for Scheduling Task Graphs on Unrelated Parallel Machines","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4898a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086183S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423304","isNumber":"6424721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423304","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6424721","articleId":"6424758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6424760,"authors":[{"name":"Ping He","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"He","id":"38615732000"},{"name":"Hong Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Australia","School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279492700"},{"name":"Hui Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tian","id":"37270197800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4566-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-3034"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-3042"}],"articleNumber":"6424760","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Switches","Mobile handsets","Energy consumption","Broadcasting","MIMO","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","information dissemination","information retrieval","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","radio data systems","radio networks","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel data retrieval scheduling","nonconsecutive broadcast","MIMO wireless network","public information dissemination","wireless environment","mobile device","multiantenna","wireless data broadcast","parallel channel","balancing factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel data retrieval","wireless networks","nonconsecutive broadcast"]}],"abstract":"Wireless data broadcast is usually used to disseminate the public information to considerable clients in wireless environment.

In order to improve the performance of downloading requested data items, we propose a scheme of scheduling parallel data retrievals for non-consecutive broadcast to decrease access latency and energy consumption.

A recurrent task is specified as a directed a cyclic graph (DAG), a period, and a relative deadline. Each vertex of the DAG represents a sequential job, while the edges of the DAG represent precedence constraints between these jobs. All the jobs of the DAG are released simultaneously and need to complete execution within the specified relative deadline of their release. The task may release jobs in this manner an unbounded number of times, with successive releases occurring at least the specified period apart. The scheduling problem is to determine whether such a recurrent task can be scheduled to always meet all deadlines upon a specified number of processors that are dedicated for the use of this task. This problem is shown to be computationally intractable, but amenable to efficient approximate solutions. EDF is shown to be a good approximate scheduling algorithm. Polynomial and pseudo-polynomial schedulability tests, of differing effectiveness, are presented for determining whether a given task can be scheduled by EDF to always meet all deadlines on a specified number of processors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 33rd Real-Time Systems

correlations of events that have multiple attributions, i.e., node ID, application ID, event type, and event severity, in logs of large-scale cloud and HPC systems. Different from traditional transactional data, e.g., supermarket purchases, system logs have their unique characteristics, and hence we propose several innovative approaches to mining their correlations. We parse logs into an n-ary sequence where each event is identified by an informative nine-tuple. We propose a set of enhanced apriori-like algorithms for improving sequence mining efficiency, we propose an innovative abstraction-event correlation graphs (ECGs) to represent event correlations, and present an ECGs-based algorithm for fast predicting events. The experimental results on three logs of production cloud and HPC systems, varying from 433490 entries to 4747963 entries, show that our method can predict failures with a high precision and an acceptable recall rates.","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2012.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2012.40","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423306/6424823/06424841.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LogMaster: Mining Event Correlations in Logs of Large-Scale Cluster Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"LogMaster: Mining Event Correlations in Logs of Large-Scale Cluster Systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424841/","accessionNumber":"13272338","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424841/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LogMaster: Mining Event Correlations in Logs of Large-Scale Cluster Systems","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4784a071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074833S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423306","isNumber":"6424823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423306","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6424823","articleId":"6424841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6424881,"authors":[{"name":"Husanbir S.

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software failures. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloudwide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in production clouds, especially for newly managed or deployed systems. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. It employs data description using hypersphere for adaptive failure detection. Based on the cloud performance data, AAD detects possible failures, which are verified by the cloud operators. They are confirmed as either true failures with failure types or normal states. The algorithm adapts itself by recursively learning from these newly verified detection results to refine future detections. Meanwhile, it exploits the observed but undetected failure records reported by the cloud operators to identify new types of failures. We have implemented a prototype of the algorithm and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment. Our experimental results show that AAD can achieve more efficient and accurate failure detection than other existing scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423306/6424823/06424881.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"397","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 31st Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2012.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2012.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AAD: Adaptive Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Computing Infrastructures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Kernel","Cloud computing","Support vector machines","Sensitivity","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data acquisition","failure analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","recursive functions","security of data","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing infrastructure","adaptive anomaly detection system","complex computing infrastructure maintenance","runtime problem","software failure","hardware failure","autonomic failure detection","self-managing cloud resource","system level dependability assurance","cloud execution monitoring","runtime performance data collection","adaptive failure detection","AAD","recursive learning","cloud operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Dependable systems","Failure detection","Autonomic management","Learning algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"AAD: Adaptive Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Computing Infrastructures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424881/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272369","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AAD: Adaptive Anomaly Detection System for Cloud Computing Infrastructures","confLoc":"Irvine, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4784a396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039787S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423306","isNumber":"6424823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423306","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6424823","articleId":"6424881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6424891,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Jiekak","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Suisse","Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Jiekak","id":"38548779200"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Kermarrec","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, France"],"firstName":"Anne-Marie","lastName":"Kermarrec","id":"37293819000"},{"name":"Nicolas Le Scouarnec","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas Le","lastName":"Scouarnec","id":"37888279200"},{"name":"Gilles Straub","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Straub","id":"37680512300"},{"name":"Alexandre Van Kempen","affiliation":["Techna, Coueron, FR"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Van Kempen","id":"37888274100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4784-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"},{"format":"CD","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"6424891","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Availability","Encoding","Decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","Bandwidth","Systematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud system","data availability","erasure correcting code","data storage","network bandwidth","regenerating codes design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["regenerating codes","implementation","practical","system","adaptive"]}],"abstract":"The explosion of the amount of data stored in cloud systems calls for more efficient paradigms for redundancy.

However, addressing the dependability concern due to malicious attacks or unintentional software errors, which can potentially corrupt the system, has largely been left untouched by researchers.

ACVAS uses measured and predicted resource utilizations of a server to make admission control decisions for new user sessions. Instead of using the traditional on-off control, it implements per session admission control, which reduces the risk of over-admission. Moreover, instead of relying only on rejection of new sessions, ACVAS takes benefit of the cloud elasticity, which allows dynamic provisioning of cloud resources. It also implements a simple session deferment mechanism that reduces the number of rejected sessions while increasing session throughput. Thus, each admission control decision has three possible outcomes: admit, defer, or reject. Performance under varying user load is guaranteed by automatic adjustment and tuning of the admission control mechanism. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a discrete-event simulation.","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.22","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Session-Based Adaptive Admission Control Approach for Virtualized Application Servers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Session-Based Adaptive Admission Control Approach for Virtualized Application Servers","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424930/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272293","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6424930/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Session-Based Adaptive Admission Control Approach for Virtualized Application Servers","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101564S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424932,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The availability of cloud computing platforms has made available unlimited and scalable resource pools of computation and storage that can be used to enhance service quality for mobile applications. This paper exploits the observation that using local resources in close proximity to the user, i.e. local clouds, can increase the quality and performance of mobile applications. In contrast, public cloud offerings (e.g. Amazon Web Services) offer scalability at the cost of higher delays, higher power consumption and higher price on the mobile device. In this paper we introduce MAP Cloud, a hybrid, tiered cloud architecture consisting of local and public clouds and show how it can be leveraged to increase both performance and scalability of mobile applications. We model the mobile application as a workflow of tasks and aim to optimally decompose the set of tasks to execute on the mobile client and 2-tier cloud architecture considering multiple QoS factors such as power, price, and delay. Such an optimization is shown to be NP-Hard, we propose an efficient simulated annealing based heuristic, called CRAM that is able to achieve about84% of optimal solutions when the number of users is high. We evaluate CRAM and the 2-tier approach via implementation(on Android G2 devices and Amazon EC2, S3 and Cloud Front)and extensive simulation using two rich mobile applications(Video-Content Augmented Reality and Image processing). Our results indicate that MAP Cloud provides improved scalability as compared to local clouds, improved efficiency (power/delay)(about 32% lower delays and power) and about 40% decrease in price in comparison to only using public cloud.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424932.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAPCloud: Mobile Applications on an Elastic and Scalable 2-Tier Cloud Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Quality of service","Delay","Computer architecture","Mobile handsets","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","quality of service","resource allocation","simulated annealing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAPCloud","elastic 2-tier cloud architecture","scalable 2-tier cloud architecture","mobile devices","cloud computing platforms","scalable resource pools","service quality enhancement","local resources","local clouds","public cloud offerings","delays","power consumption","hybrid tiered cloud architecture","mobile application scalability","mobile application performance improvement","mobile client","QoS factors","optimization","NP-hard problem","simulated annealing-based heuristic","CRAM","quality of service","cloud resource allocation for mobile applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Computing","Cloud Computing","Resource Allocation","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MAPCloud: Mobile Applications on an Elastic and Scalable 2-Tier Cloud Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424932/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272295","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAPCloud: Mobile Applications on an Elastic and Scalable 2-Tier Cloud Architecture","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067432S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424933,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeru Imai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Imai","id":"38547625300"},{"name":"Thomas Chestna","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Chestna","id":"38546830600"},{"name":"Carlos A.

While other scalable frameworks (e.g., MapReduce or Google App Engine) force application developers to write programs following specific APIs, COS provides scalability in a general-purpose programming framework based on an actor-oriented programming language. When all executing VMs are highly utilized, COS scales a workload up by migrating mobile actors over to newly dynamically created VMs. When VM utilization drops, COS scales the workload down by consolidating actors and terminating idle VMs. Application-level migration is advantageous compared to VM migration especially in hybrid clouds in which migration costs over the Internet are critical to scale out the workloads. We demonstrate the general purpose programming approach using a tightly-coupled computation. We compare the performance of autonomous (i.e., COS-driven) versus ideal reconfiguration, as well as the impact of granularity of reconfiguration, i.e., VM migration versus application-level migration. Our results show promise for future fully automated cloud computing resource management systems that efficiently enable truly elastic and scalable general-purpose workloads.","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.53","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424933.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic Scalable Cloud Computing Using Application-Level Migration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424933/","displayDocTitle":"Elastic Scalable Cloud Computing Using Application-Level Migration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272296","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424933/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic Scalable Cloud Computing Using Application-Level Migration","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099634S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6424936,"authors":[{"name":"Tseng-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tseng-Yi","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238338200"},{"name":"Tsung-Tai Yeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Tsung-Tai","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38194567200"},{"name":"Hsin-Wen Wei","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Wen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37560315300"},{"name":"Yu-Xun Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Xun","lastName":"Fang","id":"38548206900"},{"name":"Wei-Kuan Shih","affiliation":["Institute of Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Kuan","lastName":"Shih","id":"37282746600"},{"name":"Tsan-sheng Hsu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsan-sheng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37275375800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4432-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4862-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424936","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drives","Hard disks","Resource management","Servers","Power demand","Arrays","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cloud computing","distributed databases","energy conservation","network operating systems","power aware computing","RAID"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CacheRAID","adaptive write cache policy","RAID disk array energy conservation","cloud storage","Google Storage","Microsoft Sky Drive","iCloud","Drop box","Mozy","disk power consumption","disk idle time","poor random writing performance","random read","distributed file systems","adaptive write cache mechanism","Cache RAID","redundant arrays of inexpensive disk","distributed storage systems","random access problems","RAID techniques","hard drives","software RAID system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud storage","RAID","cache","random access","distributed file system"]}],"abstract":"Cloud storage is a hot topic at the moment with Google's Google Storage, Microsoft's Sky Drive, iCloud, Drop box, Mozy and dozens of others.

The factors of disk power consumption include disk idle time, poor random writing performance and random read in distributed file systems. Hence, we present an adaptive write cache mechanism - Cache RAID. Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk (RAID) is widely used in modern distributed storage systems. Our Cache RAID aims to improve the random access problems that implicitly exist in RAID techniques to create more idle time of hard drives, and conserve RAID disk array energy.

Multi-tenancy database has been prevalent for hosting multiple tenants within a single DBMS while enabling effective resource sharing.

In such database systems, a key functionality for service providers is database replication, which is useful for availability, performance, elasticity, and quality of service. This paper presents RepliC, an approach to database replication in the cloud with quality of service, elasticity, and support tomulti-tenancy. In order to evaluate RepliC, some experiments that measure the quality of service and elasticity are presented.

In 2010, large-scale data center operations consume around 2% of the total energy use in the US. Meanwhile, the development of cloud computing in the IT industry possesses great potential for lowering energy consumption by partitioning and scheduling job requests among multiple computational servers. In this paper, we formulate stochastic integer programming models to minimize energy consumption of cloud computing servers over finite time periods, while maintaining a pre-specified quality of service (QoS) level for satisfying uncertain computational requests. The models dynamically monitor and predict customer requests for each period, and proactively switch servers on/off according to estimated customer requests. QoS levels are maintained by either enforcing zero unsatisfied requests, or imposing a joint chance constraint to bound possible failures in a backlogging model. When uncertain requests follow continuous distributions, we employ the Sampling Average Approximation for generating scenario-based requests. Such an approach transforms the original probabilistic model into deterministic mixed-integer linear programs. We further demonstrate computational results of all models by testing instances with different parameter combinations, and investigate how backlogging, unit penalty cost and QoS levels influence computational performances and optimal solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk and Energy Consumption Tradeoffs in Cloud Computing Service via Stochastic Optimization Models","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.37","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424956.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Risk and Energy Consumption Tradeoffs in Cloud Computing Service via Stochastic Optimization Models","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424956/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272315","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk and Energy Consumption Tradeoffs in Cloud Computing Service via Stochastic Optimization Models","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102583S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424958,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos D.

Applications become sophisticated and context-aware as the pervasiveness of technology increases. In order to cope with resource limitations of mobile-based environments, it is a common practice to delegate processing intensive components to a Cloud Computing infrastructure. In this scenario, executions of server-based jobs are still dependent on the local variations of the end-user context. We claim that there is a need for an advanced model for smarter services that combines techniques of context awareness and adaptive job scheduling. This model aims at rationalising the resource utilisation in a Cloud Computing environment, while leading to significant improvement of quality of service. In this paper, we introduce such a model and describe its performance benefits through a combination of social and service simulations. We analyse the results by demonstrating gains in performance, quality of service, reduction of wasted jobs, and improvement of overall end-user experience.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Aware Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing Environments","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.33","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424958.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing Environments","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424958/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13272316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Aware Job Scheduling for Cloud Computing Environments","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064539S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6424959,"authors":[{"name":"Guilherme Galante","affiliation":["Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Galante","id":"37956146900"},{"name":"Luis Carlos E. de Bona","affiliation":["Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, PR, BR"],"firstName":"Luis Carlos E.","lastName":"de Bona","id":"37696684000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4432-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4862-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6424959","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":135,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2130},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Cloud Computing Elasticity","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424959.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.30","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elasticity","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Monitoring","Servers","Resource management","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing elasticity","computing paradigm","elasticity mechanism classification","commercial solution","academic solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","elasticity","survey"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424959","abstract":"Elasticity is a key feature in the cloud computing context, and perhaps what distinguishes this computing paradigm of the other ones, such as cluster and grid computing.

While cloud migration is an ongoing process, its base characteristics are not yet fully exploited. As Cloud Governance is built on top of requirements like security, reliability, trust, portability, interoperability, or fail over, a highly distributed and concurrent, and fault tolerant solution is required in order to achieve above specified requirements. This paper describes the core of an event-driven multi-agent architecture for supporting Cloud Governance activities, built around Akka/Clojure actor characteristics and fully exploiting the Enterprise Integration Patterns. The modeling process follows the Gaia methodology for agent-oriented analysis and design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Event Driven Multi-agent Architecture for Enabling Cloud Governance","doi":"10.1109/UCC.2012.50","endPage":"314","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423131/6424908/06424965.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing","startPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCC.2012.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424965","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Computer architecture","Protocols","Cloud computing","Multiagent systems","Safety","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","multi-agent systems","open systems","security of data","software agents","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven multiagent architecture","cloud governance activities","cloud adoption","IT-based industries","maturity levels","security","reliability","trust","portability","interoperability","fail over","fault tolerant solution","Akka-Clojure actor characteristics","enterprise integration patterns","Gaia methodology","agent-oriented analysis","agent-oriented design","cloud management","cloud computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud governance","cloud computing","Gaia methodology","multi-agent system","cloud management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Event Driven Multi-agent Architecture for Enabling Cloud Governance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424965/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13272323","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Event Driven Multi-agent Architecture for Enabling Cloud Governance","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4862a309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06336S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423131","isNumber":"6424908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423131","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6424908","articleId":"6424965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6424986,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jinyang","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering College, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Jinyang","id":"38547871300"},{"name":"Li Lijuan","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering College, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Lijuan","id":"37589482900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6424986","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"abstract":"It is hard to solve plane equations with exceptional points with a classical plane equation solving algorithm.

In order to overcome the defect that traditional SPL algorithms using directional transforms are not appropriate for any kind of images on account of their pre-specified property, we fully exploit PCA to train an orthonormal transformation matrix adapted to the content of image, and then use it do hard thresholding to replace the bivariate shrinkage existing in traditional methods. Since the orthonormal transformation matrix is adapted to the content of image, the process of hard thresholding can efficiently reduce noise and enforce the sparsity of image so as to improve the quality of reconstructed image. Experimental results reveal the proposed algorithm outperforms the SPL algorithms using directional transforms in aspect of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), although our proposed algorithm is a little slower than them.","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2012.6424994","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416128/6424977/06424994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2012.6424994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PCA-based smoothed projected Landweber algorithm for Block Compressed sensing image reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6424994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6424994/","displayDocTitle":"A PCA-based smoothed projected Landweber algorithm for Block Compressed sensing image reconstruction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13271702","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6424994/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PCA-based smoothed projected Landweber algorithm for Block Compressed sensing image reconstruction","confLoc":"Huangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"S115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083446S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416128","isNumber":"6424977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416128","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6424977","articleId":"6424994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6425010,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehua Li","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yuehua","lastName":"Li","id":"38547378100"},{"name":"Shunlan Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Shunlan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37835322000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6425010","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Quality of service","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Vectors","Block codes","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","interference suppression","linear codes","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","precoding","radiofrequency interference","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming-based multiuser quasiorthogonal space-time-frequency block coding scheme","QOSTFBC","zero multi-user interference beamforming","MIMO-OFDM","multiuser communication","multiuser interference elimination","linear constellation precoding","LCP advantage","full rate diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency coding","multiple input multiple output-orthogonal","frequency division multiplexing","beamforming","multi-user","linear constellation precoding"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-user quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency block coding scheme based beamforming","doi":"10.1109/IASP.2012.6425010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424977","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416128/6424977/06425010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2012.6425010","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425010","abstract":"This paper proposes a quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency block coding scheme (QOSTFBC) based zero multi-user interference beamforming in a MIMO-OFDM system.

The sparsity of the video frame varies over time, so the quality of the reconstruction from the fixed sampling rate framework will fluctuate. To solve this problem, we have proposed a new CS-Based video codec framework with the adaptive sampling rate, which is predicted by the test of intra-frame sparsity and inter-frame sparsity. The simulation and analysis have proven that the proposed framework has a better performance on the reconstruction than the fixed sampling rate framework.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video codecs","Transforms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Registers","Surveillance","Image reconstruction","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image coding","image reconstruction","image sampling","video codecs","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CS-based adaptive sampling rate surveillance video codec framework","compressed sensing","sparse signal recovery","Nyquist sampling theorem","video reconstruction","intraframe sparsity","interframe sparsity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","video compressive and coding","adaptive sampling rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IASP.2012.6425029","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416128/6424977/06425029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IASP.2012.6425029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CS-based adaptive sampling rate surveillance video codec framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CS-based adaptive sampling rate surveillance video codec framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425029/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425029/","accessionNumber":"13271736","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CS-based adaptive sampling rate surveillance video codec framework","confLoc":"Huangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"S250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038792S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416128","isNumber":"6424977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416128","xplore-issue":"6424977","articleId":"6425029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425039,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086728460"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-0110"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-0129"}],"articleNumber":"6425039","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Blind source separation","Independent component analysis","Entropy","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","independent component analysis","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FastICA algorithm","independent component analysis","blind signal separation","nonGaussian mixed-signal","negentropy","objective function","descendent Newton algorithm","sin signal","square signal","AM signal","FM signal","2FSK signal","performance index SNR","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FastICA","descendent Newton","Ostrowsky theorem"]}],"abstract":"Independent component analysis (ICA) is an effective method in the field of blind signal separation, which could separate the mixed-signal of the non-Gaussian.

Within the engine compartment of modern cars installation space is of major concern. Therefore small size and high integration level of the components are chances for automotive electronic control units. With novel integration of components into PCB technology new specific requirements are arising. Power electronics have to be placed close to the electric motor or - for hybrid electronic vehicles - close to the combustion engine.

This paper proposes a systematic method to select channel for better transmission performance. A fusion center (FC) is assumed to collect the channel information sent by SUs and decides the channel for the SU that issues the transmission request. The proposed schemes adopt the weight based concept to choose the appropriate channel for the SU. Two strategies, which are the egoistic approach and the cooperative approach, are proposed in this paper to maximize the individual transmission rate and overall system throughput, respectively. Exhaustive simulations were carried out to examine the performance of the proposed schemes.

We compare the performance of the proposed PDV filter with those of the existing sample minimum, mean, and maximum filters and observe that the sample-mode filtering algorithm is able to match or outperform other types of filters, at different levels of network load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6425166/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285976","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sample-mode packet delay variation filter for IEEE 1588 synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sample-mode packet delay variation filter for IEEE 1588 synchronization","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p1anyaegbu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054847S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6425171,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Yao Tsao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Yao Tsao","id":"38547002600"},{"name":"Pei-Yun Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pei-Yun Tsai","id":"37530250500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425171","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Modulation","Bit error rate","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Cooperative systems","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication links","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial cooperation scheme","MB-OFDM UWB system","hierarchical modulation","power efficiency","time-frequency plane","game theory","adaptability win-win solution","optimal power allocation coefficients","communication link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB-OFDM","UWB","cooperative communications","hierarchical modulation","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new cooperation scheme, i.e. partial cooperation, in MB-OFDM UWB systems for performance enhancement with high throughput and power efficiency. We first take advantage of the available subbands and design an efficient scheme in the time-frequency plane to deliver information bits to the relay node. Then, based on Game Theory, we propose to use hierarchical modulation, which is capable to offer adaptability and flexibilities to attract even a busy relay node that keeps its own communication link participating in cooperation. We also obtain the optimal power allocation coefficients for the proposed partial cooperation scheme. In addition, the optimal constellation priority parameter of hierarchical modulation is also evaluated. Both analytic and simulation results show that the proposed partial cooperation scheme not only achieves performance enhancement but also can upgrade system utilities of both links to get a win-win solution.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425171","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425171.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial cooperation in MB-OFDM UWB systems with hierarchical modulation and power allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425171/","displayDocTitle":"Partial cooperation in MB-OFDM UWB systems with hierarchical modulation and power allocation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425171/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial cooperation in MB-OFDM UWB systems with hierarchical modulation and power allocation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p226tsao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057693S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6425173,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chen Pao","affiliation":["ITRI, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wei-Chen Pao","id":"37540506000"},{"name":"Yung-Fang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Fang Chen","id":"37281032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425173","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Noise","Simulation","Indexes","Computational complexity","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","enhanced mechanism","constant power allocation methods","channel states","Big-Oh notation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","capacity","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"An enhanced mechanism is designed to improve the performance of the constant power allocation methods in OFDM systems.

Meanwhile, as the development of advanced cellular technologies, more than one component carrier (CC) can be jointly utilized in a base station (BS). As a result, the energy consumption of the BS has become an important concern. In this study, we thus propose a novel efficient power-saving scheme for the BS transmission to address the problem of the power minimization at BS transceiver subject to certain quality-of-service and fairness requirements for users. For this scheme, it is able to dynamically activate/deactivate CCs to utilize only the necessary power to enable energy-efficient data transmissions with the efficient control of the user fairness. In our model, activities in downlink data transmissions of a BS with multiple OFDMA-based CCs are considered, while concurrently supporting different types of users. Numerical results show that the total power consumption of our proposed scheme is significantly better than that of the case in which all CCs are always active when the traffic load is relatively light.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425175","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425175.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fairness-control-based power-saving transmission scheme in OFDMA-based multi-carrier data networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425175/","displayDocTitle":"A fairness-control-based power-saving transmission scheme in OFDMA-based multi-carrier data networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13285985","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425175/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fairness-control-based power-saving transmission scheme in OFDMA-based multi-carrier data networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p248chung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078319S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6425195,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Ta Yen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Ta Yen","id":"37593999600"},{"name":"Wen-Bin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Bin Chen","id":"38548654200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425195","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"abstract":"This study proposes a new inter-vehicle communication (IVC) system based on optical spectral-amplitude-coding optical code division multiple access (SACOCDMA) systems architecture, then, analysis and calculate the system's performance by using analytic and simulation methods.

The principal advantages of the Ultra Tightly Couple (UTC) structure is that a Doppler frequency derived from the INS is integrated with the tracking loops to improve the receiver tracking capability. The Doppler frequency shift is calculated and fed to the GPS tracking loops for elimination of the effect of stochastic errors caused by the Doppler frequency. The navigation information from INS can be converted into the Doppler information, which can be integrated with the GPS tracking loops to mitigate the Doppler on the GPS signal, resulting in the threshold improvement, thereby improving the overall system performance.

The major challenge of the research is to label whether a pattern is dangerous or not for training data. Our approach is to recognize the seven behaviors, normal driving, acceleration, deceleration, changing to the left lane or right lane, zigzag driving, and approaching the car in front by hidden Markov models. The danger-level indicator, on behalf of the dangerous situation of drivers, is inferred by fuzzy rules involved with the above behaviors. The higher the value represents the worse status of drivers, and it also provides three colors representing different levels of warnings to remind drivers of their own states. The uncertain definition of a dangerous pattern is avoided, and the related behaviors leading to the current danger level are offered instead. Moreover, unlike many studies using simulators to validate their systems and experimental results, we collected data from a real vehicle and evaluated the proposed system in a real road environment. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an average detection ratio of 95% for behavior recognition and can be used for driving safety.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic based driving behavior monitoring using hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425217","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425217.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based driving behavior monitoring using hidden Markov models","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425217/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286027","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based driving behavior monitoring using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p447wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047095S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6425240,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Cheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Che-Cheng Chang","id":"37087763391"},{"name":"Jichiang Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jichiang Tsai","id":"37087331722"},{"name":"Shi-Jia Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shi-Jia Pei","id":"37087764277"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Particle swarm optimization","Trajectory","Convergence","Mathematical model","Quantum computing","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","control system synthesis","convergence","feedback","optimal control","particle swarm optimisation","stability","steering systems","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum particle swarm optimization","QPSO algorithm","feedback control","semi-autonomous driver assistance systems","automotive technology","senior drivers","control design method","steering support","optimal feedback gain","tracking control","convergence time","quantum computing","trajectory tracking","stabilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["driver assistance system","particle swarm optimization","quantum computing","quantum particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"With the aging of the population, the development of automotive technology has become increasingly important for preventing car accident caused by senior drivers. As a basic research of driver assistance system for senior drivers, we propose a novel control design method for steering support. In this method, we consider the stability and limitation of a system, so that senior drivers can driver more safely and comfortably. In the context, we first use a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method to search the optimal feedback gain under constraints for achieving tracking control. Moreover, to reduce the convergence time further, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is combined with quantum computing for the purpose. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed feedback controller based on the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is capable of providing satisfactory computational performance for the trajectory tracking and stabilization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425240","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425240.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"557","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantum PSO algorithm for feedback control of semi-autonomous driver assistance systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A quantum PSO algorithm for feedback control of semi-autonomous driver assistance systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6425240/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286050","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantum PSO algorithm for feedback control of semi-autonomous driver assistance systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p553chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045699S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6425250,"authors":[{"name":"Keshav Singh","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Keshav","lastName":"Singh","id":"38548448300"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Meng-Lin Ku","id":"37602473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425250","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Equalizers","Bit error rate","Antennas","Fading","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","equalisers","error statistics","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power allocation","MMSE equalizer designs","MIMO distributed relay networks","multiple relay nodes","minimum mean-square error criterion","total equalizer power constraint","multi-input multi-output equalizers","iterative algorithm","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions","intersymbol interference","ISI","multipath diversity gains","spatial multipath diversity gains","BER performance","bit error rate performance","conventional one-tap equalizer scheme","time domain analysis","multiple antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks","equalization","minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)","multipath fading channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we jointly investigate the power allocation and the equalizer weights for multiple relay nodes in a distributed relay network where each node is equipped with multiple antennas. Based on the minimum mean-square error (MSE) criterion and under the total equalizer power constraint, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) equalizers are designed for equalizing-and-forwarding the signals from the source to the destination in the time domain. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (K.K.T.) conditions. With these optimal MIMO equalizers, the MIMO distributed relay network can effectively mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and achieve both the spatial and multipath diversity gains.

For noncoherent block-coded MPSK over continuous channels, rotating signal points of an entire codeword, such that the first symbol is the same as the last symbol of previously transmitted codeword and thus can be omitted, increase bandwidth efficiency. This method is called generalized differential encoding. Since noncoherent block-coded QAM/TAPSK proposed before cannot be applied to generalized differential encoding, in this paper, we modify the definition of noncoherent block-coded QAM/TAPSK and the bit labeling of signal points. Simulations of various examples of noncoherent block-coded QAM/TAPSK with generalized differential encoding are made and discussed as well. We find that if the block length is very small than 8, NBC-16TAPSK performs better than NBC-16QAM due to its large minimum noncoherent distance. However, if the block is longer than 8, NBC-16QAM has better error performance because the codewords with small noncoherent distances are rare.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425270","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425270.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","startPage":"689","endPage":"693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-coded 16TAPSK and 16QAM for generalized differential encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block-coded 16TAPSK and 16QAM for generalized differential encoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425270/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286080","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425270/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-coded 16TAPSK and 16QAM for generalized differential encoding","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p689lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043189S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6425272,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Ching Fu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Ching Fu","id":"38529144100"},{"name":"Ming-Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Jun Yang","id":"38547170100"},{"name":"Yung-Fang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Fang Chen","id":"37281032000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3070-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3071-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3068-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3069-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425272","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wiener filters","Detectors","Noise","Vectors","OFDM","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","adaptive signal detection","antenna arrays","cognitive radio","fading","interference suppression","matched filters","radio spectrum management","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistage Wiener filter","constant false alarm rate","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","primary user signal detection","multipath fading","multiantenna technique","secondary user","general sidelode canceller","GSC","interference suppression","noise suppression","adaptive matched filter","CFAR detector","reduced-rank processing","AMF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","spectrum sensing","multistage Wiener filter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a reduced-rank multistage Wiener filter based constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is applied for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio.

In order to enhance the performance of primary user signal detection under the multipath fading environment, a multiple antenna technique is employed at the secondary user. In addition, the general sidelode canceller (GSC) is utilized prior to the detection to suppress the effect of interference and noise. And then the adaptive matched filter (AMF) CFAR detector is employed for the secondary user.

The first part use the rotation concept to estimate the initial Carrier Frequecy Offset (CFO) and design the time domain equalizer. The second part make use of iterative concept to find the true frequency peak for better estimate. The proposed scheme does not require initial random guess as regular iterative algorithms, in which may suffer from the problem of the convergence to the local maximum.

The performance of this technique depends mainly on the accuracy in channel frequency response (CFR) estimation. Most high performance channel estimation schemes exploit the correlation of the CFRs of subchannels which rely on the knowledge of channel statistics. There are also some model-based methods which are relatively simple in implementation and less dependent of the CFR correlation. However, the proposed model-based methods, applicable to OFDM systems with periodic training blocks, are less spectrally efficient comparing to those with scattered pilots. In this work, we consider the scenario of the OFDM systems with scattered pilots, the model-based method is modified and incorporated with a decision-directed feedback procedure. The proposed scheme achieves improved performance comparing to the traditional model-based methods using scattered pilots.

Because of the time-varying feature of angles of arrival (AoAs), angles of departure (AoDs), and LoS angle, the proposed GBSM has the ability to investigate the non-stationarity of HST environment caused by the high speed movement of the receiver. From the proposed model, the local spatial cross-correlation function (CCF) and the local temporal autocorrelation (ACF) are derived for different taps.

Therefore, a great deal of channel estimation schemes have been proposed, e.g., by adding postamble, inserting midambles, and turning the phase tracking pilots into channel estimation pilots. However, most of them necessitate a modification of either the packet structure or the basic function of pilots, resulting in an incompatibility with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based IEEE 802.11p standard. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a novel effective channel estimation scheme without the aforementioned modification. In specific, in the proposed scheme, we first utilize the data symbols to construct pilots and then exploit the correlated characteristic between channels within two adjacent symbols to improve the accuracy of the channel estimates. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms all current ones especially in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415494/6425142/06425306.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2012.6425306","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2012.6425306","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425306","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Estimation","OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","demodulation","equalisers","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation scheme","vehicle-to-vehicle communication","V2V communication","demodulation","equalization","V2V channels","time-varying characteristic","phase tracking pilots","packet structure","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","IEEE 802.11p standard","data symbols","adjacent symbols","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR regime"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425306/","displayDocTitle":"A novel effective channel estimation scheme applicable to IEEE 802.11p","accessionNumber":"13286116","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6425306/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel effective channel estimation scheme applicable to IEEE 802.11p","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p88zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090525S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415494","isNumber":"6425142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415494","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6425142","articleId":"6425306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6425372,"authors":[{"name":"Milosav Andelic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Milosav","lastName":"Andelic","id":"38666994900"},{"name":"Stevan Berber","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Berber","id":"37266150700"},{"name":"Akshya Swain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Akshya","lastName":"Swain","id":"37294907500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6425372","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"abstract":"This letter presents Collaborative Event Driven Energy Efficient Protocol (CEDEEP) that assures energy efficient operation of one-hop event driven Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).

However, concerns of sensitive information on cloud potentially causes privacy problems. Data encryption protects data security to some extent, but at the cost of compromised efficiency. Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows retrieval of encrypted data over cloud. In this paper, we focus on addressing data privacy issues using SSE. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue from the aspect of similarity relevance and scheme robustness. We observe that server-side ranking based on order-preserving encryption (OPE) inevitably leaks data privacy. To eliminate the leakage, we propose a two-round searchable encryption (TRSE) scheme that supports top-k multikeyword retrieval. In TRSE, we employ a vector space model and homomorphic encryption. The vector space model helps to provide sufficient search accuracy, and the homomorphic encryption enables users to involve in the ranking while the majority of computing work is done on the server side by operations only on ciphertext. As a result, information leakage can be eliminated and data security is ensured. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security and practical efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Secure Multikeyword Top-k Retrieval over Encrypted Cloud Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2013.9","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/6549100/06425381.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2013.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6549100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Toward Secure Multikeyword Top-k Retrieval over Encrypted Cloud Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2013","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13599306","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Secure Multikeyword Top-k Retrieval over Encrypted Cloud Data","sourcePdf":"ttq2013040239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044043S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2013","isNumber":"6549100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"87","articleId":"6425381","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6425391,"authors":[{"name":"Melba M.

To be effective, classification must rely on the most informative pixels, while the training set should be as compact as possible. Active learning heuristics provide capability to select unlabeled data that are the \u201cmost informative\u201d and to obtain the respective labels, contributing to both goals. Characteristics of remotely sensed image data provide both challenges and opportunities to exploit the potential advantages of active learning. We present an overview of active learning methods, then review the latest techniques proposed to cope with the problem of interactive sampling of training pixels for classification of remotely sensed data with support vector machines (SVMs). We discuss remote sensing specific approaches dealing with multisource and spatially and time-varying data, and provide examples for high-dimensional hyperspectral imagery.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2012.2231951","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/6461951/06425391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2012.2231951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461951","startPage":"593","endPage":"608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Learning: Any Value for Classification of Remotely Sensed Data?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425391","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Learning: Any Value for Classification of Remotely Sensed Data?","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"101","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13324019","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425391/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Learning: Any Value for Classification of Remotely Sensed Data?","sourcePdf":"jproc-tuia-2231951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11567S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6461951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6461951","articleId":"6425391","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425416,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Huang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6511996/6425416/6425416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Huang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in radio physics from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2010.","After his graduation, he joined Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, USA, as a Senior Engineer in 2010.

The inferred word alignments are compared against EM and variational Bayes (VB) inference in terms of their end-to-end translation performance on several language pairs and types of corpora up to 15 million sentence pairs. We show that Bayesian inference outperforms both EM and VB in the majority of test cases. Further analysis reveals that the proposed method effectively addresses the high-fertility rare word problem in EM and unaligned rare word problem in VB, achieves higher agreement and vocabulary coverage rates than both, and leads to smaller phrase tables.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6428687/06425427.pdf","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Statistical Machine Translation Using Bayesian Word Alignment and Gibbs Sampling","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2013.2244087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2013.2244087","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Improving Statistical Machine Translation Using Bayesian Word Alignment and Gibbs Sampling","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13551587","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6425427/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Statistical Machine Translation Using Bayesian Word Alignment and Gibbs Sampling","sourcePdf":"tasl-mermer-2244087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097308S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6428687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6428687","articleId":"6425427","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425434,"authors":[{"name":"KwangSeok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6484888/6425434/6425434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["KwangSeok Kim (S'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (summa cum laude) from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009.

The proposed generator, referred to as a \u201c2nd-order PWM signal generator\u201d in this paper, utilizes a double integration loop based upon the concept of delta-sigma modulation for precise conversion. A simple 2nd-order PWM signal generator was initially investigated, but it was found to exhibit impractical behavior: the period of the PWM output signal increased slowly with time. An analysis of the limit cycle state of this simple generator using describing function theory shows that the amplitude of the limit cycle is extremely large. Proportional integral (PI) compensation is therefore used to adjust the limit cycle state by varying the proportional gain and the coefficient of the integral. The use of PI compensation suppresses the amplitude of the limit cycle, thus making the 2nd-order PWM signal generator practical. An analysis of this modified generator reveals that the period of the PWM signal can be controlled by the hysteresis width of the comparator and by the proportional gain. As a test case, a switching frequency of 300 kHz is used for the performance evaluation of the proposed PWM signal generator with a sampling frequency of 12.5 MHz. A noise-shaped output is obtained, and a high-precision, ultra-low-distortion PWM signal with a high effective duty cycle resolution is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425439/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13786050","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Self-Oscillating PWM Signal Generator With a Double Integration Loop","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Self-Oscillating PWM Signal Generator With a Double Integration Loop","sourcePdf":"tcsi-li-2239177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097455S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6567958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6567958","articleId":"6425439","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6425440,"authors":[{"name":"David Ger\u00f3nimo","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center and the Department of Computer Science, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["David Ger\u00f3nimo received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and M.Sc. degree and Ph.D. degree (with honors) in computer vision from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Cerdanyola, Spain, in 2004, 2006, and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher and Associate Lecturer with the Computer Science Department, UAB, and the Computer Vision Center.

The DOB is designed in the form of a second-order high-pass filter in order to estimate the disturbance. The nonlinear controller is designed for position tracking as a near input-output linearizing inner-loop load pressure controller and a backstepping outer-loop position controller. Variable structure control is implemented in order to compensate for the error in disturbance estimation.

Thus far, many PU methods with high accuracy have been proposed. However, the limitation of computer's memory requirement is ignored in the design of most of these methods. To effectively solve this problem, a fast PU method for large-scale interferograms is proposed in this paper. With this method, a large-scale interferogram is first partitioned into small tiles according to a strategy based on the residue clustering characteristics, which is the extension and improvement of our previous work. The new tiling strategy has a significant advantage over our earlier work, since it can exactly ensure the consistency between local and global PU results of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n-norm criterion. In order to solve the dilemma that high execution speed and high accuracy cannot be satisfied at the same time, which is usually encountered in practice, each tile will be independently unwrapped by minimum-spanning-tree-based PU method either in parallel or in series after tiling processing. By comparing between two representative large-scale PU methods (the SNAPHU method proposed by Chen and Zebker and a large-scale minimum-cost flow method supplied by GAMMA software), it can be seen that the proposed approach is not only efficient in solving large-scale PU problems but also effective in avoiding the inconsistency between local and global PU results generated by image tiling.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2229284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6544624/06425454.pdf","startPage":"4240","endPage":"4248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2229284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6544624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Phase Unwrapping Method for Large-Scale Interferograms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425454/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Phase Unwrapping Method for Large-Scale Interferograms","volume":"51","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13595944","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425454/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Phase Unwrapping Method for Large-Scale Interferograms","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yu-2229284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114241S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6544624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6544624","articleId":"6425454","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6425457,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA","United Technologies Research Center, East Hartford, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6480818/6425457/6425457-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Jiang (S'05\u2013M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

The modulation in the motor drive terminals serves as the CM noise source. A few improved PWM methods could reduce the CM voltage amplitude in comparison with the conventional space vector PWM and discontinuous PWM. However, some harmonics of the improved PWM methods increase when considering the spectrum. Because the CM loop of the motor drive system is an L-R-C circuit which has its resonant frequency, the CM noise current is highly influenced by the noise near the resonant frequency. This paper studies the CM current with different PWM methods and claims that the design of PWM methods and switching frequency should be together with the CM loop impedance. Reduced CM voltage does not mean reduced CM current. With a CM choke to attenuate the CM noise, the choke size is determined by the CM volt-seconds on the choke. This paper studies the general case and the worst case of the choke size. The conclusions are supported by simulation and experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6480818/06425457.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2013.2243394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2013.2243394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6480818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM Impact on CM Noise and AC CM Choke for Variable-Speed Motor Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Inductors","Motor drives","Resonant frequency","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics suppression","inductors","PWM invertors","switching convertors","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertor","AC CM choke","variable speed motor drive","pulsewidth modulation","common mode noise current","CM noise source","harmonics suppression","L R C circuit","resonant frequency","switching frequency","CM loop impedance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode (CM)","impedance","inverter","motor drive","pulsewidth modulation (PWM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"PWM Impact on CM Noise and AC CM Choke for Variable-Speed Motor Drives","volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6425457/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2013","accessionNumber":"13370053","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM Impact on CM Noise and AC CM Choke for Variable-Speed Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tia-jiang-2243394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100624S","chronDate":"March-April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6480818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6480818","articleId":"6425457","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425468,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Faheem Zobaa","affiliation":["Cairo University, Giza, Egypt","School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6563218/6425468/6425468-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Faheem Zobaa (M'02\u2013SM'04) received the B.Sc.(Hons.), M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees from Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, in 1992, 1997, and 2002, respectively, all in electrical power and machines.","From 2007 to 2010, he was a Senior Lecturer in renewable energy with the University of Exeter, Penryn, U.K. He was also an Instructor from 1992 to 1997, a Teaching Assistant from 1997 to 2002, and an Assistant Professor from 2003 to April 2008 with the Department of Electrical Power and Machines and the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, where he has also been an Associate Professor since April 2008.

This paper suggests a new approach for the optimal sizing of hybrid active power filter (HAPF) parameters, which is presented for three-phase industrial power systems. Hybrid filter topology can be used to compensate harmonic currents, as well as for power factor corrections, without concern for importing and exporting harmonics, or simply the series and parallel resonance that may occur. The new trend in harmonic power filter design is not to obtain the best solution from a single objective optimization but to obtain a good compromise solution accomplished under other conflicting objectives. Fortran Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming is used to determine the proposed filter optimal sizing to minimize the total voltage harmonic distortion as the main objective function, where maintaining the load power factor at an acceptable limit is desired. If the total harmonic voltage distortion achieves the specified goal, then the objective is redirected into minimizing the resultant voltage and current total harmonic distortions. The optimal design of the HAPF is analyzed by means of three case studies.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2244539","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2244539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6563218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6563218/06425468.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal multiobjective design of hybrid active power filters considering a distorted environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425468/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal multiobjective design of hybrid active power filters considering a distorted environment","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6425468/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13694151","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal multiobjective design of hybrid active power filters considering a distorted environment","sourcePdf":"tie-zobaa-2244539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107858S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6563218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6563218","articleId":"6425468","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6425487,"authors":[{"name":"Mansik Jeon","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea","Department of Biomedical Engineering, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6558949/6425487/6425487-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mansik Jeon received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea in 2011.

Unfortunately, owing to unavoidable strong light scattering in biological tissues, such methods cannot maintain contrast and spatial resolution beyond one optical transport mean free path ( ~ 1 mm in tissues). Although model-based diffuse optical tomography is able to operate at greater depths, this technique fails to maintain spatial resolution. Photoacoustic tomography overcomes the fundamental penetration depth problem and achieves high-resolution optical imaging in deep tissues by combing light and ultrasound. In this review article, the multimodal imaging capability of photoacoustic tomography, integrated with existing imaging tools, is contemplated and the potential preclinical and clinical impacts of the combined systems are discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2244203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6558949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6558949/06425487.pdf","endPage":"982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Photoacoustic Tomography","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2244203","startPage":"975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Photoacoustic Tomography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425487/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13735923","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425487/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Photoacoustic Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmm-kim-2244203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121613S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6558949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6558949","articleId":"6425487","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6425489,"authors":[{"name":"Cesare Alippi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6462010/6425489/6425489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cesare Alippi (S'92\u2013M'97\u2013\u201dSM'99\u2013F'06) received the degree (cum laude) in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1990 and 1995, respectively.","He is currently a Full Professor of information processing systems with the Politecnico di Milano.

In stationary conditions, a JIT classifier improves its accuracy over time by exploiting additional supervised information coming from the field. In nonstationary conditions, however, the classifier reacts as soon as concept drift is detected; the current classification setup is discarded and a suitable one activated to keep the accuracy high. We present a novel generation of JIT classifiers able to deal with recurrent concept drift by means of a practical formalization of the concept representation and the definition of a set of operators working on such representations. The concept-drift detection activity, which is crucial in promptly reacting to changes exactly when needed, is advanced by considering change-detection tests monitoring both inputs and classes distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2239309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2239309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462010","startPage":"620","endPage":"634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6462010/06425489.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Monitoring","Training","Accuracy","Vectors","Probability density function","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","just-in-time","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["just-in-time classifiers","instance classification","JIT classifier","supervised information","nonstationary conditions","current classification setup","recurrent concept drift","concept representation","concept-drift detection activity","change-detection test monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive classifiers","concept drift","just-in-time classifiers","recurrent concepts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Just-In-Time Classifiers for Recurrent Concepts","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13324045","pubMedId":"24808382","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425489/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425489/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just-In-Time Classifiers for Recurrent Concepts","sourcePdf":"tnnls-boracchi-2239309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101068S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6462010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6462010","articleId":"6425489","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6425491,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hui Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6513254/6425491/6425491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi-Hui Wang (M\u201909) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in automation, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2003, 2006, and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor at the College of Automation, Chongqing University.

To realize the proposed model, the differential equation of the primary resonant current under the free resonant mode was used. Besides, real-time sampled data, including the operating frequency in the free resonant mode and peak value of the primary resonant current were collected.

In our previous research, the problem of diagnosing multiple faults over time (dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD)) is solved based on a sequence of test outcomes by assuming that the faults and their time evolution are independent. This problem is NP-hard, and, consequently, we developed a polynomial approximation algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation within a FHMM framework. Here, we extend this formulation to a mixed memory Markov coupling model, termed dynamic coupled fault diagnosis (DCFD) problem, to determine the most likely sequence of (dependent) fault states, the one that best explains the observed test outcomes over time. An iterative Gauss-Seidel coordinate ascent optimization method is proposed for solving the DCFD problem. A soft Viterbi algorithm is also implemented within the framework for decoding-dependent fault states over time. We demonstrate the algorithm on simulated systems with coupled faults and the results show that this approach improves the correct isolation rate (CI) as compared to the formulation where independent fault states (DMFD) are assumed. As a by-product, we show empirically that, while diagnosing for independent faults, the DMFD algorithm based on block coordinate ascent method, although it does not provide a measure of suboptimality, provides better primal cost and higher CI than the Lagrangian relaxation method for independent fault case. Two real-world examples (a hybrid electric vehicle, and a mobile autonomous robot) with coupled faults are also used to evaluate the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221021/6497536/06425502.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Factorial Hidden Markov Models (CFHMM) for Diagnosing Multiple and Coupled Faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425502/","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Factorial Hidden Markov Models (CFHMM) for Diagnosing Multiple and Coupled Faults","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13431049","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425502/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Factorial Hidden Markov Models (CFHMM) for Diagnosing Multiple and Coupled Faults","sourcePdf":"tsmc-kodali-2210405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094357S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6497536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6497536","articleId":"6425502","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6425503,"authors":[{"name":"Pratyusha Rakshit","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/6530659/6425503/6425503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pratyusha Rakshit received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management, Salt Lake, India, in 2010, and the M.E. degree in control engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2012, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the identification of protein and gene regulatory networks to control neuronal firing in mammals.","She is the author of over 15 papers published in top international journals and conference proceedings.

An adaptive MA (AMA) incorporates an adaptive selection of memes (units of cultural transmission) from a meme pool to improve the cultural characteristics of the individual member of a population-based search algorithm. This paper presents a novel approach to design an AMA by utilizing the composite benefits of differential evolution (DE) for global search and Q-learning for local refinement. Four variants of DE, including the currently best self-adaptive DE algorithm, have been used here to study the relative performance of the proposed AMA with respect to runtime, cost function evaluation, and accuracy (offset in cost function from the theoretical optimum after termination of the algorithm). Computer simulations performed on a well-known set of 25 benchmark functions reveal that incorporation of Q-learning in one popular and one outstanding variants of DE makes the corresponding algorithm more efficient in both runtime and accuracy. The performance of the proposed AMA has been studied on a real-time multirobot path-planning problem. Experimental results obtained for both simulation and real frameworks indicate that the proposed algorithm-based path-planning scheme outperforms the real-coded genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and DE, particularly its currently best version with respect two standard metrics defined in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425503/","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6425503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13563831","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Realization of an Adaptive Memetic Algorithm Using Differential Evolution and Q-Learning: A Case Study in Multirobot Path Planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of an Adaptive Memetic Algorithm Using Differential Evolution and Q-Learning: A Case Study in Multirobot Path Planning","sourcePdf":"tsmc-konar-2226024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158588S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6530659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6530659","articleId":"6425503","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6425517,"authors":[{"name":"Du\u0161ko Karaklaji\u0107","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Du\u0161ko Karaklaji\u0107 received the degree in electrical engineering from University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 2008.

This creates an extra design concern for a hardware designer.

Existing user selection algorithms such as zero forcing with selection (ZFS) have the flaws of \u201credundant users\u201d and \u201clocal optimum,\u201d which compromise the achieved sum rate. GUSS improves the performance by adding the \u201cdelete\u201d and \u201cswap\u201d operations to the user selection procedure of ZFS to eliminate \u201credundant users\u201d and escape from \u201clocal optimum,\u201d respectively. In addition, an effective-channel-vector-based effective-channel-gain-updating scheme is proposed to reduce the complexity of GUSS. With the help of this updating scheme, GUSS has the same order of complexity as ZFS with only a linear increment. Simulation results indicate that over the range of transmit signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) considered, on average, the sum rate of GUSS reaches 99.3% of the upper bound that is achieved by exhaustive search, with only 1.51 to 2.29 times the complexity of ZFS.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2244105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6595631/06425521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2244105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595631","startPage":"3084","endPage":"3097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767566","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425521/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Selection for Multiuser MIMO Downlink With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2244105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115465S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6595631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6595631","articleId":"6425521","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6425523,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Hashem Eiza","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6425523/6425523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahmoud Hashem Eiza received the B.Sc. degree in engineering informatics from Damascus University, Damascus, Syria, in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in data communication systems from Brunel University, London, U.K., in 2010.

The conventional routing protocols proposed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) work poorly in VANETs. As communication links break more frequently in VANETs than in MANETs, the routing reliability of such highly dynamic networks needs to be paid special attention. To date, very little research has focused on the routing reliability of VANETs on highways. In this paper, we use the evolving graph theory to model the VANET communication graph on a highway. The extended evolving graph helps capture the evolving characteristics of the vehicular network topology and determines the reliable routes preemptively. This paper is the first to propose an evolving graph-based reliable routing scheme for VANETs to facilitate quality-of-service (QoS) support in the routing process. A new algorithm is developed to find the most reliable route in the VANET evolving graph from the source to the destination. We demonstrate, through the simulation results, that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms the related protocols in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2244625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06425523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2244625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","startPage":"1493","endPage":"1504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolving Graph-Based Reliable Routing Scheme for VANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Evolving Graph-Based Reliable Routing Scheme for VANETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487060","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6425523/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolving Graph-Based Reliable Routing Scheme for VANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-ni-2244625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080789S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6425523","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6425529,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Sheng Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education of Design and Electromagnetic Compatibility of High-Speed Electronic Systems, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6472304/6425529/6425529-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin-Sheng Wu (S'09\u2013M'10) was born in 1981.

These networks are comprised of heterogeneous sets of nodes and edges that better represent the different entities and relationships often found in the real world. Although heterogeneous networks provide a richer semantic view of the data, the added complexity makes it difficult to directly apply existing techniques that work well on homogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a graph modification process that alters an existing heterogeneous bibliographic network into another network, with the purpose of highlighting the important relations in the bibliographic network. Several importance scores, some adopted from existing work and others defined in this work, are then used to measure the importance of links in the modified network. The link prediction problem is studied on the modified network by implementing a random walk-based algorithm on the network. The importance scores and the structure of the modified graph are used to guide a random walker towards relevant parts of the graph, i.e. towards nodes to which new links will be created in the future. The different properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated experimentally on a real world bibliographic network, the DBLP. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised technique as well as various approaches based on topology and node attributes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425726/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425726/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13287131","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Link Prediction in a Modified Heterogeneous Bibliographic Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link Prediction in a Modified Heterogeneous Bibliographic Network","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4799a442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082473S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423126","isNumber":"6425553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423126","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6425553","articleId":"6425726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425732,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos E.

However, today Internet security is a quickly growing concern. The prevalence of Internet attacks has increased significantly, but still the challenge of detecting such attacks generally falls on the end hosts and service providers, requiring system administrators to detect and block attacks on their own. In particular, as social networks have become central hubs of information and communication, they are increasingly the target of attention and attacks. This creates a challenge of carefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones. Previous work has shown that for a variety of Internet attacks, there is a small subset of connection measurements that are good indicators of whether a connection is part of an attack or not. In this paper we look at the effectiveness of using two different co-clustering algorithms to both cluster connections as well as mark which connection measurements are strong indicators of what makes any given cluster anomalous relative to the total data set. We run experiments with these co-clustering algorithms on the KDD 1999 Cup data set. In our experiments we find that soft co-clustering, running on samples of data, finds consistent parameters that are strong indicators of anomalous detections and creates clusters, that are highly pure. When running hard co-clustering on the full data set (over 100 runs), we on average have one cluster with 92.44% attack connections and the other with 75.84% normal connections. These results are on par with the KDD 1999 Cup winning entry, showing that co-clustering is a strong, unsupervised method for separating normal connections from anomalous ones. Finally, we believe that the ideas presented in this work may inspire research for anomaly detection in social networks, such as identifying spammers and fraudsters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection Using Co-clustering","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2012.72","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/6423126/6425553/06425732.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2012.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Network Anomaly Detection Using Co-clustering","conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425732/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13287137","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Anomaly Detection Using Co-clustering","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4799a403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065501S","chronDate":"26-29 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6423126","isNumber":"6425553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6423126","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6425553","articleId":"6425732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425790,"authors":[{"name":"Ozer Ozdikis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozer","lastName":"Ozdikis","id":"37888799400"},{"name":"Pinar Senkul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Pinar","lastName":"Senkul","id":"37670318600"},{"name":"Halit Oguztuzun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Halit","lastName":"Oguztuzun","id":"37299534100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2497-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4799-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6425790","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Semantics","Twitter","Event detection","Clustering algorithms","Ontologies","Radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","pattern clustering","social networking (online)","statistical analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lexico-semantic expansion technique","tweet contents","event detection method enhancement","Twitter","microblogging platform","document similarity algorithm","document clustering algorithm","length limitations","idiosyncratic spelling","syntagmatic relationships","paradigmatic relationships","word similarities","cooccurrence statistics","Turkey"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event Detection","Clustering","Micro-blogging","Twitter","Tweets in Turkish","Semantics","Word Co-occurrences"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425790","abstract":"This paper aims to enhance event detection methods in a micro-blogging platform, namely Twitter. The enhancement technique we propose is based on lexico-semantic expansion of tweet contents while applying document similarity and clustering algorithms. Considering the length limitations and idiosyncratic spelling in Twitter environment, it is possible to take advantage of word similarities and to enrich texts with similar words. The semantic expansion technique we implement is based on syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships between words, extracted from their co-occurrence statistics.

In this scheme, a number of networked agents cooperate in locating the optimum of the sum of their individual objective functions. Each agent has access only to its own objective function and its neighbors' estimates of the collective optimum. Under mild assumptions, we derive explicit expressions for a lower bound on the algorithm's convergence rate and an upper bound on the agents' ultimate estimation error, in terms of relevant problem parameters. We build on the analytic techniques we previously introduced, in which we treat the evolution of the mean and deviation of agents' estimates as two coupled dynamic subsystems, and provide a Lyapunov argument for the practical asymptotic stability of their interconnection. More generally, this approach turns out to be useful in deriving sharper convergence results under weaker assumptions in the continuous-time case, as well as in providing an elegant way to account for the effects of positive projections that might need to be employed by each agent in some applications. Finally, we propose an application of this scheme to the design of fully decentralized dual resource allocation algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A continuous-time decentralized optimization scheme with positivity constraints","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425817","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425817.pdf","startPage":"6801","endPage":"6807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A continuous-time decentralized optimization scheme with positivity constraints","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425817/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288466","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A continuous-time decentralized optimization scheme with positivity constraints","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074522S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6425819,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Mahajan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, McGill University, Canada"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Mahajan","id":"37299779700"},{"name":"Nuno C.

It is desirable in these systems to limit the sensor and control computation and/or communication to instances when the system needs attention. However, classical sampled-data control is based on performing sensing and actuation periodically rather than when the system needs attention. This paper provides an introduction to event- and self-triggered control systems where sensing and actuation is performed when needed. Event-triggered control is reactive and generates sensor sampling and control actuation when, for instance, the plant state deviates more than a certain threshold from a desired value. Self-triggered control, on the other hand, is proactive and computes the next sampling or actuation instance ahead of time. The basics of these control strategies are introduced together with a discussion on the differences between state feedback and output feedback for event-triggered control. It is also shown how event- and self-triggered control can be implemented using existing wireless communication technology. Some applications to wireless control in process industry are discussed as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425820/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13288468","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6425820/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to event-triggered and self-triggered control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to event-triggered and self-triggered control","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126177S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"816","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6425851,"authors":[{"name":"Ion Necoara","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Systems Engineering Department, Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Necoara","id":"37299149400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425851","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Convergence","Tin","Linear programming","Stability criteria","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","computational complexity","discrete systems","distributed control","iterative methods","linear systems","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal distributed MPC","block-coordinate descent method","stability guarantees","feasibility guarantees","discrete linear model predictive control problems","general networked systems","iteration complexity","convex objective functions","distributed optimization method","zero terminal state","terminal cost formulation","distributed invariance conditions","closed-loop interconnected system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425851","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425851.pdf","startPage":"4480","endPage":"4485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suboptimal distributed MPC based on a block-coordinate descent method with feasibility and stability guarantees","abstract":"In this paper we propose a distributed optimization algorithm to solving discrete linear model predictive control (MPC) problems for general networked systems. The new optimization algorithm is based on block coordinate descent updates in parallel with very simple iteration complexity and using only local information. We show that for smooth objective functions it has sublinear rate of convergence, while for strongly convex objective functions it converges linearly. An MPC controller based on this distributed optimization method is derived, for which every subsystem in the network can compute feasible and stabilizing control inputs using distributed computations. For ensuring stability of the MPC scheme, we use a terminal cost formulation and we eliminate the need for a zero terminal state, which proves to be less conservative than some terminal cost - terminal set approaches. We provide a distributed synthesis for a terminal cost, which satisfy distributed invariance conditions for the whole system and guarantees stability of the closed-loop interconnected system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6425851/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288497","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Suboptimal distributed MPC based on a block-coordinate descent method with feasibility and stability guarantees","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suboptimal distributed MPC based on a block-coordinate descent method with feasibility and stability guarantees","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064094S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6425857,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Ribeiro","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37393452400"},{"name":"Don Towsley","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Towsley","id":"37272331500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"Estimating characteristics of large graphs via sampling is vital in the study of complex networks.

This extends and generalizes recent results in the literature pertaining to arms evolving as two-state Markov chains.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of myopic policy for a class of monotone affine restless multi-armed bandits","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425858","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425858.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of myopic policy for a class of monotone affine restless multi-armed bandits","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425858/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288503","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of myopic policy for a class of monotone affine restless multi-armed bandits","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064629S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6425863,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Hou","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Hou","id":"38004156000"},{"name":"Gangfeng Yan","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gangfeng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37273010500"},{"name":"Zhiyun Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia","College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403766800"},{"name":"Wenyuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Wenyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37577495000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425863","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Synchronization","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","synchronisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed transmit beamforming","feedback based intercluster synchronization","optimal transmit beamforming","wireless sensor correlation","turn distributed beamforming","partial global knowledge","random grouping distributed beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","distributed sensors","cooperative communication","optimization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed transmit beamforming via feedback-based inter-cluster synchronization","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","endPage":"1397","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425863.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425863","startPage":"1392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425863","abstract":"This paper focuses on the problem of achieving optimal transmit beamforming for a collection of wireless sensors. The objective is to design distributed algorithms running on each sensor (each carrying an antenna) such that the signals from all sensors combine constructively at the receiver end and thus, the received power is increased. Towards this goal, we propose two algorithms that are applicable to two types of sensor setups: Taking Turn Distributed Beamforming (TT-DB) for sensors with partial global knowledge and Random Grouping Distributed Beamforming (RG-DB) for sensors with no global knowledge. Both algorithms are iterative whereby each sensor adjusts its phase offset without directly communicating with each other. In each iteration, either one sensor or a subset of sensors are selected and then transmit the signals that are carefully crafted based on the SNR feedback from the receiver end. We have proved that guided by either algorithm, the signals from all sensor nodes converge to perfect phase coherence asymptotically, and our simulation results have shown that the convergence steps of both algorithms are linear with respect to the number of sensor nodes in the group.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13288508","htmlLink":"/document/6425863/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed transmit beamforming via feedback-based inter-cluster synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed transmit beamforming via feedback-based inter-cluster synchronization","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059078S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6425868,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Shisheh Foroush","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Shisheh Foroush","id":"38546811500"},{"name":"Sonia Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Mart\u00ednez","id":"37286248800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425868","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425868","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Asymptotic stability","Equations","Lyapunov methods","Computer crime","Pulse width modulation","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","continuous systems","jamming","linear systems","radiocommunication","telecommunication security","telecontrol","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-triggered control","linear system","periodic denial-of-service jamming attack","continuous LTI system resilience","remote control","wireless channel","energy-constrained periodic jammer","partially known jammer","control communication channel corruption","DoS attack","triggering time-sequence","control signal update","sufficient condition","asymptotic stability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the resilience of a continuous LTI system which is controlled remotely via a wireless channel.

It is found that the mixing time of MCMC for integer LS problems depends on the structure of the underlying lattice. More specifically, the mixing time of MCMC is closely related to whether there is a local minimum in the lattice structure. For some lattices, the mixing time of the Markov chain is independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and grows polynomially in the problem dimension; while for some lattices, the mixing time grows unboundedly as SNR grows. Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that to ensure fast mixing, the temperature for MCMC should often grow positively as the SNR increases. We also derive the probability that there exist local minima in an integer least-square problem, which can be as high as equation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425890","startPage":"2545","endPage":"2550","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425890.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the mixing time of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for integer least-square problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the mixing time of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for integer least-square problems","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425890/","accessionNumber":"13288535","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425890/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the mixing time of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for integer least-square problems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067679S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6425904,"authors":[{"name":"Ermin Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ermin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37845176900"},{"name":"Asuman Ozdaglar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Ozdaglar","id":"37300992700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425904","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":160,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards","Lagrangian functions","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix multiplication","multi-agent systems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed alternating direction method","global unconstrained optimization problem","privately known local objective functions","distributed optimization methods","subgradient based methods","distributed optimization algorithm","alternating direction method of multipliers","ADMM","sequentially decomposing optimization problems"]}],"abstract":"We consider a network of agents that are cooperatively solving a global unconstrained optimization problem, where the objective function is the sum of privately known local objective functions of the agents.

This offers a simple linear matrix inequality condition that, when satisfied with the chosen PI or PID controller gains, ensures the tracking of constant references, allows the designer to establish a performance index and allows using powerful analysis and design tools for the controller. The validation of the approach is performed experimentally on a Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy micrometric positioning system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425926/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425926/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288567","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"PID control of linear systems with an input hysteresis described by Prandtl-Ishlinskii models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PID control of linear systems with an input hysteresis described by Prandtl-Ishlinskii models","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106714S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6425928,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghao Gui","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, KOREA"],"firstName":"Yonghao","lastName":"Gui","id":"38242464800"},{"name":"Young Ok Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, KOREA"],"firstName":"Young Ok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37836347900"},{"name":"Youngseong Han","affiliation":["Industrial Systems R&D Center, Hyosung Co, Gyeonggi-Do, KOREA"],"firstName":"Youngseong","lastName":"Han","id":"37859238600"},{"name":"Wonhee Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, KOREA"],"firstName":"Wonhee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37536466000"},{"name":"Chung Choo Chung","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chung Choo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37290541900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425928","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Damping","Mathematical model","Oscillators","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Adaptive control","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","damping","feedback","feedforward","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","static VAr compensators","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passivity-based control","nonlinear damping","STATCOM system","nonlinear controller","static synchronous compensator","PBC","Euler Lagrange","feedforward controller","feedback","nonlinear dynamics equation","equilibrium point","inductive operating mode","transient response oscillation","time response","global exponential stability","Lyapunov theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6425928","abstract":"This paper describes a nonlinear controller for a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). A passivity-based controller (PBC) using the Euler-Lagrange form is proposed for this system. The proposed PBC consists of a feedforward part and a feedback part. The feedforward part is generated from the dynamics equation of the STATCOM system. The feedback part is designed based on the Lyapunov function, thus guaranteeing the exponential stability of the equilibrium point. In inductive operating mode, the system with the PBC experiences undesirable transient response oscillations. To achieve improved performance in terms of the time-response, a PBC with nonlinear damping is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed control method has the effect of reducing the oscillatory responses. Furthermore, the global exponential stability of the system is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov theorem.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6425928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6425928","startPage":"1715","endPage":"1720","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06425928.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity-based control with nonlinear damping for STATCOM system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Passivity-based control with nonlinear damping for STATCOM system","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6425928/","accessionNumber":"13288569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6425928/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity-based control with nonlinear damping for STATCOM system","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066881S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6425928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6425935,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37577757400"},{"name":"Naira Hovakimyan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Naira","lastName":"Hovakimyan","id":"37299175600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6425935","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Adaptive systems","Standards","Simulation","MIMO","Frequency measurement","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","piecewise constant techniques","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","modified piecewise constant adaptation law","multi-input multi-output systems","matched nonlinear uncertainties","unmatched nonlinear uncertainties","standard L1 adaptive law","measurement frequency","performance level"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n adaptive controller for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with both matched and unmatched nonlinear uncertainties.

As the attitude of the UAV directly determines solar intensity normal to the vertical surface of the wing, we use a unit quaternion based method to control the attitude maneuver during the flight interval.

In order to analyze this hybrid system from both stability and performance perspectives, we employ the so-called input delay approach to map the closed-loop system into the continuous-time domain. This would help in the design of a sampled-data controller in a direct way without actually discretizing the continuous-time system. Due to the state-delay representation of the transformed closed-loop system imposed by the sampled-data controller, we further develop a delay-dependent approach for control synthesis purposes.

The usage of wireless communication introduces time-varying sampling intervals, delays, and communication constraints of which the impact on string stability requires a careful analysis. In particular, we study a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system which regulates inter-vehicle distances in a vehicle string and utilizes information exchange between vehicles through wireless communication in addition to local sensor measurements. The propagation of disturbances through the interconnected vehicle string is inspected by using the notion of so-called string stability which is formulated here in terms of an \u2112\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n-gain requirement from disturbance inputs to controlled outputs. This paper provides conditions on the uncertain sampling intervals and delays under which string stability can still be guaranteed. These results support the design of CACC systems that are robust to uncertainties introduced by wireless communication.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426042.pdf","startPage":"2459","endPage":"2464","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"String stability of interconnected vehicles under communication constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Portable document format","IEEE Xplore"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426042/","xploreNote":"PDF Not Yet Available In IEEE Xplore.

To guarantee a high system throughput in CRNs, the channel state of PUs needs to be accurately detected to reduce conflict. To this end, cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed to improve sensing accuracy by exploiting the spatial diversity of secondary users (SUs). However, existing works either focus on a single-channel setting, or make certain restrictive assumptions for multi-channel scenarios. In particular, most works on multi-channel CRNs place no limit on the number of channels that an SU can sense, which is impractical due to hardware and sensing duration constraints. In this paper, we study the throughput maximization problem for a multi-channel CRN where each SU can only sense a limited number of channels. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard, and propose an approximation algorithm with a factor of equation, where l\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>\n is the number of channels that SU i can sense and N is the total number of SUs. This performance guarantee is achieved by exploiting a nice structural property, the subadditivity, of the objective function. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm compared with both a random and a greedy sensing assignment algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreNote":"PDF Not Yet Available In IEEE Xplore.

Network entities-nodes or functional layers-exchange Lagrange multipliers and primal minimizers of the Lagrangian function towards optimizing a network-wide performance metric. It is of interest to study the performance of the resultant algorithms when such exchanges are delayed or lost. This paper deals with such asynchronous dual subgradient methods in separable convex programming. In this scenario, the subgradient vector is a sum of components, each possibly corresponding to an outdated Lagrange multiplier, and not the current one. A number of network entities is allowed to prematurely stop updating their corresponding variables, thereby effecting infinite delay between the current iterate and the multipliers used for a number of subgradient components. Conditions for convergence of the algorithm are developed. Specific applications include multipath routing in wireline networks and cross-layer optimization in wireless networks. Numerical tests for multipath routing in the Abilene network topology are presented.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426107","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Meanwhile, in order to compensate for the NN residual reconstruction error and system uncertainties, a robust term is introduced and asymptotic tracking stability is achieved. All the signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be bounded via Lyapunov synthesis and the output converges to the desired trajectory asymptotically without transgressing a given bound.

The integral functional allow the mixing of the original state constraints with the errors in a form amenable to stable backstepping control design. This reduces some of the conservatism associated with the use of purely error-based functions with transformed error constraints. We show that, under the proposed iBLF-based control, output tracking error is bounded by an exponentially decreasing function of time, all states always remain in the constrained state space, and that the stabilizing functions and control input are bounded, subject to significantly relaxed feasibility conditions. A numerical example illustrates the performance of the proposed control.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426196.pdf","startPage":"3239","endPage":"3244","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of state-constrained nonlinear systems using Integral Barrier Lyapunov Functionals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Nonlinear systems","Lyapunov methods","Trajectory","Control design","Backstepping","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-constrained nonlinear system control","integral barrier Lyapunov functional","backstepping control design","purely error-based function","error constraint","iBLF-based control","output tracking error","time function","stabilizing function","feasibility condition","control input"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Control of state-constrained nonlinear systems using Integral Barrier Lyapunov Functionals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426196/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288824","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of state-constrained nonlinear systems using Integral Barrier Lyapunov Functionals","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051455S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6426206,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Omran","affiliation":["LAGIS (CNRS UMR 8219), \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Omran","id":"38547109800"},{"name":"Laurentiu Hetel","affiliation":["LAGIS (CNRS UMR 8219), \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Laurentiu","lastName":"Hetel","id":"37398910000"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Richard","affiliation":["INRIA, Project NON-A, Lille, France","LAGIS (CNRS UMR 8219), \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Richard","id":"37290268300"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7oise Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue","affiliation":["CNRS, Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, SUPELEC, European Embedded Control Institute, Gif Sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7oise","lastName":"Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue","id":"38547449100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426206","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Nonlinear systems","Lyapunov methods","Numerical stability","Symmetric matrices","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","sampled data systems","sampling methods","stability","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilinear sampled-data system","static state feedback emulation","stability analysis","linear state feedback static controller","zero order hold device","maximum allowable sampling period","MASP","stability condition","linear matrix inequalities","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilinear systems","sampled-data","emulation","stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426206","abstract":"This note is dedicated to the stability analysis of bilinear sampled-data systems, controlled via a linear state feedback static controller.

Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that involve polynomial and rational functions are typically used to model biochemical reaction networks. Such nonlinear models make the problem of determining the connectivity of biochemical networks from time-series experimental data quite difficult. In this paper, we present a network reconstruction algorithm that can deal with ODE model descriptions containing polynomial and rational functions. Rather than identifying the parameters of linear or nonlinear ODEs characterised by pre-defined equation structures, our methodology allows us to determine the nonlinear ODEs structure together with their associated parameters. To solve the network reconstruction problem, we cast it as a compressive sensing (CS) problem and use sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithms as a computationally efficient and robust way to obtain its solution.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426216","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426216.pdf","startPage":"2334","endPage":"2339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of arbitrary biochemical reaction networks: A compressive sensing approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426216/","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of arbitrary biochemical reaction networks: A compressive sensing approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288843","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426216/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of arbitrary biochemical reaction networks: A compressive sensing approach","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10539S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6426217,"authors":[{"name":"Pavankumar Tallapragada","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Pavankumar","lastName":"Tallapragada","id":"38488668500"},{"name":"Nikhil Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and The Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Chopra","id":"37283228300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426217","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1040},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Closed loop systems","Computer architecture","Output feedback","Measurement errors","Asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTI system","event triggered dynamic output feedback controller","event triggering condition","sampled data implementation","inter sample times","asymptotic stability","closed loop system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a systematic methodology for designing implicitly verified event-triggered dynamic output feedback controllers for LTI systems that are observable and controllable.

However, the dc architecture is based on multi-stage power converters where point-of-load converters can be seen by the feeder converter as constant power loads (CPLs). This nonlinear characteristic and the frequent change of the availability of energy sources and loads makes the linear control inadequate. This work addresses the nonlinear stability analysis of a stand-alone dc network. In addition, it is proposed a sliding mode controller based on a washout filter that is responsible for controlling the balance of power (load demand and generation) through a dc-dc bidirectional converter (DBC). This converter is connected to a storage device that plays the role of maintaining a constant dc bus voltage.

Using a Lyapunov approach, we will derive an explicit relation between the bound on maximum allowable sampling period and the parameters of the observer in order to guarantee an asymptotic convergence of the observation error.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Convergence","Gain measurement","Continuous time systems","Approximation methods","Asymptotic stability","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","measurement systems","observers","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamical continuous high gain observer","sampled measurements system","nonlinear Lipschitz sampled-data system","dynamic observation gain","Lyapunov approach","asymptotic convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426327","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426327.pdf","startPage":"6635","endPage":"6640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical continuous high gain observer for sampled measurements systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical continuous high gain observer for sampled measurements systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426327/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426327/","accessionNumber":"13288950","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical continuous high gain observer for sampled measurements systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0656S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6426347,"authors":[{"name":"Valentin Tanasa","affiliation":["University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania","Laboratoire des Signaux et Systemes, CNRS-SUPELEC Paris, Gif Sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Tanasa","id":"38264214000"},{"name":"Salvatore Monaco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica 'Antonio Ruberti', Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Roma, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Monaco","id":"37299743100"},{"name":"Doroth\u00e9e Normand-Cyrot","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Systemes, CNRS-SUPELEC Paris, Gif Sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Doroth\u00e9e","lastName":"Normand-Cyrot","id":"38548571100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426347","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426347","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Gold","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","control system synthesis","direct digital control","minimisation","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","sampling methods","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear optimal stabilizing control","optimal stabilizing controller design","input-affine continuous-time dynamics","digital controller","direct digital approach","modified cost functional minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear Systems","Digital control","Optimal control"]}],"abstract":"Starting from an optimal stabilizing controller designed for an input-affine continuous-time dynamics, the paper discusses the problem of computing a digital controller which preserves these properties under sampling.

The remote estimator is a time-varying Kalman filter. The triggering decision is based on the estimation variance: the sensor runs a copy of the remote estimator and transmits a measurement if the associated measurement prediction variance exceeds a tolerable threshold. The resulting variance iteration is a new type of Riccati equation with switching that corresponds to the availability or unavailability of a measurement and depends on the variance at the previous step. We study asymptotic properties of the variance iteration and, in particular, asymptotic convergence to a periodic solution.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426352","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426352.pdf","startPage":"6583","endPage":"6590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-based state estimation with variance-based triggering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426352/","displayDocTitle":"Event-based state estimation with variance-based triggering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13288975","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426352/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-based state estimation with variance-based triggering","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084416S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6426355,"authors":[{"name":"Jerome Le Ny","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Le Ny","id":"37546028800"},{"name":"George J.

This can result in an undesirable loss of privacy for the users in exchange of the benefits provided by the application. Motivated by this trend, we introduce privacy concerns in a system theoretic context, and address here the problem of releasing filtered signals that respect the privacy of the input data stream.We rely on a formal notion of privacy introduced in the database literature, called differential privacy, which provides strong privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information, and extend this notion to dynamic systems. We then describe methods to approximate a given filter by a differentially private version, so that the distortion introduced by the privacy mechanism is minimized. Two specific scenarios are considered, where users either provide independent input signals or contribute events to a single integer-valued stream.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426355.pdf","startPage":"3398","endPage":"3403","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentially private filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Differentially private filtering","htmlLink":"/document/6426355/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13288978","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differentially private filtering","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071053S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6426370,"authors":[{"name":"I.

As we discuss, the use of push-sum has significant advantages. Restricting to doubly stochastic consensus protocols is not required and convergence to the true average consensus is guaranteed without knowing the stationary distribution of the update matrix in advance. Furthermore, the communication semantics of just summing the incoming information make this algorithm truly asynchronous and allow a clean analysis when varying intercommunication intervals and communication delays are modelled. We include experiments in simulation and on a small cluster to complement the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426375","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","startPage":"5453","endPage":"5458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Push-Sum Distributed Dual Averaging for convex optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Push-Sum Distributed Dual Averaging for convex optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreNote":"PDF Not Yet Available In IEEE Xplore.

We derive the path integral optimal control framework and its iterative version based on the aforemetioned dualities. The resulting formulation of iterative path integral control is valid for general feedback policies and in contrast to previous work, it does not rely on pre-specified policy parameterizations. The derivation is based on successive applications of Girsanov's theorem and the use of Radon-Nikod\u00fdm derivative as applied to diffusion processes due to the change of measure in the stochastic dynamics. We compare the PI control derived based on Dynamic Programming with PI based on the duality between free energy and relative entropy. Moreover we extend our analysis on the applicability of the relationship between free energy and relative entropy to optimal control of markov jump diffusions processes. Furthermore, we present the links between KL stochastic optimal control and the aforementioned dualities and discuss its generalizability.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426381","startPage":"1466","endPage":"1473","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426381.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative entropy and free energy dualities: Connections to Path Integral and KL control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Relative entropy and free energy dualities: Connections to Path Integral and KL control","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426381/","accessionNumber":"13289003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426381/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative entropy and free energy dualities: Connections to Path Integral and KL control","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057101S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6426404,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Molin","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Molin","id":"37408145100"},{"name":"Sandra Hirche","affiliation":["Institute of Automatic Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Hirche","id":"37301349100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426404","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Communication networks","Approximation methods","Control systems","Approximation algorithms","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","convergence","discrete time systems","linear systems","Markov processes","networked control systems","optimisation","stochastic systems","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive event-triggered control","multiple heterogeneous control loops","shared communication network","discrete-time stochastic linear system","Markov decision process","global system parameters","distributed optimization","adaptive MDP","distributed self-regulating event-triggers","convergence"]}],"abstract":"Under many circumstances event-triggered control outperforms time-triggered control schemes when resources such as communication, computation, or energy are sparse.

The system under consideration comprises multiple heterogeneous control loops that are closed over a shared communication network. Each subsystem is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic linear system. The design problem is formulated as an average cost Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown global system parameters that are to be estimated during execution.

Agents belonging to the same team communicate over wireless ad hoc networks, and they distribute their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the communication network nodes of the other team. This is a generalization of our earlier work in [7] which considered the special case when each team consists of only two agents. Here we consider the nontrivial extension to multiple agents (in each team). The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function adopted is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the problem as a zero-sum differential game between the two teams (where the teams are the actual players in the zero-sum game) and use Isaacs' approach to obtain necessary conditions for the corresponding trajectories. The solution to the optimal control problem for each team in turn depends on the solution to the power allocation problem for each agent. The power allocation problem is a non-zero sum game between the two teams, and we present sufficient conditions for the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Finally, we provide some simulation results to validate the approach taken.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6426411/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289032","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer hierarchical approach to double sided jamming games among teams of mobile agents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer hierarchical approach to double sided jamming games among teams of mobile agents","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159325S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6426419,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Battistelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica, DSI-Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Battistelli","id":"37275214500"},{"name":"Alessio Benavoli","affiliation":["Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull Intelligenza Artificiale, Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Benavoli","id":"37295922900"},{"name":"Luigi Chisci","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica, DSI-Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Chisci","id":"37265568300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426419","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Observability","Noise","Noise measurement","Wireless sensor networks","Ellipsoids","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear estimation","observability","sensor fusion","state estimation","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective data transmission","energy efficiency","wireless sensor networks","nonlinear state estimation","centralized sensor network","central information fusion unit","smart data-driven strategies","data communication reduction","congestion problem avoidance","network lifetime","periodic transmission","measurement strategies","estimate transmission strategies","nonlinear sensors","nonlinear observability decompositions","bearing-only tracking simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426419","abstract":"Energy efficiency is a crucial issue for any task involving wireless sensor networks.

For such processes the statistical model which is obtained from process data is different from one operating point to another, due to nonlinearities and set-point changes. Therefore the classical methods for quality monitoring and fault detection, e.g. partial least squares (PLS), may not be suitable. To this end, a new approach is proposed based on the modeling of nonlinear process as a piecewise linear parameter varying system, considering the behavior of the plant in each operating point as linear time invariant with different parameters in each operating point. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to model the process as a finite mixture of Gaussian components and based on the identified model a Bayesian inference strategy is developed to detect the faults which influence the product quality. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a laboratory continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH) setup.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Water

Then, a mapping of the state space is designed offline: it computes for each state of the state space a lower-bound estimation of the maximum allowable sampling interval, which makes it possible to reduce the number of actuations during the real-time control of the system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Switches","Tin","Stability analysis","Time varying systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","perturbation techniques","sampling methods","stability","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perturbed time-delay systems","state-dependent sampling control","state-feedback control","perturbed linear time-invariant systems","input-delay","switched Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals","state-dependent matrices","LMI problem","state space","lower-bound estimation","maximum allowable sampling interval","real-time control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426445","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426445.pdf","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-dependent sampling for perturbed time-delay systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"State-dependent sampling for perturbed time-delay systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426445/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426445/","accessionNumber":"13289066","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-dependent sampling for perturbed time-delay systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068108S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6426458,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Patrinos","affiliation":["IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Patrinos","id":"38233038100"},{"name":"Alberto Bemporad","affiliation":["IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Bemporad","id":"37300848100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426458","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"abstract":"This paper proposes a dual fast gradient-projection method for solving quadratic programming problems that arise in linear model predictive control with general polyhedral constraints on inputs and states.

Using this scheme, the next sampling period is dynamically obtained with respect to (a) the desired performance; (b) the latest accepted time-stamped control packet; and (c) the allowable communication delay and the maximum allowable number of successive data dropouts. This scheme can adaptively adjust the sampling period to reduce communication loads with maintaining the desired control performance. Compared with some existing ones, this scheme does not require continuous measurement of the system state and on-line estimation of a triggering condition. An inverted pendulum is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426577","startPage":"3904","endPage":"3909","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426577.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel self-triggered sampling scheme in networked control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel self-triggered sampling scheme in networked control systems","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426577/","accessionNumber":"13289196","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426577/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel self-triggered sampling scheme in networked control systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08142S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6426584,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangming Xi","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangming","lastName":"Xi","id":"38547008100"},{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Faculty of Research Institute of Automation, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404871800"},{"name":"Xiaomu Mu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomu","lastName":"Mu","id":"38247119500"},{"name":"Shuning Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuning","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280449400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426584","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Programming","Linear programming","Biological cells","Fasteners","Genetics","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","genetic algorithms","linear programming","minimisation","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous piecewise linear programming","concave optimization","genetic algorithm","hinging hyperplane","system identification","CPWL programming problem","hinge function","piecewise linearity","concavity","minimization","cutting plane method","local minima locating method","global optimality","genetic operations"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) programming where the objective and constraints are in the form of hinging hyperplane (HH). And HH has received wide attention due to its simplicity and good performance in system identification. When solving a CPWL programming problem, some excellent features inspire us to come up with more efficient algorithms: the two distinguished states of a hinge function reminds us of application of genetic algorithm, while the piecewise linearity and concavity of the problem of minimization of HH naturally lead to the usage of well developed methods for concave programming, such as the cutting plane method. In order to find the global minima, we propose an improved genetic algorithm (GA) incorporating the cutting plane method. The main improvement lies in three aspects. First, it utilizes binary strings that derive local minima as chromosomes, with the proposed local minima locating method. Second, a stopping criterion has been established to ensure the global optimality of GA, with the structure information provided by \u03b3 extension of local minima. And third, genetic operations have also been revised to enhance the performance of the algorithm, which is assessed by the computational experiments.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426584","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426584.pdf","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous piecewise linear programming via concave optimization and genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426584/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous piecewise linear programming via concave optimization and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289203","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426584/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous piecewise linear programming via concave optimization and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"1063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075499S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6426626,"authors":[{"name":"Alekh Agarwal","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alekh","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"38236821700"},{"name":"John C.

The main application of our results is to gradient-based distributed optimization algorithms where a master node performs parameter updates while worker nodes compute stochastic gradients based on local information in parallel, which may give rise to delays due to asynchrony. We take motivation from statistical problems where the size of the data is so large that it cannot fit on one computer; with the advent of huge datasets in biology, astronomy, and the internet, such problems are now common. Our main contribution is to show that for smooth stochastic problems, the delays are asymptotically negligible and we can achieve order-optimal convergence results. We show n-node architectures whose optimization error in stochastic problems-in spite of asynchronous delays-scales asymptotically as O(1/\u221anT) after T iterations. This rate is known to be optimal for a distributed system with n nodes even in the absence of delays. We additionally complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments on a logistic regression task.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426626","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426626.pdf","startPage":"5451","endPage":"5452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed delayed stochastic optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426626/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed delayed stochastic optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289244","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426626/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed delayed stochastic optimization","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034921S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6426640,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Pilloni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Pilloni","id":"38234063700"},{"name":"Alessandro Pisano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Pisano","id":"37284690500"},{"name":"Elio Usai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DIEE), University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Elio","lastName":"Usai","id":"37284691500"},{"name":"Rub\u00e9n Puche-Panadero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Rub\u00e9n","lastName":"Puche-Panadero","id":"38547264000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426640","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of rotor broken bar and eccentricity faults in induction motors via second order sliding mode observer","abstract":"This paper provides a novel approach for detecting certain abnormal operating conditions in squirrel cage induction motors (SCIMs). A mathematical model of the faulty operating mode is derived with the rotor broken bars and the rotor eccentricity being the faults of interest. To detect the fault occurrence, an appropriate FDI observer, based on second order sliding modes, is presented and analyzed by Lyapunov methods. The ability of the suggested FDI observer to produce suitable residual signals which allow a reliable threshold-based fault detection is shown. Once the fault is detected, dedicated FFT analysis of the residuals allows the classification of the fault. The proposed scheme has been verified by real implementation tests using measurements taken from certain commercial three-phase SCIMs intentionally damaged in order to reproduce the fault scenarios of concern. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the suggested framework.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Observers","Induction motors","Mathematical model","Stators","Bars","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","fault diagnosis","Lyapunov matrix equations","machine control","observers","reliability","rotors","squirrel cage motors","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotor broken bar","eccentricity faults","second order sliding mode observer","squirrel cage induction motors","SCIM","faulty operating mode","fault detection and isolation","FDI observer","Lyapunov methods","FFT analysis","fault classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426640","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426640","startPage":"7614","endPage":"7619","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426640.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426640/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of rotor broken bar and eccentricity faults in induction motors via second order sliding mode observer","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13289258","htmlLink":"/document/6426640/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of rotor broken bar and eccentricity faults in induction motors via second order sliding mode observer","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122055S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6426665,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro D.

We propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm for DER optimal dispatch that relies, at each iteration, on simple computations using local information acquired through exchange of information with neighboring DERs.

For this, we rely on collaborative beamforming, where groups of nodes collaborate to adjust the initial phase of their transmitted signals to form a beam that focuses on the direction of a desired destination. This allows for transmission over large distances, minimizes multiuser interference and also provides significant power savings, which increases network longevity. Beamforming has been thoroughly studied in the networking literature in the context of stationary antennas. The contribution of this work is a novel framework that jointly optimizes the beamforming weights and node positions in networks of mobile beamformers. In particular, a hybrid control scheme is proposed, in which optimal beamforming is integrated with potential-field-based motion control, designed to optimize power consumption in the space of node positions, while ensuring QoS. The integrated system is shown to exhibit superior performance in terms of power savings compared to approaches that do not consider node mobility. This makes our approach very promising for further research and applications in mobile wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426683/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13289299","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426683/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Controlling groups of mobile beamformers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling groups of mobile beamformers","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135094S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6426691,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38548021600"},{"name":"John C.

Recent work has developed a non-raster scheme for string-like samples such as biopolymers that reduces imaging time by reducing the total number of measurements. This local raster-scan algorithm steers the tip in a sinusoidal path along the sample, acquiring only data near the sample of interest. It has been shown that for a particular class of samples, an order-of-magnitude reduction in imaging time is possible. In this paper we build upon that approach but consider time-lapse imaging. In this scenario, the prior knowledge from previous images can be used to setup a time-optimal control problem between successive crossing points along the string-like sample. Using recent results in time-optimal control, we solve this problem and illustrate that it can, in principle at least, yield at least an additional order of magnitude improvement in the imaging rate.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6426849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6426849","startPage":"5073","endPage":"5078","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06426849.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast scanning in AFM using non-raster sampling and time-optimal trajectories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast scanning in AFM using non-raster sampling and time-optimal trajectories","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426849/","accessionNumber":"13289462","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426849/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast scanning in AFM using non-raster sampling and time-optimal trajectories","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065393S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6426855,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Domahidi","affiliation":["Automatic Control Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Domahidi","id":"37391593100"},{"name":"Aldo U.

We present efficient interior point methods tailored to convex multistage problems, a problem class which most relevant MPC problems with linear dynamics can be cast in, and specify important algorithmic details required for a high speed implementation with superior numerical stability. In particular, the presented approach allows for quadratic constraints, which is not supported by existing fast MPC solvers. A categorization of widely used MPC problem formulations into classes of different complexity is given, and we show how the computational burden of certain quadratic or linear constraints can be decreased by a low rank matrix forward substitution scheme. Implementation details are provided that are crucial to obtain high speed solvers.We present extensive numerical studies for the proposed methods and compare our solver to three well-known solver packages, outperforming the fastest of these by a factor 2-5 in speed and 3-70 in code size. Moreover, our solver is shown to be very efficient for large problem sizes and for quadratically constrained QPs, extending the set of systems amenable to advanced MPC formulations on low-cost embedded hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426855/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13289468","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6426855/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient interior point methods for multistage problems arising in receding horizon control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient interior point methods for multistage problems arising in receding horizon control","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069384S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":6426885,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Cui","affiliation":["ECE Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Cui","id":"37398552900"},{"name":"Vincent K.

In a consensus-based state estimation framework, multiple neighboring nodes iteratively communicate with each other, exchanging their own local estimates of a target's state with the goal of converging to a single state estimate over the entire network. However, the state estimation problem becomes challenging when a node has limited observability of the state. In addition, the consensus estimate is sub-optimal when the cross-covariances between the individual state estimates across different nodes are not incorporated in the distributed estimation framework. The cross-covariance is usually neglected because the computational and bandwidth requirements for its computation grow exponentially with the number of nodes. These limitations can be overcome by noting that, as the state estimates at different nodes converge, the information at each node becomes redundant. This fact can be utilized to compute the optimal estimate by proper weighting of the prior state and measurement information. Motivated by this idea, we propose information-weighted consensus algorithms for distributed maximum a posteriori parameter estimates, and their extension to the information-weighted consensus filter (ICF) for state estimation. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed methods asymptotically approach the optimal centralized performance. Simulation results show that ICF is robust even when the optimality conditions are not met and has low communication requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6426886/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289499","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Information weighted consensus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information weighted consensus","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048967S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6426886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6426909,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Li","affiliation":["Adaptive Networks and Control Laboratory, the Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085872442"},{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Adaptive Networks and Control Laboratory, the Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37280876300"},{"name":"Yu-Ying Jin","affiliation":["School of International Business Administration, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Ying","lastName":"Jin","id":"38548564500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6426909","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426909","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Diseases","Laboratories","Inference algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","epidemics","hospitals","microorganisms","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven inference algorithm","epidemic pathways","surveillance reports","2009 outbreak","influenza A (H1N1)","epidemiological infective-hospitalized model","IH model","heuristic algorithm","infective individual transition","metapopulation level","United States","invasion tree","virus"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an epidemiological infective-hospitalized (IH) model and adopt a heuristic algorithm to predict the transition of infective individuals, which optimizes, at the metapopulation level, the IH model's approximation to the surveillance reports of (cumulative) laboratory confirmed cases.

Information System evolution has been supported by the reengineering process. Since the models are now part of an increasing number of engineering processes and model-driven software development is a well-established paradigm to support information systems, the reengineering process could be improved with the incorporation of the model-driven development paradigm. This paper presents a model-driven organisational reengineering framework to support organisational improvement. The main idea is to get the most out of the existing proposals in model-driven development for the reengineering process (reverse engineering, improvement processes, and forward processes). Methods, techniques, model-driven tools, and perspectives for analysing information systems at a high level of abstraction are presented as a part of this proposal. A reference framework for the reengineering process is established to provide a consistent set of concepts that support the proposed framework. An illustrative example is introduced to present the feasibility of the proposal. The example illustrates the SuperStationery Co. case in order to present a reengineering process to align an existing desk application with a web application that fulfils the strategic goals of the company. Finally, we conclude with an analysis and discussion about lessons learned and future works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6426916/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286821","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven organisational reengineering A framework to support organisational improvement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven organisational reengineering A framework to support organisational improvement","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"cleiis28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077474S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6418229","isNumber":"6426913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6418229","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6426913","articleId":"6426916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6426919,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano Maron","affiliation":["PPGC-CDTec, UFPEL, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Maron","id":"37598607800"},{"name":"Renata Reiser","affiliation":["PPGC-CDTec, UFPEL, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Renata","lastName":"Reiser","id":"37598624200"},{"name":"Maur\u00edcio Pilla","affiliation":["PPGC-CDTec, UFPEL, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Maur\u00edcio","lastName":"Pilla","id":"38527331000"},{"name":"Adenauer Yamin","affiliation":["PPGC-CDTec, UFPEL, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Adenauer","lastName":"Yamin","id":"37267159600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0792-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6426919","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Quantum computing","Quantum mechanics","Tensile stress","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum transformation","VPE-qGM environment","classic computer","storing capability","quantum system","temporal complexity","spatial complexity","partial quantum process","complex quantum algorithm","quantum computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum computing","simulation of quantum algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The simulation of quantum algorithms in classic computers is a task which requires high processing and storing capabilities, limiting the size of quantum systems supported by the simulators. However, optimizations for reduction of temporal and spatial complexities are promising, expanding the capabilities of some simulators. The main contribution of this work consists in designing optimizations resulting from the description of quantum transformations using Quantum Processes and Partial Quantum Processes conceived in the qGM theoretical model. These processes, when computed on the VPE-qGM execution environment, require low execution time and result in the improvement of the performance, allowing the simulation of more complex quantum algorithms. The performance evaluation of this proposal was performed by benchmarks used in similar works and included the sequential simulation of quantum algorithms up to 24 qubits. The results are promising when compared to the state-of-art, indicating the possibilities of advances in this research.","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2012.6426919","publicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6418229/6426913/06426919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2012.6426919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426913","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum processes: A new interpretation for quantum transformations in the VPE-qGM environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6426919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantum processes: A new interpretation for quantum transformations in the VPE-qGM environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6426919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286824","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6426919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum processes: A new interpretation for quantum transformations in the VPE-qGM environment","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"cleitc4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082575S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6418229","isNumber":"6426913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6418229","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6426913","articleId":"6426919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6427007,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Caharija","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Caharija","id":"37595663800"},{"name":"Kristin Y.

The ocean current is considered constant, irrotational and acting in any direction of the inertial frame. The control technique is based on a modified three-dimensional Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance law with two integrators and three feedback controllers. The integral effect is introduced to successfully counteract the drifting caused by the unknown current. The integration laws are chosen to reduce the risk of wind-up effects. Furthermore, due to the irrotational nature of the ocean current, it is seen that the vehicle dynamics can be defined in terms of relative velocities only. This significantly simplifies the control system compared to approaches based on absolute velocities, and as a result no adaption laws are required. Uniform global asymptotic stability and uniform local exponential stability for the closed loop system are proven and explicit bounds on the guidance law parameters are given.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6427007","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6427007","startPage":"528","endPage":"535","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06427007.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427007/","displayDocTitle":"Path following of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of ocean currents","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13289564","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6427007/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path following of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of ocean currents","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070468S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6427007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6427036,"authors":[{"name":"Shenpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"firstName":"Shenpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37405413300"},{"name":"Jingxin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"firstName":"Jingxin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293675600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6427036","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"This paper is concerned with finding the right inverse for the discrete time systems with flat rectangular transfer function matrix and individual channel power constraints.

In addition, we apply the proposed method to a repetitive control system.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6427066","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06427066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6427066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","startPage":"1584","endPage":"1590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tangential Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for strong stabilization of MIMO distributed parameter systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tangential Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for strong stabilization of MIMO distributed parameter systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427066/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13307678","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6427066/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tangential Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for strong stabilization of MIMO distributed parameter systems","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097858S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6427066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6427081,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Guo","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Guo","id":"38548596700"},{"name":"Jinkun Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinkun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405231900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2065-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2063-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2064-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0743-1546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0743-1546"}],"articleNumber":"6427081","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Aircraft","Backstepping","Adaptive systems","Atmospheric modeling","Approximation methods","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aircraft control","control nonlinearities","low-pass filters","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks","stability","tracking","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based adaptive dynamic surface control method","aircraft longitudinal flight path angle","explosion-of-complexity problem elimination","backstepping approach","low pass filters","radial basis function neural networks","RBF neural networks","unknown nonlinearities","adaptive laws","weight value estimation","unknown parameters","Lyapunov stability analysis","semiglobal practical tracking","arbitrarily small tracking error","nonlinear control","advanced flight vehicles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427081","abstract":"A neural network based adaptive dynamic surface control is proposed for the aircraft longitudinal flight path angle.

With the employment of renewable energy, it will be desirable if OPF can be solved very efficiently so that its solution can be used in real time. With some special network structure, e.g. trees, the problem has been shown to have a zero duality gap and the convex dual problem yields the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a primal and a dual algorithm to coordinate the smaller subproblems decomposed from the convexified OPF. We can arrange the subproblems to be solved sequentially and cumulatively in a central node or solved in parallel in distributed nodes. We test the algorithms on IEEE radial distribution test feeders, some random tree-structured networks, and the IEEE transmission system benchmarks. Simulation results show that the computation time can be improved dramatically with our algorithms over the centralized approach of solving the problem without decomposition, especially in tree-structured problems. The computation time grows linearly with the problem size with the cumulative approach while the distributed one can have size-independent computation time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416474/6425800/06427082.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2012.6427082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2012.6427082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425800","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed algorithms for optimal power flow problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Algorithm design and analysis","Cost function","Optimized production technology","Linear programming","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","distribution networks","electric power generation","IEEE standards","load flow","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","optimal power flow problem","OPF","power generation","renewable energy","convex dual problem","optimal solution","distributed nodes","tree-structured networks","IEEE transmission system benchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed algorithms for optimal power flow problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289624","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed algorithms for optimal power flow problem","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095946S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416474","isNumber":"6425800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416474","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6425800","articleId":"6427082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6427085,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Z.

In the literature there are several different techniques to reduce the energy consumption of the sensors. Sensor node clustering is one of these techniques commonly used. However, finding an optimal clustering in WSNs is a NP-Hard problem, thus heuristics and metaheuristics are the appropriate methods to find good clustering in reasonable computational time. In this work we propose the application of a simple and efficient metaheuristic based on genetic algorithms to obtain near-optimal clustering. We develop a clustering protocol to simulate the clusters formation and data transmission. The good performance of our protocol is compared with the well-known and commonly used clustering protocols for WSNs: LEACH and LEACH-C. The obtained results reveal that the genetic algorithm determines better clusters extending the network lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427155","pdfPath":"/iel5/6418229/6426913/06427155.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","publicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based approach for cluster formation in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based approach for cluster formation in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13286867","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based approach for cluster formation in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"cleiio25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056353S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","isNumber":"6426913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6418229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6427155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6427171,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Avalos Godoy","affiliation":["Facultad Polit\u00e9cnica, Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n, Asuncion, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Avalos Godoy","id":"38548409100"},{"name":"Arturo Ferreira Duarte","affiliation":["Facultad Polit\u00e9cnica, Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n, Asuncion, Paraguay"],"lastName":"Arturo Ferreira Duarte","id":"38548083200"},{"name":"Christian Von L\u00fccken","affiliation":["Facultad Polit\u00e9cnica, Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n, Asuncion, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Von L\u00fccken","id":"38548559700"},{"name":"Enrique D\u00e1valos","affiliation":["Facultad Polit\u00e9cnica, Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n, Asuncion, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"D\u00e1valos","id":"37973470100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0792-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427171","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427171","abstract":"This work presents a new mining model to train Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN) for short term prediction.

However, as the complexity of code generators grow, they tend to be harder to maintain, especially when there is a large amount of templates involved. This paper proposes an approach for code generation based on regular expression substitution. Instead of using templates for code generation, this approach transforms existing source code, using regular expression substitution, to implement the required functionality. We are currently applying this technique to strengthen the code generation framework of Heinsohn Business Technology, as part of the \u201cLion\u201d project co-financed by Colciencias. Our experience shows that, although this approach has a steeper learning curve, it facilitates capitalization of the experience of software development organizations, selecting successfully modules that are taken as a reference source for code generation in future projects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6418229/6426913/06427199.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving implementation of code generators: A regular-expression approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Software","Security","Java","Skeleton","Computer aided software engineering","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program compilers","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code generator implementation","regular expression approach","software development","facilitate portability","abstract implementation details","reduce development costs","automate repetitive coding tasks","source code","regular expression substitution","Heinsohn business technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code Generation","Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE)","Frameworks","Web Applications Development"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving implementation of code generators: A regular-expression approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427199/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286911","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving implementation of code generators: A regular-expression approach","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"cleiis8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073592S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6418229","isNumber":"6426913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6418229","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6426913","articleId":"6427199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6427222,"authors":[{"name":"Guilherme O.

This work proposes an intrusion detection tool based on the two-dimensional wavelet transform to quickly and effectively detect anomalies in computer networks generated by denial of service (DoS). Experiments were performed using two databases: a synthetic (DARPA) and another one from data collected at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), allowing analysis of the intrusion detection tool under different scenarios. The wavelets considered for the tests were all from the orthonormal family of Daubechies: Haar (Db1), Db2, Db4 and Db8 (with 1, 2, 4 and 8 null vanishing moments respectively). For the DARPA database we obtained a detection rate up to 100% and 95% for the UFSM database.","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427250","publicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6418229/6426913/06427250.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DoS attack detection using a two dimensional wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427250/","displayDocTitle":"DoS attack detection using a two dimensional wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286961","conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DoS attack detection using a two dimensional wavelet transform","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"cleiti16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068251S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2012","isNumber":"6426913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6418229","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6427250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6427251,"authors":[{"name":"Yosandra Sandoval","affiliation":["High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Yosandra","lastName":"Sandoval","id":"38548028700"},{"name":"Georgina Gallizo","affiliation":["High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Georgina","lastName":"Gallizo","id":"37589382400"},{"name":"Mariela Curiel","affiliation":["Departamento de Computaci\u00f3n y TI, Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Caracas, Venezuela"],"firstName":"Mariela","lastName":"Curiel","id":"37444417000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0792-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427251","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Monitoring","Computational modeling","Hardware","Cloud computing","Lattices","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monitoring tool","cloud computing environment","distributed computing","computational resource-as-a-service","grid computing","virtualization","Web 2.0","OPTIMIS project","BonFIRE project"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","monitoring","cloud environments","monitoring tools"]}],"abstract":"Among the advances that the world of distributed computing has had, one must take into account the emergence of new paradigms such as Cloud Computing. The Cloud Computing Model integrates and offers to users several computational resources as a service, on demand. The Cloud model is supported by technologies such as Grid Computing, virtualization and Web 2.0. The monitoring is a very complex issue in this model, due to the particular characteristics of supporting platform. Furthermore, research in this topic has been rather poor. Our research work focuses on Monitoring in Cloud Computing platforms, particularly in private and hybrid.

However, the control they provide is limited, leaving potential for serious errors. The current mobile robot systems concentrate on position accuracy and operational function but leave open management of safety hazards such as entering the dangerous and not intended areas as stairway. In order to increase the safety of the robot, it is as important to work with sensors installed in the external environment as the sensors installed on the robot. For this purpose, visible light communication (VLC) is a promising device to be used with the robot system. VLC creates an in-house GPS system by installing special LED lights that can replace standard lighting in key locations in the hospital. We have developed an in-hospital transportation robot, called HOSPI in which the control system has been enhanced by combining the navigational sensors of the robot and a VLC using installed lighting in the building. By using VLC, robots can obtain more information about the environment. As the first step for the practical application of VLC to robot system, we use VLC to overcome problems in conventional localization approaches, and to provide an additional line of defense in the case of catastrophic failures. This paper also describes experimental and actual operational results in detail of robots equipped, in an actual hospital, with the described process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Hospitals","Collision avoidance","Floors","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hazards","light emitting diodes","medical robotics","mobile robots","optical communication","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communication system","enhanced control","control systems","autonomous mobile delivery robots","position accuracy","operational function","safety hazards","VLC","LED lights","in-hospital transportation robot","HOSPI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SII.2012.6427311","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416132/6426928/06427311.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SII.2012.6427311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel visible light communication system for enhanced control of autonomous delivery robots in a hospital","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel visible light communication system for enhanced control of autonomous delivery robots in a hospital","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427311/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427311/","accessionNumber":"13286740","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel visible light communication system for enhanced control of autonomous delivery robots in a hospital","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"0157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063234S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416132","isNumber":"6426928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416132","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6426928","articleId":"6427311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6427340,"authors":[{"name":"Van Vuong Nguyen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Van Vuong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38547687400"},{"name":"Joo-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Graduate of Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan"],"firstName":"Joo-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280322500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1497-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1496-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1495-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427340","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":995},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Joints","Humanoid robots","Robot kinematics","Shoulder","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","robot kinematics","robot vision","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-body imitation","human motions","heterogeneous kinematic structure","humanoid body pose","static stability","visual motion","Webots simulation","Darwin-OP humanoid robot","Kinect"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427340","abstract":"In this work, we propose a system that has the ability to reproduce imitated motions of human during continuous and online observation with a humanoid robot.

Especially, the energy efficient path for UAVs under the presence of steady wind is discussed. Although the relation between the energy consumption and the flight path parameters is hard to model explicitly in general, which induces the difficulty to adopt gradient based optimization techniques. On the other hand, actual energy consumption can be measured, e.g. by measuring fuel consumption rate, and it is natural to assume that the rate is a function of flight path. This paper proposes to perturb the flight path in order to estimate the gradient of the energy consumption rate that is used for the optimization, which is based on Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method. Numerical results are shown to evaluate the proposed approach, and the method succeeded to improve the energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles under steady wind","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","doi":"10.1109/SII.2012.6427369","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416132/6426928/06427369.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SII.2012.6427369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles under steady wind","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427369/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles under steady wind","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"0095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073492S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416132","isNumber":"6426928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416132","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6426928","articleId":"6427369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6427479,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeman Park","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeman","lastName":"Park","id":"38548159700"},{"name":"Jongho Lee","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongho","lastName":"Lee","id":"38547553500"},{"name":"Eun Namgung","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eun","lastName":"Namgung","id":"38547670400"},{"name":"Seungsoo Lee","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungsoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"38548543300"},{"name":"Seikwon Kim","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seikwon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38547723700"},{"name":"Keunseob Kim","affiliation":["Software R/D center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Keunseob","lastName":"Kim","id":"38362549100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427479","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Silicon","Conferences","Computational modeling","Browsers","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cloud computing","content management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content cache management scheme","offline environment","cloud system","cloud computing environment","media contents","cloud server storage","client device","content properties","eviction algorithm","user preference data","content usage history"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","cache management","Hit-Ratio","offline support"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cache management scheme to support offline environment in cloud system","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427479","startPage":"387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427479","abstract":"In cloud computing environment, cloud clients may view media contents, such as document, music, and/or video, stored in the cloud server storage.

Olariu et al. envisioned the next paradigm shift from conventional VANET to Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) by merging VANET with cloud computing. But to date, in the literature, there is no solid architecture for cloud computing from VANET standpoint. In this paper, we put forth the taxonomy of VANET based cloud computing. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first effort to define VANET Cloud architecture. Additionally we divide VANET clouds into three architectural frameworks named Vehicular Clouds (VC), Vehicles using Clouds (VuC), and Hybrid Vehicular Clouds (HVC).

Meanwhile, the same embedded devices continue to improve in terms of computational capabilities, thus closing the gap with more traditional computers. Motivated by these trends, we developed a heterogeneous computing system for MapReduce applications that couples cloud computing with distributed embedded computing. Specifically, our system combines a central cluster of Linux servers with a broadband network of embedded set-top box (STB) devices. The MapReduce platform is based on the Hadoop software framework, which we modified and optimized for execution on the STBs. Experimental results confirm that this type of heterogeneous computing system can offer a scalable and energy-efficient platform for the processing of large-scale data-intensive applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6427483/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286476","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A broadband embedded computing system for MapReduce utilizing Hadoop","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broadband embedded computing system for MapReduce utilizing Hadoop","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059815S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6427489,"authors":[{"name":"Sivadon Chaisiri","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sivadon","lastName":"Chaisiri","id":"37303893500"},{"name":"Zoebir Bong","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zoebir","lastName":"Bong","id":"38230262900"},{"name":"Chonho Lee","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chonho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37066051200"},{"name":"Bu-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bu-Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281110400"},{"name":"Punyapat Sessomboon","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Punyapat","lastName":"Sessomboon","id":"38547269800"},{"name":"Tanakrit Saisillapee","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tanakrit","lastName":"Saisillapee","id":"38548084800"},{"name":"Tiranee Achalakul","affiliation":["King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tiranee","lastName":"Achalakul","id":"37297117200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427489","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":431},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data analysis","resource allocation","software reusability","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workflow framework","data analytics","cloud computing","cloud oriented data analytics framework","CODA framework","workflow composition","workflow management","workflow processing","software component reusability","workflow composers","RapidMiner","Taverna","JOpera","workflow scheduling","workflow recommendation","resource provisioning","resource monitoring","data locality","data security","workflow computation"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports on the development of the Cloud Oriented Data Analytics (CODA) framework which has functions for composing, managing, and processing workflows for data analytics in cloud computing.

In this sense, a Business-Driven IT Management (BDIM) model is aimed to assess the impact of IT-related events on business-level metrics. Thereupon those high-level impacts are consumed by a policy management frame-work able to autonomously determine the most suitable IT-level management actions in terms of provider's BLOs compliance. Furthermore, we show the benefits achieved by a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider when adopting such business-driven management.

In this paper, the first simulation results are demonstrated, proofing the concept.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427522","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427522.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware model of automatically adaptive cloud computing architecture in 2D matrix grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427522/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware model of automatically adaptive cloud computing architecture in 2D matrix grid","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427522/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286515","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware model of automatically adaptive cloud computing architecture in 2D matrix grid","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"2301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046935S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6427529,"authors":[{"name":"Fuu-Cheng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fuu-Cheng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37588645700"},{"name":"Chao-Tung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Tung","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099800"},{"name":"Ching-Hsien Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hsien","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276770900"},{"name":"Yi-Ju Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ju","lastName":"Chiang","id":"38001262800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427529","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Mathematical model","Logistics","Computational modeling","Optimization","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","logistics","numerical analysis","optimisation","profitability","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization technique","logistic economy","cloud computing environment","finite-source queuing systems","cloud platform","cloud backup scheme","server farm profit evaluation","optimal logistic policy","cloud center","contract-based service quality","redundancy strategy","spare decision parameters","repairmen","profit pattern evaluation","comprehensive mathematical analysis","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","finite-source queuing","profit optimization","logistic economy"]}],"abstract":"With the ever-increasing popularity of the cloud platform, cloud backup scheme attracts more attention from both industry and academia. For cloud providers, profit evaluation of server farms is an important issue of cloud computing economics. Optimal logistic policy should be considered to be an indispensible design simultaneously for providing qualified service to cloud users while the whole cloud center is under construction. To maintain contract-based service quality, the administrator of server farm should adopt the necessary redundancy strategy to provide backup servers when some servers fail. To this aim, focusing upon exploring the optimal profit, two decision parameters of spares and repairmen in the system are considered to maintain regulated service quality for the cloud users. The basic point of our approach is that a novel design approach is developed for evaluating the profit patterns using the finite-source queuing theory. A comprehensive mathematical analysis on profit pattern has been made in detail. Numerical simulation has also been conducted to validate the proposed optimization model. The design illustration is presented to demonstrate engineering application scenario in cloud computing environment, hence the proposed approach indeed provides a feasibly cost-effective design framework to meet logistic economy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization technique on logistic economy for cloud computing using finite-source queuing systems","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427529","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427529.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimization technique on logistic economy for cloud computing using finite-source queuing systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427529/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286522","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization technique on logistic economy for cloud computing using finite-source queuing systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"2450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09087S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6427537,"authors":[{"name":"Giancarlo Fortino","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Fortino","id":"37273318600"},{"name":"Mukaddim Pathan","affiliation":["Telstra Corporation Limited, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Mukaddim","lastName":"Pathan","id":"37408275600"},{"name":"Giuseppe Di Fatta","affiliation":["SSE, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Di Fatta","id":"37643693100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427537","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Biomedical monitoring","Computer architecture","Real-time systems","Wireless sensor networks","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","cloud computing","data mining","health care","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BodyCloud","cloud computing","body sensor networks","spatially distributed sensor nodes","contextual data","storage infrastructure","processing infrastructure","online analysis","offline analysis","body sensor data stream mining","body sensor data stream management","body sensor data stream monitoring","resource scalability","resource flexibility","sensor heterogeneity","user dynamic deployment","user management","community applications","healthcare scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body Sensors","Data Mining","Cloud Computing"]}],"abstract":"Spatially distributed sensor nodes can be used to monitor systems and humans conditions in a wide range of application domains.

The concept of constrained sequence alignment is proposed to incorporate the biologist's domain knowledge into sequence alignments such that the user-specified residues/segments are aligned together in the alignment results. Over the past decade, a series of constrained multiple sequence alignment tools were proposed in the literature. GPU-REMuSiC is a newest tool with the regular expression constrains and uses the graphics processing units (GPUs) with CUDA. GPU-REMuSiC can achieve 29\u00d7 speedups for overall computation time by the experimental results. However, the execution environment of GPU-REMuSiC need to build, and it's a threshold for biologists to set up. Therefore, we design an intuitive friendly user interface for the potential cloud server with GPUs. Use the user interface through network, we can send the input data to remote server without cumbersome setting in local host.

The outsourcing however does not allow data owners to outsource the responsibility of confidentiality, integrity and access control, as it still is the responsibility of the data owner. As cloud computing is transparent to both the programmers and the users, it induces challenges that were not present in previous forms of distributed computing. Furthermore, cloud computing enables its users to abstract away from low-level configuration such as configuring IP addresses and routers. It creates an illusion that this entire configuration is automated. This illusion is also true for security services, for instance automating security policies and access control in cloud, so that individuals or end-users using the cloud only perform very high-level (business oriented) configuration. This paper investigates the security challenges posed by the transparency of distribution, abstraction of configuration and automation of services by performing a detailed threat analysis of cloud computing across its different deployment scenarios (private, bursting, federation or multi-clouds). This paper also presents a risk inventory which documents the security threats identified in terms of availability, integrity and confidentiality for cloud infrastructures in detail for future security risks. We also propose a methodology for performing security risk assessment for cloud computing architectures presenting some of the initial results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286567","htmlLink":"/document/6427574/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Security risks and their management in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security risks and their management in cloud computing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090041S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6427585,"authors":[{"name":"Eugen Feller","affiliation":["INRIA Centre Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Eugen","lastName":"Feller","id":"37846586500"},{"name":"Christine Morin","affiliation":["INRIA Centre Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Morin","id":"37284788700"},{"name":"Armel Esnault","affiliation":["ISTIC, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Armel","lastName":"Esnault","id":"38548753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427585","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Topology","Scalability","Algorithm design and analysis","Cloud computing","Peer to peer computing","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","cloud computing","computer centres","computer power supplies","energy conservation","grid computing","peer-to-peer computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized dynamic VMC scheme","cloud computing","energy conservation","cloud data center","virtual machine consolidation","physical machine","PM","peer-to-peer network","first fit decreasing","FFD algorithm","Sercon algorithm","V-MAN algorithm","migration cost aware ACO-based algorithm","Grid 5000 testbed","global packing efficiency","centralized system","P2P network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Dynamic VM Consolidation","Ant Colony Optimization","Unstructured P2P Network","Virtualization"]}],"abstract":"One way to conserve energy in cloud data centers is to transition idle servers into a power saving state during periods of low utilization. Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation (VMC) algorithms are proposed to create idle times by periodically repacking VMs on the least number of physical machines (PMs). Existing works mostly apply VMC on top of centralized, hierarchical, or ring-based system topologies which result in poor scalability and/or packing efficiency with increasing number of PMs and VMs. In this paper, we propose a novel fully decentralized dynamic VMC schema based on an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) network of PMs. The proposed schema is validated using three well known VMC algorithms: First-Fit Decreasing (FFD), Sercon, V-MAN, and a novel migration-cost aware ACO-based algorithm. Extensive experiments performed on the Grid'5000 testbed show that once integrated in our fully decentralized VMC schema, traditional VMC algorithms achieve a global packing efficiency very close to a centralized system. Moreover, the system remains scalable with increasing number of PMs and VMs. Finally, the migration-cost aware ACO-based algorithm outperforms FFD and Sercon in the number of released PMs and requires less migrations than FFD and V-MAN.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427585","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A case for fully decentralized dynamic VM consolidation in clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A case for fully decentralized dynamic VM consolidation in clouds","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427585/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286578","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6427585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case for fully decentralized dynamic VM consolidation in clouds","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.21038S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6427587,"authors":[{"name":"Huaming Wu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Huaming","lastName":"Wu","id":"38548306700"},{"name":"Qiushi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Qiushi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38547740600"},{"name":"Katinka Wolter","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Katinka","lastName":"Wolter","id":"37271285500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427587","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":837},"abstract":"Recently, there emerge a variety of clouds in sky and thus, several similar cloud services (from different cloud venders) can be provided to a mobile end device. The goal of cloud-path selection is to find an optimal cloud among a certain class of clouds that provide the same service, in order to carry out the offloaded computation tasks. It is easy to choose the optimal cloud to save execution time incurred by offloading to cloud when considering only one factor. However, there are many criteria such as speed, bandwidth, price, security and availability that need to be considered when making final decisions. In this paper, a multiple criteria decision analysis approach based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy environment is proposed to decide which cloud is the most suitable one for offloading. The AHP is used to determine the weights of the criteria for cloud-path selection, while fuzzy TOPSIS is to obtain the final ranking of alternative clouds. The numerical analysis is performed to evaluate the model.","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427587.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods of cloud-path selection for offloading in mobile cloud computing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Security","Servers","Availability","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic hierarchy process","cloud computing","fuzzy set theory","mobile computing","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-path selection methods","mobile cloud computing systems","cloud services","mobile end device","optimal cloud selection","execution time saving","cloud offloading","multiple criteria decision analysis approach","analytic hierarchy process","AHP","technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution","criteria weights determination","fuzzy TOPSIS","numerical analysis","model evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","offloading","selection","AHP","TOPSIS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Methods of cloud-path selection for offloading in mobile cloud computing systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427587/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286580","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods of cloud-path selection for offloading in mobile cloud computing systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074147S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6427600,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37292643900"},{"name":"Yu Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404506400"},{"name":"Chao-Hsien Chu","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chao-Hsien","lastName":"Chu","id":"38548067000"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["National Engineering Research, Center for Software Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240284600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427600","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Vehicles","Servers","Data models","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","cloud computing","data acquisition","data analysis","data models","data privacy","information filtering","road traffic","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent transportation system","smart driving","traffic congestion prediction","ITS","pervasive data collection","data security","data privacy","data processing","intelligent analytics","cloud computing architecture","cloud transportation system","user driven crowdsourcing","traffic model construction","data filtering","data modeling","data publish","CTS","intelligent data processing","transportation infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Trasoortation Svstem (CTS)","User-Driven","Cloud Computing","Smart Driving"]}],"abstract":"Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have emerged as an efficient and effective way of alleviating the traffic congestion and improving the performance of transportation systems.

We describe in details the application scenario, system architecture, and core CTS services model. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we have developed a prototype system which elaborated the cloud architecture and other implementation details.

Processing larger data volume leads to higher energy consumption, which in turn causes higher operation expense. Optical interconnects have gained attention recently as a promising solution due to its large bandwidth and high energy efficiency compared to the current networks based on commodity electrical switches. In this paper, we evaluate the energy efficiency of a novel data center network architecture based on optical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology. By utilizing passive optical switch (cyclic arrayed waveguide grating) and parallel signal detection technology to detect multiple optical channels simultaneously with a single photodetector, this architecture offers high energy efficiency. The comparison with a reference design based on commodity electrical switches shows that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption and operation cost significantly while providing higher throughput.","doi":"10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427601","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415464/6427477/06427601.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6427477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient data center network based on a flexible bandwidth MIMO OFDM optical interconnect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427601/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient data center network based on a flexible bandwidth MIMO OFDM optical interconnect","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13286594","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427601/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient data center network based on a flexible bandwidth MIMO OFDM optical interconnect","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"5317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071032S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415464","isNumber":"6427477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415464","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6427477","articleId":"6427601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6427605,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Ashraf","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan","Department of Information Technologies, \u00c5bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland","Turku Centre for Computer Science, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Ashraf","id":"38256723500"},{"name":"Benjamin Byholm","affiliation":["Department of Information Technologies, \u00c5bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Byholm","id":"38489306100"},{"name":"Ivan Porres","affiliation":["Department of Information Technologies, \u00c5bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland","Turku Centre for Computer Science, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Porres","id":"37392051700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4510-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4511-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4509-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6427605","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"abstract":"This paper presents a prediction-based dynamic resource allocation approach for web applications called CRAMP (Cost-efficient Resource Allocation for Multiple web applications with Proactive scaling).

In this paper, we first show the computer simulation result on the localization performance of conventional TOA and TDOA methods in mixed LOS/NLOS environments, and then validate it by theoretical analysis. Here, we analyze the root mean square localization error by decomposing it into two factors; for one factor, which is the contribution from range sampling error, we evaluate it by the Cramer-Rao lower-bound, whereas for the other factor, which is the contribution from positively biased NLOS range error, we analyze it by perturbation method. We show that the theoretical result can well explain the localization performance by computer simulation for both the TOA and TDOA methods, and furthermore, we derive a simple condition among the number of cells, the average and variance of NLOS range error distribution which can correctly predict whether the TDOA method outperforms the TOA method or not for the case of all NLOS channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6473967/06427618.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.110509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.110509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Perturbation Analysis on the Performance of TOA and TDOA Localization in Mixed LOS/NLOS Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer simulation","Channel estimation","Delay","Vectors","Nonlinear optics","Estimation","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","mean square error methods","sampling methods","time-of-arrival estimation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed LOS-NLOS channel environment","cellular communication system","time difference of arrival localization method","time of arrival localization method","TOA","TDOA","range sampling error variance","computer simulation","theoretical analysis","root mean square localization error","Cramer-Rao lower-bound","positively biased NLOS range error","perturbation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TOA","TDOA","NLOS","perturbation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Perturbation Analysis on the Performance of TOA and TDOA Localization in Mixed LOS/NLOS Environments","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6427618/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13355179","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Perturbation Analysis on the Performance of TOA and TDOA Localization in Mixed LOS/NLOS Environments","sourcePdf":"679-tc1302-hara.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08369S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6473967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6473967","articleId":"6427618","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6427619,"authors":[{"name":"Christine A.

Voltage graphs are graphs that have an element of a finite group assigned to each edge, and the assignment determines a specific lift of the graph.

We start with analyzing the performance of finite-length polar codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), while assuming belief propagation as the decoding method. We provide a stopping set analysis for the factor graph of polar codes, where we find the size of the minimum stopping set. We also find the girth of the graph for polar codes. Our analysis along with bit error rate (BER) simulations demonstrate that finite-length polar codes show superior error floor performance compared to the conventional capacity-approaching coding techniques. In order to take advantage from this property while avoiding the shortcomings of polar codes, we consider the idea of combining polar codes with other coding schemes. We propose a polar code-based concatenated scheme to be used in Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) as a potential real-world application. Comparing against conventional concatenation techniques for OTNs, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing methods by closing the gap to the capacity while avoiding error floor, and maintaining a low complexity at the same time.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.110692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.110692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6507371/06427621.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Finite-Length Performance of Polar Codes: Stopping Sets, Error Floor, and Concatenated Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"On Finite-Length Performance of Polar Codes: Stopping Sets, Error Floor, and Concatenated Design","volume":"61","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427621/","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13457559","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427621/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Finite-Length Performance of Polar Codes: Stopping Sets, Error Floor, and Concatenated Design","sourcePdf":"0919-tc1303-eslami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114568S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6507371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6507371","articleId":"6427621","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6427622,"authors":[{"name":"Dianjun Chen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6507371/6427622/6427622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dianjun Chen received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, in 1988, the M.E. degree in radio engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, in 2006.

However, the RBP decoders presented in previous literature suffer from poor convergence error-rate performance due to the two phenomena explored in this paper. The first is the greedy-group phenomenon, which results in a small part of the decoding graph occupying most of the decoding resources. By limiting the number of updates for each edge message in the decoding graph, the proposed Quota-based RBP (Q-RBP) schedule can reduce the probability of greedy groups forming. The other phenomenon is the silent-variable-nodes issue, which is a condition where some variable nodes have no chance of contributing their intrinsic messages to the decoding process. As a result, we propose the Silent-Variable-Node-Free RBP (SVNF-RBP) schedule, which can force all variable nodes to contribute their intrinsic messages to the decoding process equally. Both the Q-RBP and the SVNF-RBP provide appealing convergence speed and convergence error-rate performance compared to previous IDS decoders for both dedicated and punctured LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.120172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.120172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6507371/06427624.pdf","startPage":"886","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Informed Dynamic Scheduling Strategies for Iterative LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Two Informed Dynamic Scheduling Strategies for Iterative LDPC Decoders","volume":"61","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427624/","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13457560","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427624/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Informed Dynamic Scheduling Strategies for Iterative LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"0886-tc1303-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074911S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6507371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6507371","articleId":"6427624","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6427625,"authors":[{"name":"Rimalapudi Sarvendranath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6473967/6427625/6427625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rimalapudi Sarvendranth received his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal in 2009.

However, these constraints limit the secondary system performance. Antenna selection (AS)-based multiple antenna techniques, which exploit spatial diversity with less hardware, help improve secondary system performance. We develop a novel and optimal transmit AS rule that minimizes the symbol error probability (SEP) of an average interference-constrained multiple-input-single-output secondary system that operates in the underlay mode. We show that the optimal rule is a non-linear function of the power gain of the channel from the secondary transmit antenna to the primary receiver and from the secondary transmit antenna to the secondary receive antenna. We also propose a simpler, tractable variant of the optimal rule that performs as well as the optimal rule. We then analyze its SEP with \\tL transmit antennas, and extensively benchmark it with several heuristic selection rules proposed in the literature. We also enhance these rules in order to provide a fair comparison, and derive new expressions for their SEPs. The results bring out new inter-relationships between the various rules, and show that the optimal rule can significantly reduce the SEP.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.120238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6473967/06427625.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.012313.120238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection in Interference-Constrained Underlay Cognitive Radios: SEP-Optimal Rule and Performance Benchmarking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6427625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427625/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection in Interference-Constrained Underlay Cognitive Radios: SEP-Optimal Rule and Performance Benchmarking","volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2013","accessionNumber":"13355180","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427625/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection in Interference-Constrained Underlay Cognitive Radios: SEP-Optimal Rule and Performance Benchmarking","sourcePdf":"496-tc1302-rimal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132502S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6473967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6473967","articleId":"6427625","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6427626,"authors":[{"name":"Biswajit Dutta","affiliation":["Pipal Tech Ventures Limited, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6507371/6427626/6427626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Biswajit Dutta received the B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India in 2007.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify opinion features from online reviews by exploiting the difference in opinion feature statistics across two corpora, one domain-specific corpus (i.e., the given review corpus) and one domain-independent corpus (i.e., the contrasting corpus). We capture this disparity via a measure called domain relevance (DR), which characterizes the relevance of a term to a text collection. We first extract a list of candidate opinion features from the domain review corpus by defining a set of syntactic dependence rules. For each extracted candidate feature, we then estimate its intrinsic-domain relevance (IDR) and extrinsic-domain relevance (EDR) scores on the domain-dependent and domain-independent corpora, respectively. Candidate features that are less generic (EDR score less than a threshold) and more domain-specific (IDR score greater than another threshold) are then confirmed as opinion features. We call this interval thresholding approach the intrinsic and extrinsic domain relevance (IEDR) criterion. Experimental results on two real-world review domains show the proposed IEDR approach to outperform several other well-established methods in identifying opinion features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14078191","htmlLink":"/document/6427744/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identifying Features in Opinion Mining via Intrinsic and Extrinsic Domain Relevance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Features in Opinion Mining via Intrinsic and Extrinsic Domain Relevance","sourcePdf":"ttk2014030623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076225S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6731358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6731358","articleId":"6427744","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6427747,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Sarwat","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6824283/6427747/sarwa-29-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Sarwat is a Doctoral candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items; LARS*, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS* exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS* exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS* can apply these techniques separately, or together, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the MovieLens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS* is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.29","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6824283/06427747.pdf","startPage":"1384","endPage":"1399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LARS*: An Efficient and Scalable Location-Aware Recommender System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"LARS*: An Efficient and Scalable Location-Aware Recommender System","volume":"26","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349413","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6427747/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6427747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LARS*: An Efficient and Scalable Location-Aware Recommender System","sourcePdf":"tkde-sarwat-29-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101957S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6824283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6824283","articleId":"6427747","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6428584,"authors":[{"name":"Qunbi Zhuge","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Qunbi Zhuge was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1987.

We begin by proposing a pre-emphasized pilot subcarrier (PEPS) approach to reduce the pilot subcarrier overhead for the following IS-CPR algorithms. Then, we show a statistical analysis of the DEPN-induced ISPS between subcarriers within one symbol, which is related to the accumulated chromatic dispersion (CD). Next, three algorithms are proposed for IS-CPR including maximum-likelihood (ML) phase estimation, digital phase-locked loop (DPLL), and feedforward carrier recovery (FFCR) employing either the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\nth power scheme in case of QPSK modulation or the QPSK partitioning scheme for the 16-QAM case.

Motion errors are space variant according to the data acquisition geometry, which can be split into range-variant and azimuth-variant components. In the processing of wide-beam SAR data, the azimuth variance must be considered. Several approaches have been proposed, among which the subaperture algorithm based on frequency division (FD) is a good choice if motion errors involve high-frequency components. However, there are two drawbacks to using this algorithm in conditions where the magnitude of motion errors is large, i.e., the invalidation of the time-frequency relation in an FD with too many subapertures and paired echoes caused by periodic discontinuities in the azimuth phase history. Theoretical analysis and simulations are presented to demonstrate these two drawbacks. Improvements are then made on the traditional algorithm: implementing the FD after the subaperture MoCo instead of before it and adopting a nonuniform FD scheme rather than a uniform one. Finally, the validity of the improved algorithm is further demonstrated by experimental results with real data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6531644/06428596.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2236817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2236817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements to the Frequency Division-Based Subaperture Algorithm for Motion Compensation in Wide-Beam SAR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Synthetic aperture radar","Motion compensation","Doppler effect","History","Frequency conversion","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","motion compensation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division based subaperture algorithm","motion compensation","wide beam SAR","airborne synthetic aperture radar","motion errors","subaperture MoCo"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency division (FD)-based subaperture algorithm","motion compensation (MoCo)","paired echo suppression","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","time\u2013frequency relation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improvements to the Frequency Division-Based Subaperture Algorithm for Motion Compensation in Wide-Beam SAR","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6428596/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13566323","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements to the Frequency Division-Based Subaperture Algorithm for Motion Compensation in Wide-Beam SAR","sourcePdf":"lgrs-li-2236817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069203S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6531644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6531644","articleId":"6428596","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6428598,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Anthony Haigh","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Paul Anthony","lastName":"Haigh","id":"38561317500"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Ioannis Papakonstantinou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papakonstantinou","id":"37271094800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6428598","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1017},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organic light emitting diodes","Modulation","Bit rate","Bit error rate","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical modulation","organic light emitting diodes","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["white organic LED transmission system","discrete multitone modulation","organic light emitting diode","visible light communications","quadrature modulation","orthogonally spaced frequencies","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","bit rate 1.4 Mbit/s","bit rate 550 kbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete multitone","organic light emitting diode","visible light communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428598","abstract":"In this letter, we experimentally demonstrate the discrete multitone (DMT) modulation scheme for organic light emitting diode-based visible light communications (OLED-VLC).

We show that it is possible to recover signals up to 1.4 Mb/s with an OLED of bandwidth less than 100 kHz, which is an increase of over 14 times.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2013.2244879","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6469235/06428598.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"618","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2013.2244879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6469235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1.4-Mb/s White Organic LED Transmission System Using Discrete Multitone Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"1.4-Mb/s White Organic LED Transmission System Using Discrete Multitone Modulation","volume":"25","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13353555","publicationDate":"March15, 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6428598/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1.4-Mb/s White Organic LED Transmission System Using Discrete Multitone Modulation","sourcePdf":"lpt-haigh-2244879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04398S","chronDate":"March15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6469235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6469235","articleId":"6428598","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6428599,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shiva","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37277183600"},{"name":"Jing Shao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Shao","id":"38548712300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6428599","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber dispersion","Optical fiber amplifiers","Fiber gratings","Fiber nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","optical fibre dispersion","optical phase conjugation","optimisation","Schrodinger equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal step size","fiber optic transmission systems","optical back propagation scheme","optical phase conjugator","fiber Bragg gratings","highly nonlinear fibers","transmission fiber dispersion","nonlinear Schrodinger equation","split-step Fourier scheme","optimum accumulated dispersion","FBG","optimum nonlinear phase shift","HNLF","stepwise approximation","Lagrange multipliers","optimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chromatic dispersion (CD)","digital backward propagation","nonlinear effect","nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE)","optical backward propagation"]}],"abstract":"An optical back propagation scheme consisting of an optical phase conjugator, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), and highly nonlinear fibers (HNLFs) is investigated.

These two antennas operate at the LTE-A frequencies 698-960 MHz and 1710-2690 MHz with good efficiency, owing to a novel dual-branch impedance matching circuit which utilizes the properties of the CCE and the chassis in a proficient way. A third antenna based on the same CCE is designed for a software defined radio receiver.

Physiologically realistic live microHuman (\u03bcHu) and milliHuman (mHu) systems operating for weeks to months present exciting and important engineering challenges such as determining the appropriate size for each organ to ensure appropriate relative organ functional activity, achieving appropriate cell density, providing the requisite universal perfusion media, sensing the breadth of physiological responses, and maintaining stable control of the entire system, while maintaining fluid scaling that consists of ~5 mL for the mHu and ~5 \u03bcL for the \u03bcHu. We believe that successful mHu and \u03bcHu systems for drug development and systems biology will require low-volume microdevices that support chemical signaling, microfabricated pumps, valves and microformulators, automated optical microscopy, electrochemical sensors for rapid metabolic assessment, ion mobility-mass spectrometry for real-time molecular analysis, advanced bioinformatics, and machine learning algorithms for automated model inference and integrated electronic control. Toward this goal, we are building functional prototype components and are working toward top-down system integration.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Engineering Challenges for Instrumenting and

The estimation method proposed involves four steps. First, the bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) of the received signal is estimated from the measurements. Second, the BRCS measurements are calibrated to agree with existing theoretical and empirical wind-wave models. Next, a geometric optics-based scattering model is used to estimate the sea surface slopes, based on the reflection geometry and the measured BRCS. Finally, the surface winds are estimated using an empirically derived function relating the surface mean square slopes to near-surface wind speed. The accuracy of the proposed inversion technique is then tested using a set of 25 space-based GNSS reflection measurements over a range of wind speeds. These measurements were all taken in the proximity of ocean buoys which provided in situ ocean wind speed information. The wind estimates from the buoys were then compared with the wind retrievals made from the measurements and found to be accurate to a root-mean-square error of 1.84 m/s. Additionally, the potential error sources in the measurements are analyzed, including a simulation of the effects of wind direction on the BRCS measurements. This first demonstration of space-based GNSS scatterometry using a small set of sample measurements will hopefully provide a benchmark and example for future experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"4853","endPage":"4863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588578","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6588578/06428645.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea measurements","Sea surface","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","Signal to noise ratio","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","wind"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-based GNSS scatterometry","ocean wind sensing","empirically calibrated model","near-surface wind sensing","Global Navigation Satellite Systems","GNSS signals","bistatic radar cross section","BRCS measurements","theoretical wind-wave model","empirical wind-wave model","geometric optics-based scattering model","sea surface slopes","reflection geometry","near-surface wind speed","inversion technique","space-based GNSS reflection measurements","ocean buoys","ocean wind speed information","root-mean-square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bistatic radar","Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS)","Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)","GPS","reflectometry","scatterometry","wind sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space-Based GNSS Scatterometry: Ocean Wind Sensing Using an Empirically Calibrated Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428645/","volume":"51","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6428645/","accessionNumber":"13748077","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Based GNSS Scatterometry: Ocean Wind Sensing Using an Empirically Calibrated Model","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gleason-2230401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068761S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6588578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6588578","articleId":"6428645","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":6428649,"authors":[{"name":"Haiwen Liu","affiliation":["East China of Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Haiwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405290300"},{"name":"Wenyuan Xu","affiliation":["East China of Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Wenyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"38547960900"},{"name":"Zhichong Zhang","affiliation":["East China of Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Zhichong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537912100"},{"name":"Xuehui Guan","affiliation":["East China of Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Xuehui","lastName":"Guan","id":"37534353600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6428649","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1902},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slotline","Microstrip","Loss measurement","Passband","Admittance","Wireless communication","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonators","slot lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact diplexer","slotline stepped impedance resonator","slotline hairpin stepped SIR","out-of-band rejection","geometrical parameter ratio","microstrip-slotline transition","circuit size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diplexer","slotline","stepped impedance resonator (SIR)","transition"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a compact diplexer is implemented by using slotline hairpin stepped impedance resonator (SIR) in ground plane.

Experimental validation shows that the emulation system exhibits good accuracy ( > 97% at 1 kOhm magnitude) in the frequency range 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The digitally configurability offers advantages in flexibility, repeatability, and cost-efficient compared to more traditional approaches, simplifying the validation process of electrical impedance tomography systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13686311","pubMedId":"23893205","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Bioimpedance Emulation System for Electrical Impedance Tomography System Validation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Bioimpedance Emulation System for Electrical Impedance Tomography System Validation","sourcePdf":"tbcas-li-2224110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033045S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","isNumber":"6567923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6428655","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6428662,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chi Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Wei-Chi Lai was born in Taichung, Taiwan, in 1982.

To enable the proper function of a 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO-OFDM receiver this work proposes a low-complexity preamble-assisted solution using only one complex divider and one complex multiplier to handle significant FDI distortions. An all-digital multiphase and multi-rate clock generator (MPRCG) was built to support fast dynamic frequency scaling for FDI estimation and compensation and for efficient implementation. Based on the proposed MPRCG, a skew calibration was also realized to tune I/Q timing coherently via multiphase A/D clocking. Performance evaluation showed that the proposed approach incurs an SNR loss of 1.5 dB to maintain a packet-error rate of less than 10% under a 1 dB gain error, 15 phase error and worse filter mismatch. Thus, this solution not only provides adequate performance, but also makes FDI estimation and compensation more cost-effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428662/","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6428662/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13786051","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Cost-Effective Preamble-Assisted Engine With Skew Calibrator for Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance in 4x4 MIMO-OFDM Modem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cost-Effective Preamble-Assisted Engine With Skew Calibrator for Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance in 4x4 MIMO-OFDM Modem","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lai-2239431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149808S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6567958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6567958","articleId":"6428662","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6428667,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick McNabb","affiliation":["Durham University, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Patrick McNabb (M'10) received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in the field of power system dynamics and stability from the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He is a research associate at Durham University, Durham, U.K."]},"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"McNabb","id":"37591109100"},{"name":"Douglas Wilson","affiliation":["Psymetrix Ltd, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Douglas Wilson (M'04) received the B.Eng (Hons) degree in mechanical and electrical engineering and the and Ph.D. degree from the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 1991 and 1997, respectively, and the M.Sc. degree in power systems from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 2006.","He is Chief Technical Officer of Psymetrix Ltd, an Alstom-owned company specializing in WAMS, smart grid applications and management and control of dynamics.

Power systems are complex with vast amounts of data being collected from measurements made via wide-area measurement (WAMS) and SCADA systems. Classification trees are introduced as a means to handle vast quantities of powerflow data which can be used to classify mode damping and amplitude. In reality, the classification trees would be trained on real power system data from SCADA and WAMS. A case study based on real field data from the Ecuadorian power system is presented where interconnectors to Colombia tripped in response to a poorly damped mode of oscillation. Testing of this methodology shows the feasibility of this approach with accurate classification of mode damping and amplitude on training and testing data sets. By highlighting significant variables affecting mode damping and amplitude, a decision tool for system operators can be developed that will suggest the optimal course of action to remedy any near instability or unstable electromechanical oscillations in transmission networks.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2240022","startPage":"1988","endPage":"1996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06428667.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2240022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of mode damping and amplitude in power systems using synchrophasor measurements and classification trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power system stability","Generators","Classification tree analysis","Power system dynamics","Position measurement","Wide area measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","phasor measurement","power system stability","power transmission reliability","SCADA systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mode damping classification","synchrophasor measurements","classification trees","mode damping prediction","powerflow data","power system model","wide-area measurement","WAMS","SCADA systems","amplitude classification","Ecuadorian power system","Colombia","interconnectors","oscillation mode damping","optimal course","electromechanical oscillation instability","transmission networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromechanical modes","oscillation source location","small signal stability","wide-area measurement system (WAMS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Classification of mode damping and amplitude in power systems using synchrophasor measurements and classification trees","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6428667/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13934076","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of mode damping and amplitude in power systems using synchrophasor measurements and classification trees","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-mcnabb-2240022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074951S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6428667","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6428669,"authors":[{"name":"Shutao Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6588578/6428669/6428669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shutao Li (M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 1995, 1997, and 2001, respectively.","From May to October 2001, he was a Research Associate with the Department of Computer Science, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

In this paper, a remote sensing image fusion method is proposed with sparse representations over learned dictionaries. The dictionaries for PAN image and low-resolution MS image are learned from the source images adaptively. Furthermore, a novel strategy is designed to construct the dictionary for unknown high-resolution MS images without training set, which can make our proposed method more practical. The sparse coefficients of the PAN image and low-resolution MS image are sought by the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Then, the fused high-resolution MS image is calculated by combining the obtained sparse coefficients and the dictionary for the high-resolution MS image. By comparing with six well-known methods in terms of several universal quality evaluation indexes with or without references, the simulated and real experimental results on QuickBird and IKONOS images demonstrate the superiority of our method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6588578/06428669.pdf","startPage":"4779","endPage":"4789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2230332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote Sensing Image Fusion via Sparse Representations Over Learned Dictionaries","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Spatial resolution","Remote sensing","Image fusion","Indexes","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image fusion","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["panchromatic image","low-resolution multispectral image","remote sensing image fusion method","PAN image sparse coefficients","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","fused high-resolution MS image","sparse coefficients","QuickBird image","IKONOS image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dictionary learning","image fusion","multispectral (MS) image","panchromatic (PAN) image","remote sensing","sparse representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Remote Sensing Image Fusion via Sparse Representations Over Learned Dictionaries","volume":"51","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6428669/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13748081","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Sensing Image Fusion via Sparse Representations Over Learned Dictionaries","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2230332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108594S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6588578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"6588578","articleId":"6428669","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6428673,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher G.

Usually, to obtain good control performance, the electric drives of this kind of motor require one position, one dc link, and at least two current sensors. Failure of any of these sensors might lead to degraded system performance or even instability. As such, sensor fault resilient control becomes a very important issue in modern drive systems. This paper proposes a novel sensor fault detection and isolation algorithm based on an extended Kalman filter. It is robust to system random noise and efficient in real-time implementation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is compact and can detect and isolate all the sensor faults for IPMSM drives. Thorough theoretical analysis is provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven by extensive experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation Method in Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drives Based on an Extended Kalman Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2244537","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6497104/06428675.pdf","startPage":"3485","endPage":"3495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2244537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6497104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation Method in Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drives Based on an Extended Kalman Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6428675/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13431034","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation Method in Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drives Based on an Extended Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2244537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100937S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6497104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"6497104","articleId":"6428675","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6428700,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Bhatnagar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Bhatnagar","id":"37660358000"},{"name":"Q.

The main motivation is to capture most relevant information from sources into a single output, which plays an important role in medical diagnosis. In this paper, a novel fusion framework is proposed for multimodal medical images based on non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The source medical images are first transformed by NSCT followed by combining low- and high-frequency components. Two different fusion rules based on phase congruency and directive contrast are proposed and used to fuse low- and high-frequency coefficients. Finally, the fused image is constructed by the inverse NSCT with all composite coefficients. Experimental results and comparative study show that the proposed fusion framework provides an effective way to enable more accurate analysis of multimodality images. Further, the applicability of the proposed framework is carried out by the three clinical examples of persons affected with Alzheimer, subacute stroke and recurrent tumor.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2244870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6558949/06428700.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2244870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6558949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directive Contrast Based Multimodal Medical Image Fusion in NSCT Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428700/","displayDocTitle":"Directive Contrast Based Multimodal Medical Image Fusion in NSCT Domain","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13735933","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directive Contrast Based Multimodal Medical Image Fusion in NSCT Domain","sourcePdf":"tmm-bhatnagar-2244870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094851S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","isNumber":"6558949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"229","articleId":"6428700","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6428710,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Mei","affiliation":["Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Technology & Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6513254/6428710/6428710-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Mei (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree in radio engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University.

This new modulation method is based on selective virtual loop mapping, to achieve dynamic capacitor voltage balance without the help of an extra compensation signal. The concept of virtual submodule (VSM) is first established, and by changing the loop mapping relationships between the VSMs and the real submodules, the voltages of the upper/lower arm's capacitors can be well balanced. This method does not requiring sorting voltages from highest to lowest, and just identifies the MIN and MAX capacitor voltage's index which makes it suitable for a modular multilevel converter with a large number of submodules in one arm. Compared to carrier phase-shifted PWM (CPSPWM), this method is more easily to be realized in field-programmable gate array and has much stronger dynamic regulation ability, and is conducive to the control of circulating current. Its feasibility and validity have been verified by simulations and experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6513254/06428710.pdf","startPage":"5063","endPage":"5073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2243758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular Multilevel Inverter with New Modulation Method and Its Application to Photovoltaic Grid-Connected Generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Pulse width modulation","Voltage control","Inverters","Indexes","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","photovoltaic power systems","power capacitors","power grids","PWM invertors","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circulating current control","field-programmable gate array","CPSPWM","carrier phase-shifted PWM","MAX capacitor voltage index","MIN capacitor voltage index","voltages sorting","upper-lower arm capacitor","VSM","loop mapping relationship","virtual submodule","dynamic capacitor voltage","selective virtual loop mapping","PDPWM","phase disposition pulse width modulation","photovoltaic grid-connected generator","modular multilevel inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic voltage balance","modular multilevel converter (MMC)","phase disposition pulse width modulation (PDPWM)","Photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected","selective virtual loop mapping (SVLM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modular Multilevel Inverter with New Modulation Method and Its Application to Photovoltaic Grid-Connected Generator","volume":"28","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6428710/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13487522","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular Multilevel Inverter with New Modulation Method and Its Application to Photovoltaic Grid-Connected Generator","sourcePdf":"tpel-mei-2243758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112087S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6513254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"6513254","articleId":"6428710","onlineDate":"01 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6428727,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche 8506, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00c9lectricit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6557008/6428727/6428727-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Di Renzo (S'05\u2013AM'07\u2013M'09) was born in L'Aquila, Italy, in 1978.

The contribution is threefold: 1) The achievable transmit diversity of SM-MIMO is analytically studied by analyzing the impact of various design parameters, notably spatial constellation diagram and shaping filters at the transmitter; 2) the design of SM-MIMO providing transmit diversity and maximum-likelihood (ML) optimum single-stream decoding is investigated; and 3) via Monte Carlo simulations, a comprehensive performance assessment of SM-MIMO against state-of-the-art MIMO (e.g., spatial multiplexing, orthogonal space-time block codes, Golden code, and double space-time transmit diversity) is conducted. It is shown that, for many system setups, a properly designed SM-MIMO outperforms, with lower decoding complexity, state-of-the-art MIMO.

Noise gets added to an image during image capture, transmission, or processing and degrades the performance of any image processing algorithms. Prior to de-noising step, the image should be tested for the identification of noise. Though Several approaches have been introduced in literature earlier for noise identification, each has its own assumption, advantages are not generic. This paper proposes a novel method based on statistical features with neural network classifier to identify the different types of noises such as Additive white Gaussian Noise, Salt & pepper Noise, Speckle Noise in the image without the human intervention. Extensive simulations on variety of images show that the proposed method effectively identifies the noise in a given image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428761/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13286620","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6428761/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic noise identification in images using moments and neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic noise identification in images using moments and neural network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"IPD04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046154S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416127","isNumber":"6428740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416127","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6428740","articleId":"6428761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6428763,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Several distortions limit the quality of digital images during image acquisition, formation, storage and transmission. Impulse noise is introduced in the images from some digital sources due to acquisition error or transmission error or a problem in the ground processing systems. In this paper, an efficient edge preserving impulse noise removal technique has been proposed. The algorithm has been simulated on MATLAB and implemented using FPGA. The results show that the proposed technique preserves the finer edge details of the image during the impulse noise removal process. The technique has high performance in terms of qualitative analysis as well as visual quality using PSNR and MAE. Also, synthesis results prove that the design is of low computational complexity and lesser hardware cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Image edge detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Image reconstruction","PSNR","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","field programmable gate arrays","image denoising","impulse noise","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge preserving algorithm","FPGA","camera sensors","faulty memory locations","noisy channel transmission","digital image quality","image distortion","image acquisition","image formation","image storage","image transmission","digital sources","acquisition error","transmission error","edge preserving impulse noise removal technique","MATLAB","edge details","qualitative analysis","visual quality","PSNR","MAE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image denoising","Impulse noise","Edge preserving","FPGA","PSNR","MAE"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428763","doi":"10.1109/MVIP.2012.6428763","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6416127/6428740/06428763.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MVIP.2012.6428763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428763/","displayDocTitle":"Edge preserving algorithm for impulse noise removal using FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13286622","htmlLink":"/document/6428763/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge preserving algorithm for impulse noise removal using FPGA","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"IPD06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056746S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6416127","isNumber":"6428740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6416127","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6428740","articleId":"6428763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6428771,"authors":[{"name":"V K Veena","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"V K","lastName":"Veena"},{"name":"G Jyothish Lal","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Jyothish Lal"},{"name":"S.

We first briefly survey these challenges and their potential impact on the design of efficient algorithms for several fundamental problems in CRAHNs. Then, we describe our recent contributions to the capacity maximization problem [29] and the connectivity problem [32]. The capacity maximization problem is to maximize the overall throughput utility among multiple unicast sessions; the connectivity problem is to find a connected subgraph from the given cognitive radio network where each secondary node is equipped with multiple radios. By assuming the physical interference model and asynchronous communications, we reformulate the above two problems where the capacity maximization problem is to find the maximum number of simultaneously transmitting links in secondary networks, and the connectivity problem is to construct a spanning tree over secondary networks using the fewest timeslots. We discuss the challenging issues for designing distributed approximation algorithms and give a preliminary framework for solving these two problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428799/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13287200","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6428799/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computing Capacity and Connectivity in Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing Capacity and Connectivity in Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"San Marcos, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4930a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117863S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424101","isNumber":"6428797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6428797","articleId":"6428799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6428800,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Ji","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China","College of Physical Science and Technology, Dalian University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Changqing","lastName":"Ji","id":"38492366000"},{"name":"Yu Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Li","id":"38493240900"},{"name":"Wenming Qiu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wenming","lastName":"Qiu","id":"38493283100"},{"name":"Uchechukwu Awada","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Uchechukwu","lastName":"Awada","id":"38547803600"},{"name":"Keqiu Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Keqiu","lastName":"Li","id":"37277619000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5064-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4930-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"CD","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-527X"}],"articleNumber":"6428800","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":133,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9257},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Big Data Processing in Cloud Computing Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Data models","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data handling","distributed databases","network theory (graphs)","optimisation","parallel processing","social sciences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing environments","large-scale data analysis","large-scale data management","application aspects","system aspects","cloud data management","big data processing mechanisms","cloud architecture","cloud database","data storage scheme","MapReduce parallel processing","MapReduce optimization strategies","open issues"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big Data","Cloud Computing","Data Management","Distributed Computing"]}],"abstract":"With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network analysis, semantic Web analysis and bioinformatics network analysis, a variety of data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase.

Cloud computing, while providing high performance, is very costly. Google and Microsoft Bing spend billions of dollars each year to maintain their server farms, mainly due to the high power bills. On the other hand, mobile computing is under a very tight energy budget, but yet the end users demand ever increasing performance on these devices. This trend indicates that conventional architectures are not able to deliver high-performance and low power consumption at the same time, and we need a new architecture model to address the needs of both extremes. In this paper, we thus introduce our Extremely Heterogeneous Architecture (EHA) project: EHA is a novel architecture that incorporates both general-purpose and specialized cores on the same chip. The general-purpose cores take care of generic control and computation. On the other hand, the specialized cores, including GPU, hard accelerators (ASIC accelerators), and soft accelerators (FPGAs), are designed for accelerating frequently used or heavy weight applications. When acceleration is not needed, the specialized cores are turned off to reduce power consumption. We demonstrate that EHA is able to improve performance through acceleration, and at the same time reduce power consumption. Since EHA is a heterogeneous architecture, it is suitable for accelerating heterogeneous workloads on the same chip. For example, data centers and clouds provide many services, including media streaming, searching, indexing, scientific computations. The ultimate goal of the EHA project is two-fold: first, to design a chip that is able to run different cloud services on it, and through this design, we would be able to greatly reduce the cost, both recurring and non-recurring, of data centers\\clouds, second, to design a light-weight EHA that runs on mobile devices, providing end users with improved experience even under tight battery budget constraints.","doi":"10.1109/I-SPAN.2012.11","publicationTitle":"2012 12th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 12th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6424101/6428797/06428802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I-SPAN.2012.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428797","startPage":"30","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EHA: The Extremely Heterogeneous Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EHA: The Extremely Heterogeneous Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428802/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13287203","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6428802/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EHA: The Extremely Heterogeneous Architecture","confLoc":"San Marcos, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4930a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04777S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6424101","isNumber":"6428797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6424101","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6428797","articleId":"6428802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6428828,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Huang","id":"38548558200"},{"name":"Wenjian Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Posts and Telecommunications Planning and Designing Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38547754500"},{"name":"Lei Fang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Posts and Telecommunications Planning and Designing Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Fang","id":"38548261500"},{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["Jiangsu Posts and Telecommunications Planning and Designing Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"He","id":"38547029100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5064-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4930-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"CD","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-527X"}],"articleNumber":"6428828","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"The paper quantizes the joint effects of finite rate and delay of feedback channel on the performance of downlink transmissions and the coverage in co-channel multi-antenna tiered macro/femto networks.

Based on the quality of service (QoS) constraints, the radius of macrocell maximum coverage and no-coverage femtocell radius are obtained respectively.

Furthermore, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm borrowing the operation of selection and crossover from genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to train the FNN-based estimator model. This hybrid algorithm can incorporate the superiorities of the two heuristic optimization techniques. The results of simulation and experiment demonstrate that the improved PSO algorithm is more adaptive to the initial value of the parameters than the traditional training method using the back propagation (BP) algorithm. The FNN model trained by the improved PSO algorithm has better generalization capacity. At the same class of the training accuracy, higher accurate estimation value of BSOC can be obtained by employing the improved PSO algorithm.

IA is a multiplexing gain optimal strategy at the expense of requiring the global channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. Most previous works assume the availability of perfect CSI which is not possible in practice. The performance of IA algorithms based on perfect CSI drop dramatically in circumstance where CSI errors exist. In this paper we propose a robust minimum mean square error (MMSE) IA algorithm with imperfect CSI. Based on a Gaussian statistic channel error model, we give the mean square error objective function with per transmitter power constraint. The objective function is not joint convex in precoders and decoders, but convex in precoders with fixed decoders and vice versa. We convert the problem to two convex sub problems and iteratively find the solutions. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm when CSI errors exist.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.53","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","startPage":"197","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06428885.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Interference","MIMO","Transmitters","Decoding","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","Gaussian channels","least mean squares methods","multi-access systems","multiplexing","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error objective function","MMSE interference alignment","global channel state information","CSI","multiuser wireless communication","multiplexing gain optimal strategy","Gaussian statistic channel error model","transmitter power constraint","precoders","decoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interference alignment","imperfect CSI","minimum mean square error","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MMSE Interference Alignment with Imperfect CSI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428885/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6428885/","accessionNumber":"13289698","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Interference Alignment with Imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071347S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6428885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6428894,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Peng Gao","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Li-Peng","lastName":"Gao","id":"38548709700"},{"name":"Jian Liu","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Liu","id":"38547517500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6428894","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Low pass filters","Field programmable gate arrays","Filtering algorithms","Band pass filters","Filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","decoding","digital radio","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","minimum shift keying","mixers (circuits)","radio receivers","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic identification system","dual-channel AIS digital receiver","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","mixer","FIR filter","FM decoder","GMSK decoder","equipment reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital receiver","band pass sample","digital filter","CORDIC","digital quadrature mixer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6428894","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.61","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","abstract":"A design of dual-channel digital AIS (Automatic Identification System) receiver based on FPGA is introduced.

This paper reviews the protocols of the research which have already carried out and through comparison and analysis, we put forward new ideas for further research.","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.156","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06428990.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"643","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Energy-saving Routing Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6428990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Energy-saving Routing Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13289799","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6428990/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Energy-saving Routing Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935a638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059078S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6428990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6429010,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37066674000"},{"name":"Xuejun Sha","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Sha","id":"37294263700"},{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38490906200"},{"name":"Xiaojie Fang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojie","lastName":"Fang","id":"38547857200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429010","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) is a novel theory for simultaneous data sampling and compression. The block compressed sensing can reduce the computation complexity and storage space for compressed sensing. In this paper, the weight-block compressed sensing technique coupled with the edge information is presented for improving the reconstructed image quality. Firstly, we segment the original image into block by block. Based on the edge characteristic of every sub-block, we will select the different measurements that needed for each block. This algorithm can preserve the edge and reduce the aliasing in comparison to the traditional block-compressed sensing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the PSNR comparing with the usual method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429010.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"727","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Weight-Block Compressed Sensing and its Application to Image Reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","TV","Minimization","Image edge detection","Image reconstruction","Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","data compression","edge detection","image reconstruction","image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","data sampling","data compression","computational complexity","storage space","weight-block compressed sensing technique","edge information","reconstructed image quality","subblock edge characteristics","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","block","weight-block","sampling rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Weight-Block Compressed Sensing and its Application to Image Reconstruction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6429010/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13307696","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Weight-Block Compressed Sensing and its Application to Image Reconstruction","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935a723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143808S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6429029,"authors":[{"name":"Yuwu Lu","affiliation":["Bio-computing research center, Shenzhen Graduate School, Key laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yuwu","lastName":"Lu","id":"38548607100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429029","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Face recognition","Color","Databases","Principal component analysis","Training","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","grey systems","image fusion","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel method","color face recognition","two phase test sample sparse representation method","TPTSR","gray images","fusion scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","color channel","fusion scheme","weight coefficient"]}],"abstract":"A two-phase test sample sparse representation method (TPTSR) attracted wide attentions for its good performance after it had been proposed.

Waveform design is a principal important issue before radar imaging successfully in MIMO. There are two main requirements for the waveform used in MIMO radar imaging: the signals should be orthogonal and its auto-correlation function should have low side lobe noise and narrow main lobe. This paper analyses statistical characteristics of random stepped frequency (RSF) signal's auto-correlation deeply and proves that large stepped frequency number is suitable for MIMO imaging radar. Then a method for designing random stepped frequency-coding waveforms by modified genetic algorithm is presented here. A random matrix is used for initializing the genetic algorithm, and annealing algorithm is applied here for avoiding GA's disadvantages such as prematurity. In the end we compare the waveforms designed by GA and MGA and apply the waveforms in MIMO radar imaging simulation, the result proves that it is suitable for overcoming interfere among MIMO radar channels and imaging target.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429053.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"913","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Design Based on Modified Genetic Algorithm for MIMO Radar Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","MIMO radar","Frequency modulation","Imaging","MIMO","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","radar imaging","random codes","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform design","modified genetic algorithm","MIMO radar imaging system","wideband signal processing","low side lobe noise","narrow main lobe","statistical characteristics","random stepped frequency signal autocorrelation funtion","RSF signal autocorrelation function","random stepped frequency-coding waveforms","random matrix","simulated annealing algorithm","MIMO radar channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","random stepped frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Design Based on Modified Genetic Algorithm for MIMO Radar Imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6429053/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289855","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Design Based on Modified Genetic Algorithm for MIMO Radar Imaging","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935a909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06902S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6429056,"authors":[{"name":"Shikai Zuo","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shikai","lastName":"Zuo","id":"38547269400"},{"name":"Mingjiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shengzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Mingjiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38546907200"},{"name":"Liyi Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shengzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Liyi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37539977500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429056","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Bandwidth","Hardware design languages","Streaming media","Memory management","Video coding","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","hardware description languages","image reconstruction","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache hardware design","H.264 encoder","reference images","top-level framework definition","Verilog HDL","RTL coding","TSMC technology library","data memory bandwidth","power consumption","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264","inter-frame","TLB","Cache"]}],"abstract":"On the oretical basis of the inter-frame motion compensation of H.264 encoder, this paper proposed a new cache which adopted the LFU(lease frequently used) replace mechanism and a new prefetching method of reference images which have been reconstructed in H.264 encoder.

With the help of compressive sensing techniques, sub-Nyquist rate samples are acquired, and utilized to detect frequency subbands via a wavelet-based edge detector. Then a double-threshold energy detector is used to realize the multi-resolution spectrum detection.

So cooperative spectrum sensing among cognitive radio nodes is needed in order to overcome these drawbacks. However it will result in a large demand of communication bandwidth on the control channel when the number of the nodes is great. To this problem, this paper proposes a twice cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. In this scheme, all secondary users are grouped into multiple clusters. Double threshold cooperative sensing algorithm and hard fusion ruling are adopted respectively in each cluster and fusion centre. By adopting this scheme, the number of bits transmitted to the fusion centre for decision result will be decreased. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme can improve the detection performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1113","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429097.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twice Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6429097/","displayDocTitle":"Twice Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13289897","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twice Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935b110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049969S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6429100,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Bi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, College of Engineering, YanBian University, YanJi, China"],"firstName":"Dong Bi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38547007400"},{"name":"Hui-Min Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, College of Engineering, YanBian University, YanJi, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Min","lastName":"Wang","id":"38546935100"},{"name":"Yi-Nan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, College of Engineering, YanBian University, YanJi, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Nan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37066214100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429100","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Loss measurement","Markov processes","Steady-state","Radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","CSMA","unslotted cognitive radio network","nonsaturation condition","carrier sense multiple access","unslotted multichannel cognitive radio network","exponential distributed time","continuous time Markov chain","SUs impact","non-saturation condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Network","CSMA","Non-saturation condition","Backoff time","Throughput"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.264","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429100.pdf","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of CSMA in an Unslotted Cognitive Radio Network under Non-saturation Condition","abstract":"The performance of carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) in an unslotted multi-channel cognitive radio network under non-saturation condition is studied.

Using this Algorithm firstly we should code a query sample as a sparse linear combination of all the training samples. Secondly we need to classify it by evaluating which class leads to the minimum representation error. The dimension of imagery data is typically very high and that makes it computationally costly to process high-resolution images. It is widely believed that the - norm sparsity[4] constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the success of SRC. The theory of compressed sensing(CS) offers an useful method to reduce the face dimension. The basic principles of CS can reduce much lower-dimensional measurements of the images, without significantly compromising recognition performance. In order to get the Optimal sparse solution, we need to improve the sparse representation Algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Algorithm Based on Compressive Sensing and SRC","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.342","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429178.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Algorithm Based on Compressive Sensing and SRC","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6429178/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13307719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Algorithm Based on Compressive Sensing and SRC","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935b460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057424S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6429182,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Han","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","School of Computer, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Han","id":"37708450600"},{"name":"Jinying Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jinying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601194400"},{"name":"Baoliang Li","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Baoliang","lastName":"Li","id":"38542490500"},{"name":"Jia Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Lu","id":"37897778600"},{"name":"Wenhua Dou","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Dou","id":"37284449700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429182","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation","Finite element methods","Solids","Acoustics","Arrays","Fluids","Pistons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","modules","partial differential equations","piezoelectric devices","ultrasonic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM method","ultrasonic transducer","nondestructive testing evaluation","NDT&E","imaging application","ultrasonic wave propagation","finite element method","partial differential equation","PDE","COMSOL","multiphysics coupling module","piezoelectric solid","nonpiezoelectric solid","wave mode visualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic Wave","FEM Modeling","Visualization","Propagation Behaviors"]}],"abstract":"Ultrasonic transducer, as a measurement technique, gains more and more attention in Non-Destructive Testing and Evaluation (NDT&E) and imaging applications.

Simulation result and analysis which fits the theoretical analysis are given in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429186/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13307727","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6429186/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel Allocation Based on Potential Game in Cognitive Radio System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Allocation Based on Potential Game in Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935b494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069961S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6429190,"authors":[{"name":"Siyu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"38547804500"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38238985300"},{"name":"Ran Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Tao","id":"37289461800"},{"name":"Lijuan Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Jia","id":"37591582600"},{"name":"Junxiu Lv","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junxiu","lastName":"Lv","id":"38548390000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5034-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6429190","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Chirp","Demodulation","Fourier transforms","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","error statistics","Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","signal detection","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FRFT-OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","fractional Fourier transform","peak-to-average power ratio","encrypted modulation parameter","PAPR","chirp signal energy collection","noncooperative receiver detection","signal demodulation","BER performance","zero-forcing equalization","secure communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","low interception","FRFT","PAPR","fractional order"]}],"abstract":"The traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FT-OFDM) signals are vulnerable to be detected and intercepted, which limit the application in secure communication. In this paper, we use the OFDM systems based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT-OFDM), then analyze their advantage of low detection and low interception through peak-to-average power ratio and encrypted modulation parameters. First, the PAPR of this system is lower than the counterpart of traditional OFDM systems by inhibiting PAPR in some fractional orders due to the difference of chirp signals' energy collect. So the symbol characteristics are not obvious, and the signals are difficult to be detected by non-cooperative receiver. Second, non-cooperative receiver is difficult to demodulate signals correctly for the demodulation is sensitive to different fractional orders. Finally, the BER performance of the system is about 1.5 dB lower than traditional OFDM systems after zero-forcing equalization under the same channel condition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Study on the Performance of Low Detection and Low Interception of FRFT-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2012.354","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6425312/6428840/06429190.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCCC.2012.354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428840","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Study on the Performance of Low Detection and Low Interception of FRFT-OFDM","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6429190/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13307731","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Study on the Performance of Low Detection and Low Interception of FRFT-OFDM","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"4935b513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085926S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6425312","isNumber":"6428840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6425312","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6428840","articleId":"6429190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6429219,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Han","affiliation":["Sci. & Technol. on Commun.

There are two areas of control system theory in which the application of performance measures is of interest: 1) the evaluation of control system designs in general, and 2) the design of adaptive control systems. In the former case, the performance measure is becoming an increasingly important aid to the control system designer. In the latter case, the performance measure takes on even greater significance, since adaptive systems include, by definition, a performance measure as an essential function which permits correction of system dynamic response during actual operation. Furthermore, the over-all evaluation of the adaptive loop itself presents new problems in the choice and use of performance criteria. In the past, emphasis has been placed on various types of integrals, such as integral of error-squared and integral of the product of time and absolute error (ITAE); present emphasis is being placed on forms of integrals of a more general type; the trend for future emphasis appears to be in applications of statistical concepts and in attacking the problem of choice of the error measure in the adaptive system.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1961.6429306","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/6429299/06429306.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"35","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1961.6429306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6429299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control system performance measures: Past, present, and future","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1961","displayDocTitle":"Control system performance measures: Past, present, and future","volume":"AC-6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control system performance measures: Past, present, and future","sourcePdf":"0022past.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036983S","chronDate":"Feb.  1961","isNumber":"6429299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"22","articleId":"6429306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6429319,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-199X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3651"}],"articleNumber":"6429319","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429319","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Polynomials","Educational institutions","Thermal stability","Modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.1961.6429319","endPage":"90","startPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/6429299/06429319.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1961.6429319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6429299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notes on the stability criterion for linear discrete systems","abstract":"It is known that linear time-invariant discrete systems can be described by constant coefficient linear difference equations.

This new algorithm makes possible the ray tracing of complex scenes by medium-scale and small-scale computers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space subdivision for fast ray tracing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/MCG.1984.6429331","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/6429323/06429331.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1984.6429331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6429323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Space subdivision for fast ray tracing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","accessionNumber":"2410382","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space subdivision for fast ray tracing","sourcePdf":"015024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017158S","chronDate":"Oct.  1984","isNumber":"6429323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"74","articleId":"6429331","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6429355,"authors":[{"name":"James D.

Such systems are described by linear difference equations with periodic coefficients; however, the difference equation which describes the system at sampling instants corresponding to KN, where N is the period of the coefficients of the difference equation, and K = 0, 1, 2, \u2026, is a linear difference equation with constant coefficients. Thus by forming a series of difference equations which individually describe the system at sampling instants corresponding to KN, KN+1, KN+2, \u2026, (K+1)N\u22121, the time varying features of the system are in essence removed from the analysis and the z-transform can be used to solve the resulting constant coefficient difference equations. Also, the response between the sampling instants can be found using the solutions of these difference equations. The method presented is straightforward and can be used to analyze any linear sampled-data system with a periodic sampling pattern. Such a condition could occur, for example, when a computer is time shared by more than one system or in some telemetering devices which periodically give to control systems information on quantities being monitored but in which the desired information is not available at equally spaced intervals of time. This method can also be used to obtain an approximate solution for the output of any linear system which is excited by a periodic but nonsinusoidal forcing function and, because of the flexibility of the sampling pattern, should give more accurate results than an approximation which uses equally spaced samples. In this analysis, only periodicity of the sampling pattern is assumed, and no relationship between the individual sampling intervals is required. A few examples have been introduced to illustrate the analytical procedure and the features of the response of a system to sinusoidal inputs is indicated in one of the examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/6429391/06429398.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1959.6429398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1959.6429398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6429391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6429398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The analysis of sampled-data control systems with a periodically time-varying sampling rate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Difference equations","Control systems","Time varying systems","Differential equations","IEEE transactions","Computers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1959","displayDocTitle":"The analysis of sampled-data control systems with a periodically time-varying sampling rate","volume":"AC-4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1959","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The analysis of sampled-data control systems with a periodically time-varying sampling rate","sourcePdf":"0015jury.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025975S","chronDate":"May  1959","isNumber":"6429391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6429398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6429401,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The form in which this expression is usually desired is that of a ratio of two frequency-dependent polynomials. In this paper, a method of evaluation of the polynomial coefficients is presented. It is based on the minimization of the weighted sum of the squares of the errors between the absolute magnitudes of the actual function and the polynomial ratio, taken at various values of frequency (the independent variable). The problem of the evaluation of the unknown coefficients is reduced to that of the numerical solution of certain determinants. The elements of these determinants are functions of the amplitude ratio and phase shift, taken at various values of frequency. This form of solution is particularly adaptable to digital computing methods, be-because of the simplicity in the required programming. The treatment is restricted to systems which have no poles on the imaginary axis; i.e., to systems having a finite, steady-state (zero frequency) magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.1959.6429401","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/8163/6429391/06429401.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1959.6429401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6429391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex-curve fitting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6429401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1959","displayDocTitle":"Complex-curve fitting","volume":"AC-4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1959","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex-curve fitting","sourcePdf":"0037levy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019349S","chronDate":"May  1959","isNumber":"6429391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8163","citationCount":"255","articleId":"6429401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"}]
