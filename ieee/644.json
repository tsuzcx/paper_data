The allocation problem is complicated by multiple competing objectives and by uncertainty in the outcome corresponding to a given allocation policy. These characteristics were taken into account by eliciting a multiattribute utility function from two directors to quantify their preferences for multidimensional uncertain outcomes. Independence conditions verified with the two directors permitted decomposition of this function into appropriately scaled sums and products of one-dimensional utility functions, and this greatly simplified th assessment task. The expectation of the multiattribute utility function was used as the objective function to be maximized in the analytical model developed. The directors' judgments concerning the relationships between the allocation variables and the outcomes were quantified by assessing subjective probability distributions at fixed values of the allocation variables.","doi":"10.1109/TEM.1978.6447269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.1978.6447269","startPage":"8","endPage":"14","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/6447265/06447269.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6447265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation planning for R & D with uncertainty and multiple objectives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Allocation planning for R & D with uncertainty and multiple objectives","publicationDate":"Feb. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","volume":"EM-25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"1170903","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6447269/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation planning for R & D with uncertainty and multiple objectives","sourcePdf":"008014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050351S","chronDate":"Feb.  1978","isNumber":"6447265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6447269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6447302,"authors":[{"name":"William E.

As part of this initial phase, begun in 1982, two surveys were conducted: 1) an open-ended survey of 158 new products in the electronics industry, followed by 2) a structured survey of 118 of the original products. Both surveys used a pairwise comparison methodology. Our research identified eight broad areas that appear to be important for new product success in a high-technology environment: 1) market knowledge gained through frequent and intense customer interaction, which leads to high benefit-to-cost products; 2) and 3) planning and coordination of the new product process, especially the R&D phase; 4) emphasis on marketing and sales; 5) management support for the product throughout the development and launch stages; 6) the contribution margin of the product; 7) early market entry; 8) proximity of the new product technologies and markets to the existing strengths of the developing unit. Based on these results, a preliminary model of the new product process is proposed in the concluding section. There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system.

Initially ignored, it is now considered the key to improving high-tech productivity. Most writers agree on a definition which identifies the start as a novel creative step, and the end as the time of commercial availability or general use. There appear to be two basic categories of technical innovation: the first stems from research or exploration, starts with some kind of breakthrough, and requires a long period to bring to market. The second is the result of a new planned effort and usually reaches the market in a fraction of the time required for a research innovation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6447615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"EM-32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","accessionNumber":"2629924","displayDocTitle":"Identifying technical innovations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying technical innovations","sourcePdf":"158176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030645S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"6447609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6447615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6447632,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph A.

Based on a review of literature pertaining to the R&D project selection, a survey framework was first generated. The data were collected from 73 laboratories of Korean private companies through a structured questionnaire, via a mail survey supplemented by some telephone interviews. As expected, the usage of formal models in R&D project selection are considerably limited in Korea. The findings, however, suggest that the formal models utilized by the research laboratories are varied distinctively according to research types. Exploratory and supportive R&D projects are selected by using screening models, while high-risk, new business development projects are selected by using evaluation models. For the selection of exploratory and supportive R&D projects, the major decision makers are laboratory directors, and the important decision criteria are technical factors. On the other hand, the major decision makers for the high-risk new business development projects come from the top management of firms, and they consider the market factors important as well as strategic factors. Several aspects of idea generation and collection for the R&D project selection are also presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Laboratories","Analytical models","Industries","Companies","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research and development management","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["R&D project selection","newly industrializing country","research and development management","Korea","review","structured questionnaire","mail survey","telephone interviews","screening models","development projects","evaluation models","decision makers","laboratory directors","high-risk new business development","market factors","strategic factors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEM.1986.6447662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/6447657/06447662.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6447657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.1986.6447662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"R&D project selection: Behavior and practice in a newly industrializing country","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6447662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"R&D project selection: Behavior and practice in a newly industrializing country","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6447662/","volume":"EM-33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"2784824","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R&D project selection: Behavior and practice in a newly industrializing country","sourcePdf":"141147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032534S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"6447657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6447662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6447666,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Khorramshahgol","affiliation":["School of Business, North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC 27707"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Khorramshahgol"},{"name":"Yvon Gousty","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Management, University of Law, Economics and Sciences, Aix-Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Gousty"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9391"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0040"}],"articleNumber":"6447666","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Technology Management Council","url":"http://www.ieee.org/tmc"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6447666","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Resource management","Portfolios","Mathematical model","Organizations","Object recognition","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research and development management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective cost/benefit approach","R&D portfolio analysis","research and development","Delphic Goal Programming","Delphi inquiry","projects"]}],"abstract":"A systematic way for allocating resources among different research and development (R&D) projects in a multiple objective environment is developed.

Successive rounds of Delphi are then utilized to prioritize these objectives, and to determine the relative weight and the aspiration level for each objective. Finally, through Delphi inquiry, a portfolio of R&D projects to achieve these objectives is identified. The results of the Delphi inquiry are used to build a goal programming model.

It has been suggested that sociocultural differences between them in terms of their orientation towards time, types of projects they prefer to work on, their tolerance for ambiguity, and their professional and bureaucratic orientations can significantly contribute to the quality of the vital interface. The findings of this study of R and D and marketing managers in high-tech companies contradict the generally held beliefs that these managers are socioculturally different and that their orientations affect the integration process. In fact, more similarities than differences were found. It is therefore proposed that the R and D marketing integration problem may not be simple `people' problem. Its solution may depend as much on organization design variables.","doi":"10.1109/TEM.1986.6447719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.1986.6447719","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/6447712/06447719.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6447712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"R&d and marketing managers in high-tech companies: Are they different?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","displayDocTitle":"R&d and marketing managers in high-tech companies: Are they different?","publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","volume":"EM-33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"2689831","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6447719/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R&d and marketing managers in high-tech companies: Are they different?","sourcePdf":"025032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040531S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"6447712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6447719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6448029,"authors":[{"name":"John Voelcker","firstName":"John","lastName":"Voelcker"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"6448029","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6448029","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard discs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Winchester disks","gigabyte","hard disks","small-system designs","disk drives","higher data transfer rate","head positioning","disk drive arrays","5.25 inches","1 GB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.1987.6448029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/6373568/06448029.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1987.6448029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Winchester disks reach for a gigabyte: Poised for a 200-fold increase in capacity over initial models of six years ago, 5 1/4-inch hard disks are emerging as major elements for small-system designs","abstract":"Poised for a 200-fold increase in capacity over initial models of six years ago, 5 1/4 inch hard disks are emerging as major elements for small-system designs.

These literature indicators must be used very carefully in evaluation. For example, since they are statistical indicators, they are more valid when applied to groups of researchers than to an individual researcher. This paper illustrates the use of quantitative indicators in the evaluation of actual projects/programs of federal agencies that support basic research. It also contains `field norm' tables that describe a number of statistical characteristics of randomly selected academic researchers working in six different R&D areas. These tables enable the R&D manager to compare his staff and its publication performance with a baseline measure of academic research performance.","doi":"10.1109/TEM.1983.6448601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6448597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.1983.6448601","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/17/6448597/06448601.pdf","startPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative indicators for evaluation of basic research programs/projects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6448601/","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative indicators for evaluation of basic research programs/projects","volume":"EM-30","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"2123644","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative indicators for evaluation of basic research programs/projects","sourcePdf":"106112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016628S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"6448597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6448601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6448622,"authors":[{"name":"Paul R.

The wireless node needs to send the data out in a timely and energy efficient way. This transmission control problem is challenging in that we need to jointly consider perceived video quality, quality variation, power consumption and transmission delay requirements, and the wireless channel uncertainty. We address the above issues by first building a rate-distortion model for compressive sensing video. Then we formulate the deterministic and stochastic optimization problems and design the transmission control algorithm which jointly performs rate control, scheduling and power control. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed transmission control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.012313.121150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6482467/06449247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.012313.121150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482467","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Control for Compressive Sensing Video over Wireless Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Control for Compressive Sensing Video over Wireless Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449247/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398233","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449247/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Control for Compressive Sensing Video over Wireless Channel","sourcePdf":"1429-tw1303-xiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099616S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449247","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449248,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Keong Ho","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6507664/6449248/6449248-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin Keong Ho received the B.

Our contributions are in designing an optimal preamble, and the corresponding estimator, to closely achieve the minimum Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the CFO. This optimality is asserted with respect to a novel class of preambles, referred to as block-rotated preambles (BRPs). This class includes the periodic preamble that is used widely in practice, yet this class provides an additional degree of design freedom via a block rotation angle. We first identify the catastrophic scenario of an arbitrarily large CRB when a conventional periodic preamble is used. We next resolve this problem by using a BRP with a non-zero block rotation angle. This angle creates, in effect, an artificial frequency offset that separates the desired relayed signal from the self-interference that is introduced in the AF protocol. With appropriate optimization, the CRB incurs only marginal loss from one-way relaying under practical channel conditions. To facilitate implementation, a specific low-complexity class of estimators is examined, and conditions for the estimators to achieve the optimized CRB are established. Numerical results corroborate with theoretical findings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Relays","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Vectors","Baseband","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset estimation","two-way relaying","optimal preamble design","estimator design","amplify-and-forward protocol","Cramer-Rao bound","block-rotated preambles","BRP","nonzero block rotation angle","artificial frequency offset","marginal loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency offset estimation","two-way relaying","preamble design","Cramer-Rao bound"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.121208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6507664/06449248.pdf","startPage":"1898","endPage":"1909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.121208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Two-Way Relaying: Optimal Preamble and Estimator Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Two-Way Relaying: Optimal Preamble and Estimator Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449248/","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449248/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13475871","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Two-Way Relaying: Optimal Preamble and Estimator Design","sourcePdf":"1898-tw1304-ho.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068813S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6449248","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6449249,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Stamatiou","affiliation":["CTTC, Castelldefels, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449249/6449249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kostas Stamatiou (M'09) received his Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens in 2000, and the MSc and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2004 and 2009, respectively, from the University of California San Diego.

The analysis is based on the assumptions that the transmitters are spatially distributed according to a Poisson point process, and that the channel follows a Rayleigh fading distribution, with a mean that is determined by spreading loss and frequency-dependent absorption. We evaluate the probability of a successful transmission, i.e., the probability that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at the typical receiver is greater than a given threshold, and determine the maximum network throughput density over the transmitter density and the operating frequency. The theoretical results are validated using a realistic underwater channel simulator based on ray tracing. It is demonstrated that, for a number of practical scenarios, the theoretical and simulated throughput match provided that the spreading-loss exponent is appropriately fitted to the simulation scenario. Overall, the proposed framework provides easy-to-obtain network throughput results, which can be used as a complement or an alternative to time-costly, deployment-dependent network simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6482467/06449249.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.012513.120234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.012513.120234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Throughput of Underwater Networks: Analysis and Validation using a Ray Tracing Simulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Absorption","Fading","Wireless communication","Ray tracing","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","ray tracing","Rayleigh channels","stochastic processes","underwater acoustic communication","underwater acoustic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater network throughput","ray tracing simulator","node topology","propagation environments","Poisson point process","Rayleigh fading distribution channel","frequency-dependent absorption","successful transmission probability","signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio","receiver","transmitter density","realistic underwater channel simulator","spreading-loss exponent","deployment-dependent network simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater networks","throughput","transmission capacity","Poisson point process","Urick model","ray tracing","Bellhop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"The Throughput of Underwater Networks: Analysis and Validation using a Ray Tracing Simulator","volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6449249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398234","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Throughput of Underwater Networks: Analysis and Validation using a Ray Tracing Simulator","sourcePdf":"1108-tw1303-kostas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090222S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449249","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449251,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Cvetkovic","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Kings College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449251/6449251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zoran Cvetkovi \u0107 received the Dipl.Ing.El. and Mag.El. degrees from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1989 and 1992, respectively, the M.Phil. degree from Columbia University, New York, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1995.

In this paper we consider the achievable accuracy of PU localization algorithms that jointly utilize received-signal-strength (RSS) and direction-of-arrival (DoA) measurements by evaluating the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB). Previous works evaluate the CRB for RSS-only and DoA-only localization algorithms separately and assume DoA estimation error variance is a fixed constant or rather independent of RSS. We derive the CRB for joint RSS/DoA-based PU localization algorithms based on the mathematical model of DoA estimation error variance as a function of RSS, for a given CR placement. The bound is compared with practical localization algorithms and the impact of several key parameters, such as number of nodes, number of antennas and samples, channel shadowing variance and correlation distance, on the achievable accuracy are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. We also derive the closed-form asymptotic CRB for uniform random CR placement, and perform theoretical and numerical studies on the required number of CRs such that the asymptotic CRB tightly approximates the numerical integration of the CRB for a given placement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13398236","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449252/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cramer-Rao Bounds for Joint RSS/DoA-Based Primary-User Localization in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer-Rao Bounds for Joint RSS/DoA-Based Primary-User Localization in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1363-tw1303-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069697S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449252","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449253,"authors":[{"name":"Gubong Lim","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449253/6449253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gubong Lim (S'09) received the B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2003 from Gangneung National University, Gangneung, Korea, and the M.S. degree from the University of Delaware, Newark, DE, in 2005.

Various strategies for improving the energy efficiency, which is defined as the transmitted bits per total energy consumed (in bits/Joule), have been proposed. In this paper, we analyze the energy efficiency of clustered cooperative beamforming where distributed relay nodes construct a virtual Multiple-Input Single-Output beamforming system with a maximum transmit power constraint, and compare its performance with that of direct communications. All the energy consumption overheads incurred are taken into account in the energy efficiency analysis assuming a constant circuit-power consumption model. We then study the number of relay nodes that maximizes the efficiency for a given outage constraint. In addition, we propose a mode switching algorithm which optimally chooses between using cooperative beamforming or direct communications for transmission. We show that cooperative beamforming significantly outperforms direct communications in energy efficiency, as well as in spectral efficiency, even though a much larger amount of circuit power is consumed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13398204","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449253/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient cooperative beamforming in clustered wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient cooperative beamforming in clustered wireless networks","sourcePdf":"1376-tw1303-lim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063652S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449253","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449254,"authors":[{"name":"Sungsoo Park","affiliation":["Information Telecommunication Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449254/6449254-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungsoo Park (S'07, M'12) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

The goal of this paper is to determine an optimal spectrum sensing policy that maximizes the expected total throughput subject to an energy causality constraint and a collision constraint. The energy causality constraint comes from the fact that the total consumed energy should be equal to or less than the total harvested energy, while the collision constraint is required to protect the primary user. We first show that the system can be divided into a spectrum-limited regime and an energy-limited regime depending on where the detection threshold for the spectrum sensor lies. Assuming infinite battery capacity, we derive the optimal detection threshold that maximizes the expected total throughput subject to the energy causality constraint and the collision constraint. Analytical and numerical results show that the system is energy-limited if the energy arrival rate is lower than the expected energy consumption for a single spectrum access. They also show that a decreasing probability of accessing the occupied spectrum does not always result in decreased probability of accessing the idle spectrum in the energy-limited regime.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.012413.121009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.012413.121009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6482467/06449254.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","volume":"12","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449254/","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398237","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"1386-tw1303-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138175S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449254","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6449255,"authors":[{"name":"Junling Mao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6521481/6449255/6449255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junling Mao received the B.E. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008.

The energy-efficient power allocation problem of OFDM-based CR systems is studied under the total power constraint, the interference power constraint and the rate constraint. Since the energy-efficient power allocation problem is non-convex, in order to find the optimal power allocation at each subcarrier, we propose a novel method named water-filling factors aided search (WFAS) to solve the EE optimization problems with multiple constraints. The global \u03b5-optimality and the convergence of the proposed method are presented. The numerical results confirm the theoretical conclusions. The comparisons of the energy-efficient power allocation and the spectrum-efficient power allocation in OFDM-based CR systems are given under different constraints via numerical simulations as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6521481/06449255.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.121013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.121013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: A Water-Filling Factor Aided Search Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Resource management","Interference","Wireless communication","Complexity theory","Throughput","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","energy conservation","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency optimization","OFDM-based cognitive radio system","water-filling factor aided search method","CR system","wireless systems","unit-energy consumption","energy-efficient power allocation problem","interference power constraint","optimal power allocation","WFAS","EE optimization problem","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Cognitive radio","OFDM","Power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: A Water-Filling Factor Aided Search Method","volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6449255/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13529362","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems: A Water-Filling Factor Aided Search Method","sourcePdf":"2366-tw1305-mao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084571S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6521481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6521481","articleId":"6449255","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449257,"authors":[{"name":"Franeois Quitin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449257/6449257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fran\u00e7ois Quitin received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium and from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium in 2011.

Distributed beamforming is a cooperative transmission technique that can achieve orders of magnitude increases in range or energy efficiency of wireless communication systems. However, this technique requires precise synchronization of the radio frequency signal from each transmitter. The significance of our prototype is in demonstrating that this requirement can be satisfied using digital signal processing methods on commodity hardware with low-quality oscillators. Our synchronization approach scales to large numbers of transmitters: each transmitter runs independent algorithms based on periodically transmitted feedback packets from the receiver. A key simplification is the decoupling of the algorithms for frequency locking and beamsteering at each transmitter, even though both processes use the same feedback packets. Frequency locking employs an Extended Kalman filter to track the local oscillator offset between a transmitter and the receiver, using frequency offset measurements based on the feedback packet waveform, while the phase adjustments for beamsteering are determined using a one-bit feedback algorithm based on the feedback packet it payload. Our prototype demonstrates that distributed transmit beamforming can be incorporated into wireless networks without requiring hardware innovations, and provides open-source building blocks for future research and development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13398239","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449257/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Architecture for Distributed Transmit Beamforming with Commodity Radios: Design and Proof of Concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Architecture for Distributed Transmit Beamforming with Commodity Radios: Design and Proof of Concept","sourcePdf":"1418-tw1303-quitin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08477S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449257","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449258,"authors":[{"name":"Sokchenda Sreng","affiliation":["IRIT Laboratory, School of ENSEEIHT, Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, University of Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449258/6449258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["sokchenda sreng received the Engineer degree in Electrical Engineering from Institut de Technologie du Cambodge, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2004, his M.Sc. degree in 2005, and his Ph.D. degree in 2012, both in Telecommunications and Networking from Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.

In particular, we focus on the case of mobile relays that forward the satellite signal to a masked mobile destination node. The Selective Decode-and-Forward (SDF) transmission scheme is implemented and only the relay nodes which can successfully decode the satellite message are selected to retransmit the signal. The destination node exploits the spatial diversity advantages by implementing a typical Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) technique. The closed-form expressions for the exact average SEP of the arbitrary M-ary phase shift keying and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signaling with MRC diversity reception over independent but not necessarily identically distributed fading channels are derived using a Moment Generating Function (MGF) approach. These closed-form expressions are represented in terms of a finite sum of Lauricella hypergeometric functions. The analytical expressions show excellent agreement with the simulation results. Numerical results show that for a system using QPSK under the frequent heavy shadowed fading condition, the diversity gain of approximately 7 dB can be obtained at the SEP of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n with respect to the direct transmission, when only one relay is used.

We use the resulting formulations to characterize the performance of different combinations of resource allocation schemes and transmission coordination mechanisms. We obtained important engineering insights regarding the interplay of these network processes. In particular, under the deployment of pico base stations, we find that partially shared deployment outperforms the co-channel deployment, with or without transmission coordination.

It is shown that large TOA errors are incurred if the transmitter and receiver clocks are mistuned by more than just one part per million (ppm). This represents a serious obstacle to the use of commercial low-cost quartz oscillators, as they exhibit frequency drifts in the range of \u00b110 ppm and more. A solution is to estimate first the transmitter clock frequency relative to the receiver's and then compensate for the difference by acting on the receiver clock tuning. An algorithm is proposed that estimates the transmitter clock frequency with an accuracy better than 0.1 ppm. Computer simulations indicate that its use in ranging systems makes TOA measurements as good as those obtained with perfectly synchronous clocks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.120319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6507664/06449260.pdf","endPage":"1616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Wideband TOA Estimation in the Presence of Clock Frequency Offset","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.120319","startPage":"1606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Wideband TOA Estimation in the Presence of Clock Frequency Offset","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449260/","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13475873","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449260/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Wideband TOA Estimation in the Presence of Clock Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"1606-tw1304-damico.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081874S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6449260","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449262,"authors":[{"name":"Meixia Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449262/6449262-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Meixia Tao (S'00-M'04-SM'10) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2003.

The adaption involves transmission mode selection (a user can choose from direct or cooperative transmission), subcarrier assignment, subcarrier pairing (the incoming and outgoing subcarriers at the relay for cooperative transmission need to be matched), relay selection, as well as power allocation and hence is highly challenging. Many previous works only consider a subset of the adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the joint optimization problem using a network flow approach. Specifically, we first show that for given power allocation, the combinatorial optimization problem of transmission mode selection, subcarrier assignment, relay selection and subcarrier pairing for the system total throughput maximization can be transformed into a minimum cost network flow (MCNF) problem with integer solutions. The linear optimal distribution (LOD) algorithm is applied to find the optimal solution in polynomial time. We then solve the mixed integer programming problem of the joint assignment and power allocation in an asymptotically optimal way in the dual domain. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the overall system throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network Flow Approach to Throughput Maximization in Cooperative OFDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.012413.120403","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6482467/06449262.pdf","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.012413.120403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6482467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Network Flow Approach to Throughput Maximization in Cooperative OFDMA Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6449262/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398242","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network Flow Approach to Throughput Maximization in Cooperative OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"1138-tw1303-tao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082072S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449262","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449265,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449265/6449265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shun Zhang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Shangdong University, Jinan, China, in 2007.

Interference mitigation techniques relying on multiple antennas and coordination among cells are nowadays heavily studied in the literature. Typical strategies in OFDMA networks include coordinated scheduling, beamforming and power control. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical type of coordination for OFDMA downlink networks relying on multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. The transmission ranks, i.e. the number of transmitted streams, and the user scheduling in all cells are jointly optimized in order to maximize a network utility function accounting for fairness among users. A distributed coordinated scheduler motivated by an interference pricing mechanism and relying on a masterslave architecture is introduced. The proposed scheme is operated based on the user report of a recommended rank for the interfering cells accounting for the receiver interference suppression capability. It incurs a very low feedback and backhaul overhead and enables efficient link adaptation. It is moreover robust to channel measurement errors and applicable to both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO operations. A 20% cell edge performance gain over uncoordinated LTE-A system is shown through system level simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6507664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6507664/06449266.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.112100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.013013.112100","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Cooperative Multicell MIMO-OFDMA Network Based on Rank Coordination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449266/","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Cooperative Multicell MIMO-OFDMA Network Based on Rank Coordination","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449266/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13475876","dateOfInsertion":"29 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Cooperative Multicell MIMO-OFDMA Network Based on Rank Coordination","sourcePdf":"1481-tw1304-bruno.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087853S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6507664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6507664","articleId":"6449266","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449267,"authors":[{"name":"Santhosh Kumar","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Texas A&M Univ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6482467/6449267/6449267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Santhosh Kumar is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Texas A&M University, College Station, TX.

Specifically, we consider the problem of channel capture by a secondary network that uses spectrum sensing to determine the availability of the channel, and its impact on the primary throughput. We integrate the notion of transmission slots in Bianchi's Markov model with the physical time slots, to derive the transmission probability of the secondary network as a function of its scan duration. This is used to obtain analytical expressions for the throughput achievable by the primary and secondary networks. Our analysis considers both saturated and unsaturated networks. By performing a numerical search, the secondary network parameters are selected to maximize its throughput for a given level of protection of the primary network throughput. The theoretical expressions are validated using extensive simulations carried out in the Network Simulator 2. Our results provide critical insights into the performance and robustness of different schemes for medium access by the secondary network. In particular, we find that the channel captures by the secondary network does not significantly impact the primary throughput, and that simply increasing the secondary contention window size is only marginally inferior to silent-period based methods in terms of its throughput performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398245","htmlLink":"/document/6449267/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Primary and Secondary Networks in a Shared IEEE 802.11 System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis of Primary and Secondary Networks in a Shared IEEE 802.11 System","sourcePdf":"1006-tw1303-kumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165812S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6482467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6482467","articleId":"6449267","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449268,"authors":[{"name":"Muntasir Raihan Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4275028/6522803/6449268/6449268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muntasir Raihan Rahman received his B.

A major challenge in this respect is the VN embedding problem that deals with the efficient mapping of virtual resources on InP network resources. Previous research focused on heuristic algorithms for the VN embedding problem assuming that the InP network remains operational at all times. In this paper, we remove this assumption by formulating the survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE) problem. We then develop a pro-active, and a hybrid policy heuristic to solve it, and a baseline policy heuristic to compare to. The hybrid policy is based on a fast re-routing strategy and utilizes a pre-reserved quota for backup on each physical link. Our evaluation results show that our proposed heuristics for SVNE outperform the baseline heuristic in terms of long term business profit for the InP, acceptance ratio, bandwidth efficiency, and response time.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2013.013013.110202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/6522803/06449268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2013.013013.110202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6522803","startPage":"105","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVNE: Survivable Virtual Network Embedding Algorithms for Network Virtualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SVNE: Survivable Virtual Network Embedding Algorithms for Network Virtualization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13538607","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449268/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVNE: Survivable Virtual Network Embedding Algorithms for Network Virtualization","sourcePdf":"105-tnsm1306-muntasir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136096S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6522803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"6522803","articleId":"6449268","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449270,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy A.

Compressive sensing (CS) theory suggests a new way of sensing the signal with a much lower number of linear measurements as compared to the conventional case provided that the underlying signal is sparse. This result has implications on WSN energy efficiency and prolonging network lifetime. In this paper, the effects of acquiring, processing, and communicating CS-based measurements on WSN lifetime are analyzed in comparison to conventional approaches. Energy dissipation models for both CS and conventional approaches are built and used to construct a mixed integer programming framework that jointly captures the energy costs for computation and communication for both CS and conventional approaches. Numerical analysis is performed by systematically sampling the parameter space (i.e., sparsity levels, network radius, and number of nodes). Our results show that CS prolongs network lifetime for sparse signals and is more advantageous for WSNs with a smaller coverage area.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2244036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2244036","startPage":"1999","endPage":"2008","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6486560/06449277.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6486560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13427874","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449277/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Energy Efficiency of Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-tavli-2244036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13267S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6486560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6486560","articleId":"6449277","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6449280,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Nan Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Nan","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37348346100"},{"name":"Wen-Yi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38569383600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6449280","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2492},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Resonant frequency","Dual band","Current distribution","Band pass filters","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","frequency selective surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closely located resonance","dual-frequency miniaturized periodic element","dual-band frequency selective surface","closely spaced band","complementary structure","dual-bandpass FSS","dual-bandstop FSS","two element resonance stability","polarizations angle","incidence angle","full-wave simulation","free-space wavelength","resonant frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-band spatial filter","frequency selective surface (FSS)","miniaturized periodic element"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel dual-frequency miniaturized periodic element for creating a dual-band frequency selective surface (FSS) having closely spaced bands of operation.

The Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined data offloading as a critical area to cope with this problem. Local IP access (LIPA) and selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO) are considered to be the typical technologies to implement cellular data offloading. Currently, device-to-device (D2D) communication has been proposed as a new dataoffloading solution. The D2D communication underlying a cellular infrastructure reduces the radio access network load as well as the core network load. The cellular network needs to establish a new type of radio bearer for D2D communications, and this bearer can provide the direct traffic path between devices. In this article, we propose a D2D bearer control architecture for D2D communications supported by a longterm evolution-advanced (LTE-A) infrastructure. This could be a feasible and efficient solution for offloading data from the cellular network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13565774","publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449283/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Solving the data overload: Device-to-device bearer control architecture for cellular data offloading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving the data overload: Device-to-device bearer control architecture for cellular data offloading","sourcePdf":"08mvt01-yang-2234052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046122S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10209","isNumber":"6470735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10209","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6470735","articleId":"6449283","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"\u00a9PHOTO F/X2\u00a9PHOTODISCIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6449287,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Recent developments in single flux quantum circuit technology for digital logic include variants with greatly improved energy efficiency. Concepts were investigated for computing systems capable of performance in the range from 1 to 1000 PFLOP/s. The concept systems were constrained to use existing commercial cryogenic refrigerators and Nb superconducting technology. In order to meet the performance goals, cache and main memory capable of operating at cryogenic temperatures will be required.

Furthermore, reset current is found to decrease with reducing nanopillar transistor design diameter, which is beneficial for circuit power consumption consideration.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2240389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6466448/06449307.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2240389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6466448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully CMOS-Compatible 1T1R Integration of Vertical Nanopillar GAA Transistor and Oxide-Based RRAM Cell for High-Density Nonvolatile Memory Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","displayDocTitle":"Fully CMOS-Compatible 1T1R Integration of Vertical Nanopillar GAA Transistor and Oxide-Based RRAM Cell for High-Density Nonvolatile Memory Application","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449307/","accessionNumber":"13325950","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully CMOS-Compatible 1T1R Integration of Vertical Nanopillar GAA Transistor and Oxide-Based RRAM Cell for High-Density Nonvolatile Memory Application","sourcePdf":"ted-fang-2240389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107375S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6466448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6466448","articleId":"6449307","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449310,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6449310/6449310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhou received the Ph.D. degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China, in 2012.","In August 2012, he joined the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."]},"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37400757400"},{"name":"Wanjun Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6449310/6449310-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wanjun Chen received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2007.","In March 2008, he joined UESTC, where he is currently an Associate Professor."]},"firstName":"Wanjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404839200"},{"name":"Shenghou Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6466448/6449310/6449310-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Shenghou Liu was born in Henan, China, in 1984.

A new method, called MOOLP (multi-objective uncertain optimization with ordinal optimization (OO)), Latin supercube sampling and parallel computation), is proposed in this paper for dealing with the CBSOP. This proposed method consists of a constraint satisfaction phase and an objective optimization phase. In its constraint satisfaction phase, by using the OO technique, an adequate number of samples are allocated to promising solutions, and the number of unnecessary MC simulations for noncritical solutions can be reduced. This can achieve more than five times speed enhancement compared to the application of using an equal number of samples for each candidate solution. In its MOEA/D-based objective optimization phase, by using LSS, more than five times speed enhancement can be achieved with the same estimation accuracy compared to primitive MC simulation. Parallel computation is also used for speedup. A real-world problem of the bi-objective variation-aware sizing for an analog integrated circuit is used in this paper as a practical application. The experiments clearly demonstrate the advantages of MOOLP.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2244898","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6675095/06449314.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"796","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2244898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance-Constrained Bi-Objective Stochastic Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance-Constrained Bi-Objective Stochastic Optimization","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13934001","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449314/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance-Constrained Bi-Objective Stochastic Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-liu-2244898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113167S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6675095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6675095","articleId":"6449314","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6449316,"authors":[{"name":"Yongping Pan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yongping","lastName":"Pan","id":"38063351100"},{"name":"Meng Joo Er","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Joo","lastName":"Er","id":"37271404600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"6449316","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":717},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449316","abstract":"In this paper, an enhanced adaptive fuzzy control (AFC) strategy with guaranteed convergence of an optimal fuzzy approximation error (FAE) is presented for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in the general Brunovsky form. Based on the fuzzy logic system (FLS) with variable universes of discourse, relaxed sufficient conditions that guarantee the optimal FAE being convergent are given, and the upper bound of the optimal FAE is obtained. The control singularity problem resulting from the unknown affine term is resolved by a novel fuzzy approximation equation, and the parameter adaptive law of the FLS is derived by the Lyapunov synthesis. By means of the optimal FAE bound result, it is proved that the closed-loop system achieves partially asymptotic stability under a certain selection of control parameters. The proposed approach retains all advantages of a previous similar approach under relaxed constraint conditions. Thus, it provides a more flexible solution to the AFC with optimal FAE convergence.

Furthermore, it makes use of the multichannel data of remotely sensed images to achieve spectral coherence for the reconstruction result. To optimize the proposed variation model, a Bregmanized-operator-splitting algorithm is employed. The proposed inpainting algorithm was tested on simulated and real images.

DyS dynamically selects informative data to train the MLP. In order to evaluate DyS and understand its strength and weakness, comprehensive experimental studies have been carried out. Results on 20 multiclass imbalanced data sets show that DyS can outperform the compared methods, including pre-sample methods, active learning methods, cost-sensitive methods, and boosting-type methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2228231","startPage":"647","endPage":"660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6462010/06449324.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2228231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6462010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Sampling Approach to Training Neural Networks for Multiclass Imbalance Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Boosting","Heuristic algorithms","Sampling methods","Training data","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network training","multiclass imbalance classification","class imbalance supervised learning problems","dynamic sampling method","DyS","multilayer perceptrons","training process epoch","MLP training selection probability estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cost-sensitive learning","dynamic sampling","multiclass imbalance learning","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Sampling Approach to Training Neural Networks for Multiclass Imbalance Classification","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6449324/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13324047","pubMedId":"24808384","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Sampling Approach to Training Neural Networks for Multiclass Imbalance Classification","sourcePdf":"tnnls-tang-2228231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098225S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6462010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6462010","articleId":"6449324","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449326,"authors":[{"name":"Wuhua Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6513254/6449326/6449326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wuhua Li (M\u201909) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in applied power electronics and electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","From September 2004 to March 2005, he was an Intern, and from January 2007 to June 2008, a Research Assistant in GE Global Research Center, Shanghai, China.

Zero-voltage-switching performance is achieved for both the primary- and secondary-side power devices in a wide load range to reduce the switching losses due to the secondary-side phase-shift control scheme. Furthermore, compared with the conventional phase-shift control mechanism, the circulating current at the freewheeling stage is effectively suppressed as well to minimize the conduction losses. Moreover, the voltage stress of the primary switches is only half of the input voltage by employing the improved three-level structure, which makes the low-voltage rated power devices available to improve the circuit performance. In addition, the converter can work in the buck, balance, and boost modes to achieve a relatively wide input voltage range, which is an expected advantage for the communication power system to minimize the electrolytic capacitors with an acceptable hold-up time. The operation principle is analyzed and experimental results of a 1-kW 100-kHz prototype are provided to verify the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed converter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2242490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6513254/06449326.pdf","startPage":"5128","endPage":"5139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2242490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary-Side Phase-Shift-Controlled ZVS DC/DC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain for High Input Voltage Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secondary-Side Phase-Shift-Controlled ZVS DC/DC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain for High Input Voltage Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","volume":"28","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449326/","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13487523","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary-Side Phase-Shift-Controlled ZVS DC/DC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain for High Input Voltage Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2242490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077182S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6513254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6513254","articleId":"6449326","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6449328,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Kumar Meher","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6716075/6449328/6449328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pramod Kumar Meher (SM'03) is currently a Senior Scientist with the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore.

For achieving lower adaptation-delay and area-delay-power efficient implementation, we use a novel partial product generator and propose a strategy for optimized balanced pipelining across the time-consuming combinational blocks of the structure. From synthesis results, we find that the proposed design offers nearly 17% less area-delay product (ADP) and nearly 14% less energy-delay product (EDP) than the best of the existing systolic structures, on average, for filter lengths N=8, 16, and 32. We propose an efficient fixed-point implementation scheme of the proposed architecture, and derive the expression for steady-state error. We show that the steady-state mean squared error obtained from the analytical result matches with the simulation result. Moreover, we have proposed a bit-level pruning of the proposed architecture, which provides nearly 20% saving in ADP and 9% saving in EDP over the proposed structure before pruning without noticeable degradation of steady-state-error performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 February 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","volume":"22","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14056668","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6449328/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Area-Delay-Power Efficient Fixed-Point LMS Adaptive Filter With Low Adaptation-Delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-Delay-Power Efficient Fixed-Point LMS Adaptive Filter With Low Adaptation-Delay","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-park-2239321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085132S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6716075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6716075","articleId":"6449328","onlineDate":"04 February 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6449332,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Chen","affiliation":["Guodian Nanjing Automation Company Limited, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6484160/6449332/6449332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Chen received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K., in 2012.","Currently, he is with Guodian Nanjing Automation Co.

He was the lead designer of the first prototype for eight generations of Hitachi DRAMs, ranging from 4 Kb to 64 Mb. In the course of this development work, he invented in 1974 the concept of the folded data line (i.e., bit line) arrangement, which uses a pair of balanced data lines to eliminate various noise components, and presented the architecture for a 64-Kb DRAM at ISSCC 1980. From that time until the mid-2000s, this architecture was adopted for nearly all DRAM chips produced. He went on to develop high-density DRAM devices and LPLV DRAM circuits and array architectures. These have included triple-well substrate structures, advanced three-dimensional capacitors, pipelined DRAMs, on-chip substrate-bias generators, half-VDD sensing, on-chip voltage down-converters enabling the aging (burn-in) stress test, the PMOS word driver, the so-called direct sensing, multidivided data-line architectures, transposed data lines, the LV charge pump, and stress-voltage-tolerated I/O circuits. In addition, as early as 1988 he and his group initiated circuit inventions and developments that reduced the subthreshold current of MOSFETs even for the active mode.","He holds more than 460 patents in Japan and the United States.

However, cloud computing also presents many challenges, one of which is the difficulty in allowing users to freely obtain desired services, such as heterogeneous OSes and applications, via different light-weight devices. We have proposed a new paradigm by spatio-temporally extending the von Neumann architecture, called transparent computing, to centrally store and manage the commodity programs including OS codes, while streaming them to be run in non-state clients. This leads to a service-centric computing environment, in which users can select the desired services on demand, without concern for these services' administration, such as their installation, maintenance, management, and upgrade. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, namely Meta OS, to support such program streaming through a distributed 4VP\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n platform.

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6449400/06449406.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","doi":"10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing-based forensic analysis for collaborative network security management system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing-based forensic analysis for collaborative network security management system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449406/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","volume":"18","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cloud computing-based forensic analysis for collaborative network security management system","sourcePdf":"4050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091144S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6449400","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6449406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449408,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Qian","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Qian"},{"name":"Weilong Lei","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Weilong","lastName":"Lei"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6449408","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"abstract":"This paper describes an efficient implementation of the Sum-Product Algorithm (SPA) within a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code decoder, where a horizontal process correction term is used to improve the decoding performance of the Min-Sum algorithms.

However, in past work, word classes for CRNNLM were simply obtained based on the frequencies of words, which is not accurate. Hence, we take a closer look at the classing and to find out whether improved classing would translate to improve performance. More specially, we explore the use of the brown algorithm, which is a classical method of word classing.

In this paper, we proposed a privacy-preserving cloud-aware scenario for compressive multimedia applications, including multimedia compression, adaptation, editing/manipulation, enhancement, retrieval, and recognition. In the proposed framework, we investigate the applicability of our/existing compressive sensing (CS)-based multimedia compression and securely compressive multimedia \u201ctrans-sensing\u201d techniques based on sparse coding for securely delivering compressively sensed multimedia data over a cloud-aware scenario. Moreover, we also investigate the applicability of our/existing sparse coding-based frameworks for several multimedia applications by leveraging the strong capability of a media cloud. More specifically, to consider several fundamental challenges for multimedia cloud computing, such as security and network/device heterogeneities, we investigate the applications of CS and sparse coding techniques in multimedia delivery and applications. As a result, we can build a unified cloud-aware framework for privacy-preserving multimedia applications via sparse coding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290204","htmlLink":"/document/6449752/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving multimedia cloud computing via compressive sensing and sparse representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving multimedia cloud computing via compressive sensing and sparse representation","confLoc":"Yunlin, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"H6C15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067596S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409518","isNumber":"6449669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409518","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6449669","articleId":"6449752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449765,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Peng","affiliation":["Audiovisual Education Center, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Lingling","lastName":"Peng","id":"38548747100"},{"name":"Qiong Kang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37861429800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2588-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2587-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6449765","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Databases","Support vector machine classification","Face","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principle vectors subspace","principle component analysis","PCA","dimensionality reduction","feature extraction","nearest neighbor classifier","ORL database","AR database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Principle component analysis","face recognition","principle vector"]}],"abstract":"Principle component analysis (PCA) and its improved models have found wide applications in pattern recognition field. PCA is a common method applied to dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Its goal is to choose a set of projection directions to represent original data with the minimum MSE. In this paper, we propose a Principle Vectors Subspace (PVS) for face recognition. Firstly, we use PCA to extract each dimension vector, so we attain a subspace which conclude principle vectors of each dimension. Then we use a base of this subspace to represent a test sample and classify it by Nearest Neighbor classifier. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we make a comparison of PCA, KPCA and our method on the ORL and AR databases. The experimental results show our method take a good performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.2012.6449765","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Information Security and Intelligent Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Information Security and Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409518/6449669/06449765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.2012.6449765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449669","startPage":"298","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition by Principle Vectors Subspace","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition by Principle Vectors Subspace","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13290217","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6449765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition by Principle Vectors Subspace","confLoc":"Yunlin, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"K1C36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078468S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6409518","isNumber":"6449669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6409518","xplore-issue":"6449669","articleId":"6449765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6449770,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication, Shu-Te University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293076100"},{"name":"Li-Peng Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Peng","lastName":"Yin","id":"37400088000"},{"name":"Yu-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Information Management Department, Chengshiu University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ju","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293329800"},{"name":"Rey-Chue Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rey-Chue","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37286966900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2588-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2587-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6449770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449770","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Neural networks","Wireless communication","Global Positioning System","Probabilistic logic","Vectors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","neural nets","probability","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor positioning","modified probabilistic neural network","received signal strength","RSS","ZigBee sensor network","location based service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor network","received signal strength","indoor positioning","modified probabilistic neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIC.2012.6449770","pdfPath":"/iel5/6409518/6449669/06449770.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Information Security and Intelligent Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Information Security and Intelligent Control","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.2012.6449770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified probability neural network indoor positioning technique","abstract":"This paper presents an indoor positioning technique using a modified probabilistic neural network (MPNN) scheme.

CUDA (an extension to C) is most widely used parallel programming framework for general purpose GPU computations. However, the task of writing optimized CUDA program is complex even for experts. We present a method for restructuring loops into an optimized CUDA kernels based on a 3-step algorithm which are loop tiling, coalesced memory access, and resource optimization. We also establish the relationships between the influencing parameters and propose a method for finding possible tiling solutions with coalesced memory access that best meets the identified constraints. We also present a simplified algorithm for restructuring loops and rewrite them as an efficient CUDA Kernel. The execution model of synthesized kernel consists of uniformly distributing the kernel threads to keep all cores busy while transferring a tailored data locality which is accessed using coalesced pattern to amortize the long latency of the secondary memory. In the evaluation, we implement some simple applications using the proposed restructuring strategy and evaluate the performance in terms of execution time and GPU throughput.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449780","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415466/6449780/06449791.pdf","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of automatic optimization for CUDA programming","doi":"10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449791","startPage":"55","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of automatic optimization for CUDA programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449791/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13291264","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6449791/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of automatic optimization for CUDA programming","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"1569654639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0686S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415466","isNumber":"6449780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415466","xplore-issue":"6449780","articleId":"6449791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6449792,"authors":[{"name":"Mahantesh N.

This paper models a resource pricing strategy using a non-cooperative bargaining game for resource allocation considering dynamics in the grid market.

The main constraint in the implementation of neural network is the area occupied by the multipliers. In order to overcome this area we propose the use of constant coefficient multiplier like distributed arithmetic (DA) based multiplier. The area efficiency is obtained by use of adders and shifters in Distributed arithmetic based multiplier architecture. The distributed arithmetic based multiplier is made use to implement 4:4:2:2:4 and 16:16:8:8:16 artificial neural network architecture for image compression. These architectures are implemented on FPGA and area efficiency is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449805/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13307950","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449805/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed arithmetic multiplier based Artificial Neural Network architecture for image compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed arithmetic multiplier based Artificial Neural Network architecture for image compression","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"1569656125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053305S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415466","isNumber":"6449780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415466","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6449780","articleId":"6449805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6449811,"authors":[{"name":"Punam Suresh Pawar","affiliation":["CE and IT Department, R.

The main challenges in the design of such systems are the limited resources (like transmission power, scarce frequency bandwidth and limited implementation complexity) and the impairments of the wireless channels which includes noise, interference, and fading effects. Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems is one of the most promising wireless technologies that can achieve above requirements. Inter-symbol interference (ISI) is still a major concern even in MIMO systems. It degrades the system performance significantly in frequency selective channels. To mitigate ISI, equalization techniques are employed on receiver side. In this paper, Bit error rate (BER) performance improvements of MIMO systems using various equalization techniques like Zero-forcing (ZF), Minimum mean square error (MMSE), ZF-Successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC), MMSE-SIC, Maximum likelihood (ML) and Sphere decoder (SD) are shown and compared. BER analysis is done under Rayleigh frequency flat and selective as well as under Rician frequency flat channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415466/6449780/06449815.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","doi":"10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER performance improvement in MIMO systems using various equalization techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rician frequency flat channel","Rayleigh frequency flat channel","SD","sphere decoder","ML","maximum likelihood","MMSE-SIC","ZF-SIC","ZF-successive interference cancellation","minimum mean square error","zero-forcing","bit error rate","receiver","frequency selective channel","ISI","intersymbol interference","multiple-input multiple-output system","fading effect","noise effect","wireless channel","wireless communication system","mobile data application","equalization techniques","MIMO system","BER performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","ZF","MMSE","ZF-SIC","MMSE-SIC","ML","SD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"BER performance improvement in MIMO systems using various equalization techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449815/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13307953","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance improvement in MIMO systems using various equalization techniques","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"1569656795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055923S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415466","isNumber":"6449780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415466","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6449780","articleId":"6449815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6449824,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"38548587700"},{"name":"Yong Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37272670700"},{"name":"Lian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Wang","id":"38547622600"},{"name":"Ivan Stojmenovic","affiliation":["TNList, School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","SEECS, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Stojmenovic","id":"37275303300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2925-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2922-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2924-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6449824","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Servers","Mobile computing","Mobile handsets","Energy consumption","Conferences","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy optimization","mobile terminal","computation offloading","rapid development","mobile networking","device capability","energy efficiency","limited battery life","CPU","mobile cloud computing","offloading computation task","energy efficient mobile application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile terminal","energy","computation offloading","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"With the rapid development of mobile networking and device capability, energy efficiency becomes an important design consideration due to the limited battery life of mobile terminals.

It is a set of correspondences between two or more ontologies. There are lots of methods to measure the semantic similarity between entities from several ontologies. To acquire the comprehensive and precise results, all the similarity measures are integrated. Therefore, integrating different similarity measures into a single similarity metric pose a challenging problem. In general, weights corresponding to various similarity measures are assigned manually or through some method. The problem is that it suffers from lack of optimality. There are many evolutionary based approaches to find the optimal solution but they optimize a single objective function. In this article, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for achieving various weights correspond to different similarity measures.

Once the accuracy issue had been addressed, the issue of efficiency detection and maintenance is normally introduced and experimented in most of the scenarios. The later stage of development is dealt with the inter racial classification of diseases which gets over lapped. The problem of detection of brain images into corresponding diseased and Non-Diseased syndrome types for functional Magnetic Resonance Images. The classification problem gets intensified when there comes the inter lapped diseased contents. Among such, overlapped problems occur when there are significant inter-related similar symptoms, similar types of traditional symptoms, common symptoms, where there needs to be minute differences in disease identification. A case occurs with relevance to the shrinking of the frontal lobes and expansion of the back lobes. When a Tumor or a cyst starts protruding, pain occurs followed blurred vision and nausea, unbearable pain and others symptoms. Some of the Alzheimer's symptoms are the shrinking of the frontal lobes and expansion of the behind lobes, followed by memory loss, abnormal behaviour and etc., The process involves the classification among Tumour Vs Alzheimers' classification. The images differ with capturing intensity and noise content. This happens during motion capturing. The choosing up of the images for featuring detection, feature vector calculation and subjecting to training and testing is all carried out from fMRI images. The reason being the functional magnetic Resonance Image properties gets inducted in the fMRI images compared to the other types of images like the PET, CT images etc., A Daubechies Wavelet Transform acting as a smoothening filter was applied playing a dual role in denoising, Decomposition and extraction of frequency feature components for feature vector calculation. A modified median filter removes random noises better which has been induced. A fourth level order of Daubechies Discrete Wavelet decomposition was used for feature vector formation. This was performed because of the blurring results of the images due to the wavelet implication. This naturally destroy the feature coefficients but yet another prominent and effective way in order the classification of the brain images into diseased and non - diseased brain images. The approximated sub - band images were chosen from the input images to train the network. In designing a network using a competitive neural network as a subclass to classify the normal and abnormal image type into corresponding diseased and non - disease types. Initially subjecting to a Competitive Learning, Self - Organized Maps are enhanced to Self - Organized Feature Maps and finally enhanced to Linear Vector Quantization. On comparing to the earlier competitive network, the network of Competitive Learning, SOM and SOFM, and invoking Linear Vector Quantization were considered as improvised for classification and efficient for detection.","doi":"10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449929","startPage":"822","endPage":"827","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415466/6449780/06449929.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelets based decomposition and classification of diseased fMRI brain images for inter racial disease types of Alzheimer's Vs tumors using SOFM and enhancement by LVQ neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","discrete wavelet transforms","diseases","feature extraction","image classification","image denoising","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","patient diagnosis","self-organising feature maps","tumours","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelets based decomposition","diseased fMRI brain image classification","inter racial disease types","Alzheimer","tumors","SOFM","LVQ neural networks","inter racial classification","brain image detection","nondiseased syndrome types","functional magnetic resonance images","disease identification","cyst","blurred vision","nausea","unbearable pain","memory loss","abnormal behaviour","motion capturing","featuring detection","feature vector calculation","training","testing","Daubechies wavelet transform","smoothening filter","frequency feature component denoising","frequency feature component decomposition","frequency feature component extraction","median filter","Daubechies discrete wavelet decomposition","competitive learning","self-organized maps","self-organized feature maps","linear vector quantization","SOM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alzheimer's Disease -AD","Tumors","Artificial Neural Network -

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). To develop the proposed method we use spatial domain as well as frequency domain. To reduce the low frequencies from the input image we use the frequency domain. DWT is used to decompose the input low resolution image into different sub bands. Each of the interpolated high frequency sub band (LH, HL, HH) is then summed up with the interpolated output image of the frequency domain. In order to achieve high resolution image, the estimated high frequency sub bands of the intermediate stage and the interpolated low resolution input image have been combined by using inverse DWT. To generate a better high resolution image particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique has been used. The quantitative (root mean square error, normalized cross correlation, normalized absolute error) and visual outcome show the strength of this proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449941","startPage":"888","endPage":"893","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415466/6449780/06449941.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel hybrid approach to enhance low resolution images using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Continuous wavelet transforms","Optimization","Silicon","Gray-scale","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","discrete wavelet transforms","frequency-domain analysis","image enhancement","image resolution","interpolation","inverse transforms","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid approach","particle swarm optimization","low resolution image enhancement","digital image processing","discrete wavelet transform","PSO","spatial domain","frequency domain","low frequency reduction","low resolution input image decomposition","interpolated high frequency subband","interpolated output image","interpolated low resolution input image","inverse DWT","root mean square error","normalized cross-correlation","normalized absolute error","visual outcome"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform","first fourier transform","interpolation","high pass filter","particle swarm optimization","RMSE","NAE","NCC","low resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel hybrid approach to enhance low resolution images using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6449941/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13291383","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hybrid approach to enhance low resolution images using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"1569674805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069344S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415466","isNumber":"6449780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415466","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6449780","articleId":"6449941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6449947,"authors":[{"name":"Neha Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of CSE and ICT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37085912014"},{"name":"Chhavi Gupta","affiliation":["Department of CSE and ICT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Chhavi","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38244046200"},{"name":"Ankit Khare","affiliation":["Department of CSE and ICT, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Khare","id":"38243377800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2925-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2922-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2924-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6449947","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Nickel","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing system","task duplication scheduling technique","workflow application response time minimisation","grid node","makespan reduction","task duplication reduction","processor utilization enhancement","TLD-P algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid Computing","Duplication task scheduling","Processor utilization","DAG","Workflow applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6449947","abstract":"In dependent task scheduling algorithms, task duplication is the finest scheduling technique for minimizing the response time of workflow application in grid computing system. When we apply task duplication scheduling algorithm on workflow application, we get shorter schedules (makespan) but it has one limitation that grid node can be overloaded due to duplications of tasks. In this paper we are proposing an algorithm in which we are focusing on three points (1) reducing makespan (2) reducing tasks duplication, and (3) achieving better processor utilization. For this we have suggested an algorithm (TLD-P) which is achieving good results for considered parameters as compared to the existing HLD and EDS-G algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449780","publicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 2nd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415466/6449780/06449947.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449947","startPage":"921","endPage":"926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task scheduling through limited duplication with processor utilization in grid computing system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6449947/","displayDocTitle":"Task scheduling through limited duplication with processor utilization in grid computing system","htmlLink":"/document/6449947/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13291388","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task scheduling through limited duplication with processor utilization in grid computing system","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"1569679531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09625S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6415466","isNumber":"6449780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6415466","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6449780","articleId":"6449947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
