When a secondary user occupying a channel detects the presence of a primary call arriving to the channel, it switches from its current channel to another channel, if one is available, to continue its service; however, if the secondary user fails to detect the presence of the primary call, it remains on the channel and both calls will receive degraded service. Based on a queueing network model, we derive closed-form solutions for the equilibrium system state in terms of generating functions, and derive several performance metrics of interest. In particular, we introduce the system supportability metric to evaluate the extent to which the system can support secondary users and the interference factor to evaluate the degree of service degradation imposed on primary users by the secondary users. Numerical results are presented to show the impact of system parameters on the derived performance metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10984750","htmlLink":"/document/5340006/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a cognitive radio network with tolerable service degradation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a cognitive radio network with tolerable service degradation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"rp00281569214935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082173S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335584","isNumber":"5339979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335584","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5339979","articleId":"5340006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5340091,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Politi","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Photonics, H.

With the increase in complexity of realizable quantum architectures, the need for stability and high quality nonclassical interference within large optical circuits has become a matter of concern in modern quantum optics. Using integrated waveguide structures, we demonstrate a high performance platform from which to further develop quantum technologies and experimental quantum physics using single photons. We review the performance of directional couplers in Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments, together with inherently stable interferometers with controlled phase shifts for quantum state preparation, manipulation, and measurement as well as demonstrating the first on-chip quantum metrology experiments. These fundamental components of optical quantum circuits are used together to construct integrated linear optical realizations of two-photon quantum controlled logic gates. The high quality quantum mechanical performance observed at the single photon level signifies their central role in future optical quantum technologies.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2026060","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5340088/05340091.pdf","startPage":"1673","endPage":"1684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2026060","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Quantum Photonics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Quantum Photonics","volume":"15","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"11004965","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340091/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Quantum Photonics","sourcePdf":"jstqe-politi-2026060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11853S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5340088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5340088","articleId":"5340091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340119,"authors":[{"name":"Augusto Tazzoli","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Tazzoli","id":"37397407300"},{"name":"Alberto Gasperin","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Gasperin","id":"37568115500"},{"name":"Alessandro Paccagnella","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Paccagnella","id":"37268172700"},{"name":"Gaudenzio Meneghesso","affiliation":["DEI, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Gaudenzio","lastName":"Meneghesso","id":"37284302600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-58537-176-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5340119","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EOS/ESD sensitivity of phase-change-memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth Observing System","Electrostatic discharge","Testing","Tellurium","Germanium alloys","Tin alloys","Heart","Phase change memory","Robustness","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antimony compounds","chalcogenide glasses","electrostatic discharge","germanium compounds","phase change memories","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor storage","stability","tellurium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EOS sensitivity","ESD sensitivity","phase-change memories","GST alloy structures","analytical storage elements","device robustness","reliability","TLP testing","machine model testing","electrostatic discharge","chalcogenide material","Ge2Sb2Te5"]}],"abstract":"The sensitivity to EOS/ESD events of stand-alone Ge\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nSb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sub>\n (GST) alloy structures, heart of phase change memories, is here investigated.

Further, timestamping accuracy and the stability of the local oscillator of a network synchronized node are the two main influence factors for high accuracy clock synchronization. While the latter is subject to manufacturing technologies, the first is mainly given by the design of the packet timestamper of the node. While common solutions use sampling in minimized intervals to achieve high accuracy, this paper lists other approaches and proposes a method based on phase/frequency estimation. While the additional hardware effort is rather low, the presented method allows for high accuracy. The performance of the developed design is equivalent to a 5.5 GHz sampling clock, but still can be implemented even in low cost digital logic devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340223/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10986075","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High accurate timestamping by phase and frequency estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High accurate timestamping by phase and frequency estimation","confLoc":"Brescia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569225174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046286S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338527","isNumber":"5340193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338527","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5340193","articleId":"5340223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340297,"authors":[{"name":"Danda B.

Several signal detection techniques for spectrum sensing have been proposed in the literature in order to identify idle spectrum so that the CR user can use those idle spectrum bands opportunistically without causing harmful interference to the licensed/primary users. In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of signal detection techniques for spectrum sensing in CR system. We also outline current state of the research and future perspectives.

Symbol timing synchronization using a preamble is affected by the timing of the packet detection and automatic gain control (AGC) completion. However, conventional methods assumed that symbol timing synchronization starts at the beginning of the preamble, which is typically invalid in 802.11n systems. Also, the cyclic shift diversity (CSD) scheme is adopted for achieving spatial diversity and avoiding undesired beamforming in 802.11n standard. However, it induces a pseudo multipath problem which generates multiple-peaks of the cross-correlation. In order to solve these problems, a novel symbol timing synchronization method which is not affected by the pseudo multipath problem is devised. This method estimates a coarse time-offset of short training symbols (STSs) using the cross-correlation and detects a coarse boundary between the last STS and GI which is prior to long training symbols (LTSs) using maximum normalized correlation (MNC)-based algorithm and dividing the preamble into units of STS length. At last, to improve precision of boundary detection, the fine timing of GI start is refined by a verification stage using periodicity of STS. Simulation results show that the proposed method has the SNR gain of 2.4 dB and 3.2 dB compared to the conventional method at the rate of 1% synchronization failure probability in 2TX-2RX and 4TX-4RX WLAN systems, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340303","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340303.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol timing synchronization for IEEE 802.11n WLAN systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Symbol timing synchronization for IEEE 802.11n WLAN systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995326","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340303/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol timing synchronization for IEEE 802.11n WLAN systems","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051167S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340305,"authors":[{"name":"Jaymin Bhalani","affiliation":["V.

It best represents the condition where there are secondary reflections due to high rise structures are always threatening to degrade communication quality. An ANN can be used to provide an estimate of the channel to minimize some of the deficiencies of multi-user transmission under Rayleigh multipath fading. The ANN can be trained to tackle such fading and associated disturbance and improve reception of MIMO-OFDM systems by providing superior bit error rate (BER)s.","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340306","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340306.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANN based Rayleigh multipath fading channel estimation of a MIMO-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ANN based Rayleigh multipath fading channel estimation of a MIMO-OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340306/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10986110","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340306/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN based Rayleigh multipath fading channel estimation of a MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09516S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5340307,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Haleem","affiliation":["College of EME, National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Haleem","id":"37669865700"},{"name":"Shoab A.

One of the critical issues of systems utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the high PAPR of OFDM signals. PAPR reduction schemes increases the computational complexity of high throughput systems. The proposed optimized solution uses common subexpression elimination for reducing the complexity of the OFDM system employing a PAPR reduction scheme. A precoded OFDM system has been used. Constant multiplications involved in the precoding are decomposed into shifts and additions and then common subexpression elimination involving multiple variables is employed to reduce the number of operations involved. This results in improved performance, less area coverage and reduced power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340307","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common sub-expression elimination in PAPR reduction of OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Common sub-expression elimination in PAPR reduction of OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340307/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10986111","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340307/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common sub-expression elimination in PAPR reduction of OFDM system","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036991S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340308,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Estimation is performed using the known pilot's symbols and impulse response of pilots symbols at receiver which is used to find the impulse response of the channel by using linear interpolation. Estimation result will be applied to Zero Forcing algorithms which reduces the multipath effect. Impulse response of channel helps to find out the number of path of each symbol and reduces the Bit error rate of output response. Finally the received signal has passed through Euclidean algorithm which also reduce the Bit Error Rate.","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340309","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340309.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technique for channel estimation in OFDM transmission system using linear interpolation and Euclidean distance algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340309/","displayDocTitle":"Technique for channel estimation in OFDM transmission system using linear interpolation and Euclidean distance algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995328","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340309/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technique for channel estimation in OFDM transmission system using linear interpolation and Euclidean distance algorithm","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071718S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340331,"authors":[{"name":"Rekha Patil","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, P D A College of Engineering, Gulbarga, India"],"firstName":"Rekha","lastName":"Patil","id":"37400023800"},{"name":"A.

The increasing number of wireless users has spurred communications engineers to improve the quality of service. Cellular mobile radio systems aim to provide high spread spectrum signals for digital communications to provide resistance to hostile jamming; to hide the signal by transmitting it at low power, thus, making it difficult for an unintended listener to detect its presence in noise; to make it possible for multiple user to communicate through the same channel. Basically, CDMA system is noise limited, not bandwidth limited. Because the capacity of the CDMA system is depend on signal to noise ratio. It is possible to minimize the noise by using the Gold codes than the usual code.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gold","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Cellular phones","Planets","Standards development","Wireless communication","Power engineering and energy","Quality of service","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","digital communication","mobile communication","random noise","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation analysis","gold codes","Walsh codes","CDMA technology","cellular phone communication","cellular mobile radio systems","digital communications","random noise generator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Spread Spectrum","PN Code","Gold Code","Walsh Code","Random noise generator","Code Generators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340345","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340345","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340345","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation analysis of the gold codes and walsh codes in CDMA technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Correlation analysis of the gold codes and walsh codes in CDMA technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340345/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340345/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995340","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation analysis of the gold codes and walsh codes in CDMA technology","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045127S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5340358,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Ali Habeeb","affiliation":["Software Engineer, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Ahmad Ali","lastName":"Habeeb","id":"37669680600"},{"name":"Mohammed Abdul Qadeer","affiliation":["Software Engineer, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Mohammed Abdul","lastName":"Qadeer","id":"37393578700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4569-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4570-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7801"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0131"}],"articleNumber":"5340358","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Ultrafast electronics","Access protocols","DSL","GSM","3G mobile communication","WiMAX","Mobile computing","Macrocell networks","Communication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference evaluation","mobile station controlled handoff technique","femtocell technology","low-power wireless access point","signal strength","voice quality","macrocell"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Home Node B","Handoff","3GPP","Femto Forum","GSM","UMTS","WiMAX","DSL","Hand over"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells (aka Home Node B) are low-power wireless access points that operate in licensed spectrum to connect standard mobile devices to a mobile operator's network using residential DSL or cable broadband connections.

This paper focuses on the overview of femtocell technology, its potential implementation challenges, Interference evaluation, traditional handoff technique and the suggestion to adopt mobile station (MS) controlled handoff technique that should be adopted in order to successfully handover the control from the mobile operator cell (macrocell) to the femtocell and vice versa.","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340358","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference evaluation and MS controlled handoff technique for femtocell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference evaluation and MS controlled handoff technique for femtocell","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340358/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10986145","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340358/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference evaluation and MS controlled handoff technique for femtocell","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054654S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340361,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Boustani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Boustani","id":"37540923900"},{"name":"Navid MirMotahhary","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"MirMotahhary","id":"37540922700"},{"name":"Reza Danesfahani","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Danesfahani","id":"37282363700"},{"name":"Siavash Khorsandi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Siavash","lastName":"Khorsandi","id":"37270213700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4569-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4570-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7801"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0131"}],"articleNumber":"5340361","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Frequency","Interference","Receiving antennas","Array signal processing","Computer networks","Base stations","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Directional antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency reuse scheme","cell sectorization","OFDMA","wireless networks","cellular environment","interference control","bandwidth classification","inter-cell interference","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","modulation","coding","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency Reuse","Sectorization","Inter-Cell Interference"]}],"abstract":"A unique frequency reuse scheme by means of cell sectorization is proposed in this paper that reuses effectively a given frequency resource in a cellular environment. The key concept is to find a scheme that controls interferences among neighboring cells in a systematic manner while achieving high frequency reuse factor. Based on, user distribution in a cell, two problems are investigated. First, how to appropriately sectorize the cell such that the total received power and the total transmit power of all neighboring base stations is minimized and second is to get the most out of available frequency bandwidth. By using appropriate classification of available bandwidth into 8times4 frequency reuse plan, maximum inter-cell interference (ICI) is avoided when required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is exceeding the required amount due to required modulation and coding. Hence, the proposed system can maintain ICI always at the minimum level, in turn achieving greater spectrum reuse efficiency in comparison with classic fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and soft frequency reuse (SFR) schemes. Finally, based on extensive computer simulations it is verified that the proposed reuse scheme shows good spectrum reuse efficiency while minimizing ICI.","doi":"10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340361","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Himalayas International Conference on Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5338529/5340254/05340361.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHICI.2009.5340361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient frequency reuse scheme by cell sectorization in OFDMA based wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340361/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient frequency reuse scheme by cell sectorization in OFDMA based wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10986147","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340361/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient frequency reuse scheme by cell sectorization in OFDMA based wireless networks","confLoc":"Kathmundu, Nepal","sourcePdf":"s104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075463S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5338529","isNumber":"5340254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5338529","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340254","articleId":"5340361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340382,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yu Cao is an associate professor of electrical engineering at Arizona State University.

In this article, the authors present novel system-level architecture and design innovations to cope with these lifetime reliability challenges. At nanometer-scale geometries, several hardware failure mechanisms, which were largely benign in the past, are becoming visible at the system level. Moreover, recent studies indicate that, depending on the application, hardware failures can be significant contributors to overall system failure rates.Design of robust systems ensuring required hardware reliability, although nontrivial, is achievable but at high costs. Concurrent error detection during system operation is an extremely important aspect of such systems.Hardware reliability challenges arise from three major sources: early-life failures (also called infant mortality), radiation-induced soft errors, and circuit aging. Several techniques, such as Built-in Soft-Error Resilience (BISER), can be effectively used for correcting radiation-induced transient (soft) errors. Focus on early-life failures (ELF) and circuit aging was discussed. These techniques utilize specific characteristics of reliability mechanisms without incurring the high costs of traditional concurrent error detection.","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2009.152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/5340375/05340385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2009.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340375","startPage":"28","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming Early-Life Failure and Aging for Robust Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming Early-Life Failure and Aging for Robust Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995474","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340385/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming Early-Life Failure and Aging for Robust Systems","sourcePdf":"mdt2009060028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072085S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"5340375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5340375","articleId":"5340385","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5340403,"authors":[{"name":"Jon M.

This article outlines the overall network management framework defined in SNMPv3, and then looks at the principal security facilities defined in SNMPv3: authentication, privacy, and access control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"First Quarter  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340405/","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11005475","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"First Quarter 1998","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SNMPv3: A security enhancement for SNMP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNMPv3: A security enhancement for SNMP","sourcePdf":"5340405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023549S","chronDate":"First Quarter  1998","isNumber":"5340399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7041148","citationCount":"72","articleId":"5340405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5340509,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Psounis","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Canada"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Psounis","id":"37299654900"}],"articleNumber":"5340509","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":577},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340509","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Data security","Technology management","Computer languages","Routing","Quality of service","Passive networks","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","multicast communication","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","routers","security issues","congestion control","multicasting","caching","network management","programming language"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMST.1999.5340509","endPage":"16","startPage":"2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys","pdfPath":"/iel5/7041148/5340506/05340509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.1999.5340509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active networks: Applications, security, safety, and architectures","abstract":"Active networks represent a new approach to network architecture. Routers can perform computations on user data, while packets can carry programs to be executed on routers and possibly change their state. Currently, the research community is divided concerning the usefulness of active networks. On the one hand, active networks provide a much more flexible network infrastructure, with increased capabilities. On the other hand, they are obviously more complex than traditional networks and raise considerable security issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a broad survey on active networks. The first goal is to highlight their efficiency in a variety of applications. After presenting some key points on each application, we discuss some current experimental technologies and assess the usefulness of active networks in congestion control, multicasting, caching, and network management. The second goal is to address the security issues that active networks raise: the problem is defined, and techniques for solving it are presented and elaborated upon with a description of a specific implementation of a secure environment and related performance measures. Issues related to the design of a programming language for active networks are also discussed. The third goal is to classify active network architectures based on their design approach. Thus an inclusive presentation of currently proposed architectures, which focuses on their design attributes, capabilities, performance, and security, is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"First Quarter  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340509/","volume":"2","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11005464","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"First Quarter 1999","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Active networks: Applications, security, safety, and architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active networks: Applications, security, safety, and architectures","sourcePdf":"5340509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054433S","chronDate":"First Quarter  1999","isNumber":"5340506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7041148","citationCount":"112","articleId":"5340509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5340513,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen R.

The use of product families allows firms to meet these needs in a cost-competitive manner. The determination of which components to share and which should be unique is very important to the development of product families. Commonality metrics are presented with the goal of assessing (at the early stages of development) the ability of the product family to reduce costs. The methodology of process-based cost modeling is used to project product development, fabrication, and assembly costs in both the standalone and shared situations.

Under specific coupling conditions, the latter circuit can support the SIP associated with the K-\u00bf curves of magnetic photonic crystals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5373967/05340521.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2035943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2035943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5373967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lumped Circuit Models for Degenerate Band Edge and Magnetic Photonic Crystals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic circuits","Photonic crystals","Coupling circuits","Magnetic materials","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Metamaterials","Microstrip components","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anisotropic media","coupled transmission lines","lumped parameter networks","microstrip circuits","microstrip lines","multiport networks","photonic crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degenerate band edge","magnetic photonic crystals","multiport circuit models","periodic anisotropic crystals","stationary inflection points","4-port lumped circuit","microstrip lines","6-port circuit","three-partially-coupled transmission lines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anisotropic media","degenerate band edge","equivalent circuit model","magnetic photonic crystals","stationary inflection point","transmission line model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Lumped Circuit Models for Degenerate Band Edge and Magnetic Photonic Crystals","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5340521/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11084013","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lumped Circuit Models for Degenerate Band Edge and Magnetic Photonic Crystals","sourcePdf":"20lmwc01-gmumcu-2035943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041333S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5373967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5373967","articleId":"5340521","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340522,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro G.

The diagnoses on gain and intracavity-power-controlled anomalous blueshifted spectrum and subpicosecond timing jitter are demonstrated. By increasing the injecting power of the optical NRZ data from -3 to 8 dBm into the SOA bias at different currents, the mode locking is completed with a dc level greatly decreasing from 480 to 50 \u00bfW (only 1.5% of the mode-locked pulse power at 3 mW), corresponding to a pulse/dc amplitude contrast ratio up to 18 dB. Increasing the SOA bias current up to 350 mA significantly suppresses the timing jitter from 1.8 ps to 345 fs, and the extracted RZ clock pulse is shortened from 55 to 27 ps. The pulsewidth of the amplified SOAFL is compressed from 11 ps to 836 fs after dispersion compensation. At constant data injection level, the increasing SOA bias or gain oppositely redshifts the mode-locked SOA fiber ring laser (SOAFL) spectrum by 5 nm. The amplifier spontaneous emission of SOA at short wavelength region ( ~ 1520 nm) is eliminated with increasing NRZ data power, whereas the mode-locking gain peak arises and blueshifts from 1558 to 1552 nm due to the band-filling effect. Such a blueshift in mode-locking spectrum becomes more significant in SOA at lower bias (or gain) condition. A theoretical model interprets the correlation between the nonlinear gain suppression-induced variation of electron-hole plasma in SOA and the blueshifted mode-locking SOAFL spectrum, which is occurred when the gain saturation condition for the SOA becomes more pronounced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340538/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11118814","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electron\u2013Hole Plasma-Induced Spectral Blueshift of Optical-Data Injection Mode-Locked Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Fiber Laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electron\u2013Hole Plasma-Induced Spectral Blueshift of Optical-Data Injection Mode-Locked Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Fiber Laser","sourcePdf":"jlt-lin-2036867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078535S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5379195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5379195","articleId":"5340538","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5340547,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan","Optical Networks Group, Science and Technology Research Institute (STRI), University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Ching-Hung Chang was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in December 1976.

In particular, the displayed 34% increase in the overall channel throughput and 30 times reduction in mean packet delay for service-level 1 and service-level 2 optical network units (ONUs) at accustomed 50% ONU load constitutes the highest extended-reach GPON performance reported up to date.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2037342","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5423316/05340547.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2037342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Service MAC Protocol for Metro-Reach GPONs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340547/","displayDocTitle":"Full-Service MAC Protocol for Metro-Reach GPONs","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11156422","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340547/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Service MAC Protocol for Metro-Reach GPONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-kourtessis-2037342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063108S","chronDate":"April1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5423316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5423316","articleId":"5340547","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5340553,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Gruev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA","University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5482395/5340553/5340553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Viktor Gruev (M'98) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Southern Illinois University in 1997 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in May 2000 and September 2004, respectively.","After finishing his doctoral studies, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked on integrated polarization image sensors and low noise imaging sensors.

A Markov random field model is assumed, and a conditional sampling approach is used to learn local conditional posterior probability distributions on a regional basis. Synthetic SAR sea-ice images and the associated ground-truth segmentations are generated using a region-based posterior sampling approach. Experimental results using single-polarization RADARSAT-1 and dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 SAR sea-ice imagery provided by the Canadian Ice Service show that IceSynth II is capable of producing SAR sea-ice imagery that is more realistic than existing approaches.

Recently, different topologies have been proposed for linearizing PAs using neural based digital predistortion, but most of the previously reported results have been simulation based and addressed the issue of linearizing static or mildly nonlinear PA models. For the first time, a realistic and experimentally validated approach towards adaptive predistortion technique, which takes advantage of the superior dynamic modeling capability of a real-valued focused time-delay neural network (RVFTDNN) for the linearization of third-generation PAs, is proposed in this paper. A comparative study of RVFTDNN and a real-valued recurrent NN has been carried out to establish RVFTDNN as an effective, robust, and easy-to-implement baseband model, which is suitable for inverse modeling of RF PAs and wireless transmitters, to be used as an effective digital predistorter. Efforts have also been made on the selection of the most efficient training algorithm during the reverse modeling of PA, based on the selected NN. The proposed model has been validated for linearizing a mildly nonlinear class AB amplifier and a strongly nonlinear Doherty PA with wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA) signals for single- and multiple-carrier applications. The effects of memory consideration on linearization are clearly shown in the measurement results. An adjacent channel leakage ratio correction of up to 20 dB is reported due to linearization where approximately 5-dB correction is observed due to memory effect nullification for wideband multicarrier WCDMA signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Digital Predistortion of Wireless Power Amplifiers/Transmitters Using Dynamic Real-Valued Focused Time-Delay Line Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2036334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5379166/05340581.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2036334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340581/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Digital Predistortion of Wireless Power Amplifiers/Transmitters Using Dynamic Real-Valued Focused Time-Delay Line Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5340581/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054524","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Digital Predistortion of Wireless Power Amplifiers/Transmitters Using Dynamic Real-Valued Focused Time-Delay Line Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"58tmtt01-mrawat-2036334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073725S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5379166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"5379166","articleId":"5340581","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5340590,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tan","affiliation":["Computation Institute, Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tan","id":"37531861600"},{"name":"Yushun Fan","affiliation":["Department Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yushun","lastName":"Fan","id":"37441759800"},{"name":"MengChu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"MengChu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37273591600"},{"name":"Zhong Tian","affiliation":["China Development Laboratories, IBM Software Group, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37675222900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"5340590","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service oriented architecture","Web services","Automation","Petri nets","Tin","Mediation","Portfolios","Bridges","Contracts","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","Petri nets","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven service composition","enterprise SOA solutions","Petri net approach","service oriented architecture","business domain data","data mediations","service net"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Colored Petri nets","data-driven","service net (SN)","web service composition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340590","abstract":"Under Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), service composition is used to integrate service components together to meet new business needs.

We propose a novel approach to BSS by using precoders in transmitters. We show that if the precoders are properly designed, some cross-correlation coefficients of the coded signals can be forced to be zero at certain time lags. Then, the unique correlation properties of the coded signals can be exploited in receiver to achieve source separation. Based on the proposed precoders, a subspace-based algorithm is derived for the blind separation of mutually correlated sources. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by simulation examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5371895/05340596.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2034518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2034518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Separation of Mutually Correlated Sources Using Precoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Wireless sensor networks","Intelligent sensors","Australia","Surveillance","Receiving antennas","Higher order statistics","Cameras","Blind source separation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","correlation theory","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind separation","mutually correlated source signal","coded signals cross-correlation coefficient","subspace based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation (BSS)","mutually correlated sources","precoders","second-order statistics (SOS)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Neural Networks (Computer)","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Statistics as Topic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind Separation of Mutually Correlated Sources Using Precoders","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5340596/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037348","pubMedId":"19933013","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Separation of Mutually Correlated Sources Using Precoders","sourcePdf":"tnn-yxiang-2034518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124276S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5371895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5371895","articleId":"5340596","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340612,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677456100"},{"name":"Tadashi Shibata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37278610500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"5340612","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":954},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Neural networks","Image generation","Pulse generation","Image storage","CMOS technology","Analog circuits","Pulse circuits","Neural network hardware","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog circuit","pulse-coupled neural networks","very-large-scale integration","VLSI","neuron-MOS technology","biologically inspired models","capacitive coupling effect","switched floating gates","human image perception","CMOS technology","image feature generation","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog circuits","image feature generation","neuron-MOS  $(\\nu {\\rm MOS})$","pulse-coupled neural network","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"An analog circuit for implementing pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) hardware has been developed using the Neuron-MOS (\u03bdMOS) technology. PCNNs are biologically inspired models having powerful ability for image feature generation. With the \u03bdMOS technology, weighted sum of multiple input signals, which is an essential of PCNNs, is implemented simply by the capacitive coupling effect in a \u03bdMOS block. By employing the switched floating gates in the \u03bdMOS blocks as temporary analog memories, the storage of image data is simply realized. Moreover, the function of decay generation, which is crucial for emulating PCNNs neuronal dynamics, is also merged into a \u03bdMOS block by utilizing the input-terminal capacitors in it. With such techniques, the circuit achieves a purely voltage-mode implementation of PCNNs in a compact structure. Inheriting the merits of PCNNs, the circuit has good discriminability against different patterns as well as robustness against rotation and translation of identical patterns, which is analogous to human image perception. The performance of the circuit has been verified by the measurements of a proof-of-concept chip fabricated in a 0.35- \u03bcm double-polysilicon CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5482395/05340612.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5482395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neuron-MOS-Based VLSI Implementation of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks for Image Feature Generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340612/","displayDocTitle":"A Neuron-MOS-Based VLSI Implementation of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks for Image Feature Generation","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11341205","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neuron-MOS-Based VLSI Implementation of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks for Image Feature Generation","sourcePdf":"57tcsi06-jchen-2028751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040194S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"5482395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5340612","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340616,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To solve the problem posed by nonlinear characteristics, kernel partial least squares (KPLS) approaches have been proposed. In this paper, MBKPLS algorithm is first proposed and applied to monitor large-scale processes. The advantages of MBKPLS are: 1) MBKPLS can capture more useful information between and within blocks compared to partial least squares (PLS); 2) MBKPLS gives nonlinear interpretation compared to MBPLS; 3) Fault diagnosis becomes possible if number of sub-blocks is equal to the number of the variables compared to KPLS. The proposed methods are applied to process monitoring of a continuous annealing process. Application results indicate that the proposed decentralized monitoring scheme effectively captures the complex relations in the process and improves the diagnosis ability tremendously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5340619/","accessionNumber":"11105300","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Fault Diagnosis of Large-Scale Processes Using Multiblock Kernel Partial Least Squares","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Fault Diagnosis of Large-Scale Processes Using Multiblock Kernel Partial Least Squares","sourcePdf":"tii-zhang-2033181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065343S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5406290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5406290","articleId":"5340619","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340622,"authors":[{"name":"Peiyuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5452108/5340622/5340622-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peiyuan Chen (S'07) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in electric power engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2006.

The proposed limited-ARIMA (LARIMA) model introduces a limiter and characterizes the stochastic wind power generation by mean level, temporal correlation and driving noise. The model is validated against the measurement in terms of temporal correlation and probability distribution. The LARIMA model outperforms a first-order transition matrix based discrete Markov model in terms of temporal correlation, probability distribution and model parameter number.

Ternary logic is a promising alternative to the conventional binary logic design technique, since it is possible to accomplish simplicity and energy efficiency in modern digital design due to the reduced circuit overhead such as interconnects and chip area. A resistive-load CNTFET-based ternary logic design has been proposed to implement ternary logic based on CNTFET. In this paper, a novel design technique for ternary logic gates based on CNTFETs is proposed and compared with the existing resistive-load CNTFET logic gate designs. Especially, the proposed ternary logic gate design technique combined with the conventional binary logic gate design technique provides an excellent speed and power consumption characteristics in datapath circuit such as full adder and multiplier. Extensive simulation results using SPICE are reported to show that the proposed ternary logic gates consume significantly lower power and delay than the previous resistive-load CNTFET gates implementations. In realistic circuit application, the utilization of the proposed ternary gates combined with binary gates results in over 90% reductions in terms of the power delay product.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2036845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2036845","startPage":"217","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5725264/05340626.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CNTFET-Based Design of Ternary Logic Gates and Arithmetic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"CNTFET-Based Design of Ternary Logic Gates and Arithmetic Circuits","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11851161","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5340626/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNTFET-Based Design of Ternary Logic Gates and Arithmetic Circuits","sourcePdf":"tnano-lin-2036845-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083056S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5725264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"281","xplore-issue":"5725264","articleId":"5340626","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5340628,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chen Li","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5709247/5340628/5340628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Chen Li received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering and the M.S. degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Chung-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

The proposed method works on 1-D gray-level profiles in the horizontal and vertical directions of the surface image. A point distinctly deviated from the ideal line of a profile can be identified as a defect one. A 1-D gray-level profile in the unevenly illuminated image results in a nonstationary line signal. The most commonly used technique for straight line detection in a noisy image is Hough transform (HT). The standard HT requires a sufficient number of points lie exactly on the same straight line at a given parameter resolution so that the accumulator will show a distinct peak in the parameter space. It fails to detect a line in a nonstationary signal. In the proposed HT scheme, the points that contribute to the vote do not have to lie on a line. Instead, a distance tolerance to the line sought is first given. Any point with the distance to the line falls within the tolerance will be accumulated by taking the distance as the voting weight. A fast search procedure to tighten the possible ranges of line parameters is also proposed for mura detection in LCD images.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2034844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5709247/05340628.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2034844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5709247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect Inspection in Low-Contrast LCD Images Using Hough Transform-Based Nonstationary Line Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340628/","displayDocTitle":"Defect Inspection in Low-Contrast LCD Images Using Hough Transform-Based Nonstationary Line Detection","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793740","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340628/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect Inspection in Low-Contrast LCD Images Using Hough Transform-Based Nonstationary Line Detection","sourcePdf":"tii-tsai-2034844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061041S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5709247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5709247","articleId":"5340628","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340629,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Bozza","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Bozza","id":"37299482700"},{"name":"Marina Ottonello","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Ottonello","id":"37397465000"},{"name":"Mirco Raffetto","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genova, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mirco","lastName":"Raffetto","id":"37298146000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5340629","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic modeling","Boundary value problems","Magnetic materials","Numerical simulation","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Metamaterials","Permittivity","Permeability","Pathology","Dielectric losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-value problems","numerical analysis","surface electromagnetic waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ill-posed electromagnetic problems","wrong effective models","boundary value problems","composite media","numerical simulations","common discretizations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary value problems","composite media","electromagnetic surface waves","finite element methods (FEMs)"]}],"abstract":"The set of ill-posed time-harmonic electromagnetic boundary value problems is shown to be much richer than expected so far, when all fine details of composite media are neglected and effective media, possibly anisotropic, are considered.

The circle criterion is applied to designing a nonlinear observer, and no linear growth condition is imposed on nonlinear functions depending on system states. Under the assumption that time-varying delays exist in the system output, only an NN is employed to compensate for all unknown nonlinear terms depending on the delayed output, and thus, the proposed control algorithm is more simple even than the existing NN backstepping control schemes for uncertain systems described by ordinary differential equations. Three examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05340630.pdf","startPage":"939","endPage":"950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive NN Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Stochastic Nonlinear Strict-Feedback Systems With Time-Varying Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive NN Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Stochastic Nonlinear Strict-Feedback Systems With Time-Varying Delays","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293057","pubMedId":"19933016","htmlLink":"/document/5340630/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive NN Backstepping Output-Feedback Control for Stochastic Nonlinear Strict-Feedback Systems With Time-Varying Delays","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-chen-2033808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125982S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"341","xplore-issue":"5464482","articleId":"5340630","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5340631,"authors":[{"name":"Khashayar Salehi Nobandegani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5431116/5340631/5340631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khashayar Salehi Nobandegani was born on September 21, 1980 in Tehran, Iran.

Such inverters are connected to the grid via an L filter or an LCL filter to reduce the harmonics caused by the switching. An LCL filter can reduce the harmonics induced by low switching frequency and generates a satisfactory level of grid-side current using a relatively low inductance, as compared to an L filter. The additional poles introduced by the LC part induces resonance in the system, leading to stability problems; this paper presents a compensation method using power theory to improve these issues, so that the performance of the designed LCL filter system can be improved.

In the proposed control strategy, the system can run in two different modes depending on the power requirement in the microgrid. In mode-1, specified amount of real and reactive power are shared between the utility and the microgrid through the back-to-back converters. Mode-2 is invoked when the power that can be supplied by the distributed generators (DGs) in the microgrid reaches its maximum limit. In such a case, the rest of the power demand of the microgrid has to be supplied by the utility. An arrangement between DGs in the microgrid is proposed to achieve load sharing in both grid connected and islanded modes. The back-to-back converters also provide total frequency isolation between the utility and the microgrid. It is shown that the voltage or frequency fluctuation in the utility side has no impact on voltage or power in microgrid side. Proper relay-breaker operation coordination is proposed during fault along with the blocking of the back-to-back converters for seamless resynchronization. Both impedance and motor type loads are considered to verify the system stability. The impact of dc side voltage fluctuation of the DGs and DG tripping on power sharing is also investigated. The efficacy of the proposed control arrangement has been validated through simulation for various operating conditions. The model of the microgrid power system is simulated in PSCAD.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340642/","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5340642/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11256770","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Management and Power Flow Control With Back-to-Back Converters in a Utility Connected Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Management and Power Flow Control With Back-to-Back Converters in a Utility Connected Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ghosh-2034666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063075S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5340642","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5340645,"authors":[{"name":"Maria De Marsico","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/5353819/5340645/5340645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maria De Marsico (M'99) was born in Salerno, Italy, in 1963.

Many approaches have been presented to solve this special pattern recognition problem, also addressing the challenging cases of face changes, mainly occurring in expression, illumination, or pose. On the other hand, less work can be found in literature that deals with partial occlusions (i.e., sunglasses and scarves). This paper presents face recognition against occlusions and expression variations (FARO) as a new method based on partitioned iterated function systems (PIFSs), which is quite robust with respect to expression changes and partial occlusions. In general, algorithms based on PIFSs compute a map of self-similarities inside the whole input image, searching for correspondences among small square regions. However, traditional algorithms of this kind suffer from local distortions such as occlusions. To overcome such limitation, information extracted by PIFS is made local by working independently on each face component (eyes, nose, and mouth). Distortions introduced by likely occlusions or expression changes are further reduced by means of an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ad hoc</i>\n distance measure. In order to experimentally confirm the robustness of the proposed method to both lighting and expression variations, as well as to occlusions, FARO has been tested using AR-faces database, one of the main benchmarks for the scientific community in this context. A further validation of FARO performances is provided by the experimental results produced on Face Recognition Grand Challenge database.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2033031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5353819/05340645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2033031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353819","startPage":"121","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FARO: FAce Recognition Against Occlusions and Expression Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FARO: FAce Recognition Against Occlusions and Expression Variations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020117","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340645/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FARO: FAce Recognition Against Occlusions and Expression Variations","sourcePdf":"tsmca-riccio-2033031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126199S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5353819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5353819","articleId":"5340645","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340649,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5340649/5340649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei Xiao (S'01\u2013M'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, in 2004.

The superiority of the proposed precoders over the conventional solutions are verified by both simulation and analytical results. The novel approach to precoding design is also applied to the case of an imperfect channel estimate with a known error covariance as well as to the multi-user scenario where precoding based on the nullspace of channel transmission matrix is employed to decouple multi-user channels. In both cases, the improved precoding schemes yield significant performance gain compared to the conventional counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05340649.pdf","startPage":"1768","endPage":"1779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2037347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2037347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Linear Transmit Processing for Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Communications Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mean square error methods","Transmitters","Performance gain","Interference","Design optimization","Filtering","Decision feedback equalizers","Decoding","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear transmit processing","single-user MIMO communications systems","multiuser MIMO communications systems","linear transmit precoding","multiple-input multiple-output systems","signal constellation","zero forcing","minimum mean square error precoder","cost function","nonlinear precoder","error covariance","multiuser scenario","channel transmission matrix","multiuser channels","precoding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear precoding","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)","single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO)","zero-forcing (ZF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Linear Transmit Processing for Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Communications Systems","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5340649/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136147","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Linear Transmit Processing for Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Communications Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-xiao-2037347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087206S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5340649","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340650,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bjornson","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5340650/5340650-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emil Bj\u00f6rnson (S'07) was born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, in 1983.

The minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for channel matrix estimation in Rician fading multi-antenna systems is analyzed, and especially the design of mean square error (MSE) minimizing training sequences. By considering Kronecker-structured systems with a combination of noise and interference and arbitrary training sequence length, we collect and generalize several previous results in the framework. We clarify the conditions for achieving the optimal training sequence structure and show when the spatial training power allocation can be solved explicitly. We also prove that spatial correlation improves the estimation performance and establish how it determines the optimal training sequence length. The analytic results for Kronecker-structured systems are used to derive a heuristic training sequence under general unstructured statistics. The MMSE estimator of the squared Frobenius norm of the channel matrix is also derived and shown to provide far better gain estimates than other approaches. It is shown under which conditions training sequences that minimize the non-convex MSE can be derived explicitly or with low complexity. Numerical examples are used to evaluate the performance of the two estimators for different training sequences and system statistics. We also illustrate how the optimal length of the training sequence often can be shorter than the number of transmit antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2037352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2037352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05340650.pdf","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Training-Based Estimation in Arbitrarily Correlated Rician MIMO Channels With Rician Disturbance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Training-Based Estimation in Arbitrarily Correlated Rician MIMO Channels With Rician Disturbance","volume":"58","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340650/","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136152","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340650/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Training-Based Estimation in Arbitrarily Correlated Rician MIMO Channels With Rician Disturbance","sourcePdf":"tsp-bjornson-2037352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122881S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5340650","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5340654,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Bode","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5357518/5340654/5340654-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dieter Bode received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2006.

The noise margin is significantly improved with respect to p-type-only inverters with similar parameters.

Based on the adaptive control, the dynamic response is improved and more wind energy can be captured during wind velocity variations. For cost and reliability consideration, no mechanical sensors are used in this proposed WPGS. A single-stage ac-to-dc converter is then proposed to replace the traditional two-stage converter and incorporate the MPPT control for achieving higher efficiency and lower total harmonic distortion (THD). To further improve the efficiency of the converter, a quasi-synchronous rectification (QSR) algorithm is proposed to control the active switches for reducing the conduction loss of the body diodes. The analytic closed form duty ratios of the corresponding active switches are also derived for easy implementation. Furthermore, a prototype system is constructed and the proposed MPPT controller and QSR algorithm are both implemented using a DSP, namely, TMS320F2812. Some experimental results are given to verify the validity of the proposed microscale WPGS. It is found that the total output energy can be increased by 13% for the microscale WPGS.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensorless control","Control systems","Wind power generation","Adaptive control","Switches","Programmable control","Wind energy","Energy capture","Wind speed","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","adaptive control","dynamic response","harmonic distortion","maximum power point trackers","power generation control","power system harmonics","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point tracking","sensorless MPPT controller","microscale wind power generation system","adaptive compensation control","dynamic response","AC-DC convertors","total harmonic distortion","quasi-synchronous rectification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High efficiency","maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","wind power generation system (WPGS)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2032604","startPage":"207","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5416618/05340657.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2032604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Sensorless MPPT Controller for a High-Efficiency Microscale Wind Power Generation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Sensorless MPPT Controller for a High-Efficiency Microscale Wind Power Generation System","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11138251","publicationDate":"March 2010","volume":"25","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340657/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Sensorless MPPT Controller for a High-Efficiency Microscale Wind Power Generation System","sourcePdf":"tec-pan-2032604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061931S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5416618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5416618","articleId":"5340657","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340660,"authors":[{"name":"Masanobu Shimada","affiliation":["Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Ibaraki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5461016/5340660/5340660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masanobu Shimada (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in aeronautical engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1977 and 1979, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1999.","He joined the National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA, now known as the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)] in 1979, where he designed a NASDA scatterometer.

ALOS has four mission objectives: cartography, regional observations, disaster observations, and resource exploration. It has been operational since its launch in January 24, 2006, and is acquiring a large amount of land-surface data supported by the Ka-band intersatellite communication system that downlinks to ground receiving stations. A global systematic acquisition strategy is implemented for all three sensors to enable consistent data collection over all land areas on a repetitive basis. Through its three sensors, acquisition strategy, and communication infrastructure, the ALOS mission is aimed to contribute to monitoring water, carbon, and global climate change.

One of the major factors affecting the soft-error rates is single-event transient (SET) pulsewidths. The SET pulsewidths, which are controlled by drift, diffusion, and parasitic bipolar-transistor parameters, are a strong function of operating temperature. In this paper, heavy-ion induced SET pulsewidths are reported at temperatures ranging from 25\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, as measured with an autonomous SET capture circuit. Experimental and simulation results in a 90-nm bulk CMOS technology indicate an increase of as high as 37% in measured average SET pulsewidth with increasing operating temperature, with some pulses almost 2 ns long at higher temperatures. The increase in the SET pulsewidth can be explained by the dependence of parasitic bipolar-transistor characteristics on temperature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11156321","htmlLink":"/document/5340671/","displayDocTitle":"Increased Single-Event Transient Pulsewidths in a 90-nm Bulk CMOS Technology Operating at Elevated Temperatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased Single-Event Transient Pulsewidths in a 90-nm Bulk CMOS Technology Operating at Elevated Temperatures","sourcePdf":"tdmr-gadlage-2036719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099008S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"5424173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5424173","articleId":"5340671","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5340680,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Wang","affiliation":["Center of Sensorsystems (ZESS), University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5437364/5340680/5340680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Wang (M'07) received the B.S. degree in control engineering from the University of Henan, Kaifeng, China, in 2002 and the Dr. Eng. degree from the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2007.","In 2007, he joined the Center for Sensorsystems (ZESS), University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany, where he is currently working on the hybrid bistatic experiment.

However, the long signal duration time leads to the failure of the conventional start/stop approximation of the pulsed SAR. In this paper, a signal model is proposed to address the effects of the continuous motion during the transmit time on the echoed signal. Based on the model, an analytical point target reference spectrum is derived. From the spectrum, it will be seen that the continuous motion introduces an additional range-azimuth coupling term and a range walk term compared with the conventional pulsed SAR. The range walk term is well known, whereas the foregoing range-azimuth coupling term is formulated for the first time in the FMCW SAR community. For the squint and spotlight modes, these range walk and range-azimuth coupling terms might significantly degrade the image quality. In this paper, based on the proposed analytical signal model, we further discuss the application of the wavenumber domain algorithm for the FMCW SAR data. In addition, different approximations of the Stolt mapping are made to highlight the effect of the range-dependent higher-order range-azimuth coupling terms on the 2-D impulse responses. Finally, X-band simulated experiments and Ka-band real FMCW SAR data are used to validate the signal model and the processing method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focus FMCW SAR Data Using the Wavenumber Domain Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2034368","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5437364/05340680.pdf","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2034368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Focus FMCW SAR Data Using the Wavenumber Domain Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5340680/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204338","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focus FMCW SAR Data Using the Wavenumber Domain Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2034368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10251S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5437364","articleId":"5340680","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340683,"authors":[{"name":"Iskandar A.

It was first conceived to generate 3-D images of conducting as well as nonconducting surfaces with a high degree of accuracy. Presently, it is also being used in applications that involve manipulation of material surfaces at a nanoscale. In this paper, we describe a new scanning method for fast atomic force microscopy. In this technique, the sample is scanned in a spiral pattern instead of the well-established raster pattern. A constant angular velocity spiral scan can be produced by applying single frequency cosine and sine signals with slowly varying amplitudes to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\n-axis and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i>\n -axis of AFM nanopositioner, respectively. The use of single-frequency input signals allows the scanner to move at high speeds without exciting the mechanical resonance of the device. Alternatively, the frequency of the sinusoidal set points can be varied to maintain a constant linear velocity (CLV) while a spiral trajectory is being traced. Thus, producing a CLV spiral. These scan methods can be incorporated into most modern AFMs with minimal effort since they can be implemented in software using the existing hardware. Experimental results obtained by implementing the method on a commercial AFM indicate that high-quality images can be generated at scan frequencies well beyond the raster scans.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2036844","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5725264/05340683.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2036844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","startPage":"203","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Scanning Method for Fast Atomic Force Microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Scanning Method for Fast Atomic Force Microscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340683/","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5340683/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11851162","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Scanning Method for Fast Atomic Force Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tnano-mahmood-2036844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113821S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5725264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5725264","articleId":"5340683","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5340685,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Steurer","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5427230/5340685/5340685-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Steurer (M'01\u2013SM'07) received the M.E.E. degree from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree in technical science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2001.","He is currently a Senior Researcher with the Center for Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, where he leads the power systems group focusing on hardware-in-the-loop simulation and modeling of integrated power systems for all-electric ships and future terrestrial power systems.

In particular, a commercial 2.5-MW variable speed motor drive (VSD) with active front end was connected to a virtual power system using the VVS for integrating the drive with a simulated power system. An illustrative example is given, whereby a 4-MW gas turbine generator system, including various loads, is simulated and interfaced with the VSD hardware in the lab through the VVS using current feedback to the simulation. Mechanical loading is applied to the motor via an identical 2.5-MW dynamometer connected to the same shaft. This paper first describes the PHIL facility, illustrates the challenges of powering a motor drive from a controlled voltage source converter at the multimegawatt scale, and provides experimental results from dynamic simulations. While certain challenges remain with the accuracy of the interface, it is concluded that PHIL simulations at the megawatt power level are possible and may prove useful for validating models of drive systems in the future.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2036639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05340685.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2036639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","startPage":"1254","endPage":"1260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Megawatt-Scale Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation Setup for Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Megawatt-Scale Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation Setup for Motor Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340685/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168802","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5340685/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Megawatt-Scale Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation Setup for Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tie-edrington-2036639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082994S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5340685","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340691,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco A.

The discrete Fourier transform is applied to the three-phase signals represented by Clarke's \u03b1\u03b2 vector. It is shown that the complex numbers output from the Fourier transform are the instantaneous values of the positive- and negative-sequence harmonic component vectors of the input three-phase signals. The method allows the computation of any desired positive- or negative-sequence fundamental-frequency or harmonic vector component of the input signal. A recursive algorithm for low-effort online implementation is also presented. The detection performance for variable-frequency and interharmonic input signals is discussed. The proposed and other usual method performances are compared through simulations and experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5508599/05340691.pdf","startPage":"2858","endPage":"2867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2036646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2036646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space-Vector Discrete Fourier Transform for Unbalanced and Distorted Three-Phase Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Distortion","Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","Voltage","Fourier transforms","Active filters","Converters","Power conversion","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","harmonic distortion","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector discrete Fourier transform","three-phase signal distortion","harmonic vector component","interharmonic input signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active filters","amplitude and phase estimation","discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs)","industrial power system harmonics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Vector Discrete Fourier Transform for Unbalanced and Distorted Three-Phase Signals","volume":"57","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465105","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Vector Discrete Fourier Transform for Unbalanced and Distorted Three-Phase Signals","sourcePdf":"tie-neves-2036646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056275S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","articleId":"5340691","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340692,"authors":[{"name":"Ansheng Liu","affiliation":["Photonics Technology Laboratory, Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ansheng Liu received the B.S. degree in semiconductor physics from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in semiconductor physics from Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, China, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark, in 1992.","He is currently a Principal Engineer with the Photonics Technology Laboratory, Intel Labs, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, where he is developing silicon photonic devices and photonic integrated circuits for high-speed optical interconnect and communications.

Piezoelectric ceramic material, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), has large stress and bandwidth, but its extremely small strain, i.e., only 0.1%, has been a major bottleneck for broad applications. This paper presents a new strain amplification design, called a \u201cnested rhombus\u201d multilayer mechanism, that increases strain exponentially through its hierarchical cellular structure. This allows for over 20% effective strain. In order to design the whole actuator structure, not only the compliance of piezoelectric material but also the compliance of the amplification structures needs to be taken into account. This paper addresses how the output force and displacement are attenuated by the compliance involved in the strain amplification mechanism through kinematic and static analysis. An insightful lumped parameter model is proposed to quantify the performance degradation and facilitate design tradeoffs. A prototype-nested PZT cellular actuator that weighs only 15 g has produced 21% effective strain (2.5 mm displacement from 12-mm actuator length and 30 mm width) and 1.7 N blocking force.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piezoelectric actuators","Capacitive sensors","Piezoelectric materials","Ceramics","Biological materials","Titanium compounds","Stress","Bandwidth","Nonhomogeneous media","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplification","piezoelectric actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large effective-strain piezoelectric actuators","nested cellular architecture","exponential strain amplification mechanisms","piezoelectric ceramic material","lead zirconate titanate","nested rhombus multilayer mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Actuators","flexible structures","piezoelectric transducers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2034973","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5536924/05340695.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2034973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Effective-Strain Piezoelectric Actuators Using Nested Cellular Architecture With Exponential Strain Amplification Mechanisms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Large Effective-Strain Piezoelectric Actuators Using Nested Cellular Architecture With Exponential Strain Amplification Mechanisms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340695/","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340695/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11450150","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Effective-Strain Piezoelectric Actuators Using Nested Cellular Architecture With Exponential Strain Amplification Mechanisms","sourcePdf":"tmech-ueda-2034973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06796S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5536924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5536924","articleId":"5340695","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340696,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Fang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Fang","id":"38557219300"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5340696","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":333},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Frequency","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Delay","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Scattering","Fading","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","data models","mean square error methods","radio receivers","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block coding","time-selective channels","frequency-selective channels","doubly-selective channels","Alamouti code","time-frequency reversal","transmitted sequences","Doppler diversity","maximum-likelihood receiver","linear zero-forcing","linear minimum mean-squared error receiver","real-valued linear data model","receiver structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay diversity","Doppler diversity","doubly-selective channels","space\u2013time block coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340696","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new space-time block code for time- and frequency-selective (doubly-selective) channels.

In the Gaussian case, these models are directly related to the sparsity of the inverse covariance (concentration) matrix and allow for improved covariance estimation with lower computational complexity. We consider concentration estimation with the mean-squared error (MSE) as the objective, in a special type of model known as decomposable. This model includes, for example, the well known banded structure and other cases encountered in practice. Our first contribution is the derivation and analysis of the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) in decomposable graphical models. We provide a simple closed form solution to the MVUE and compare it with the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in terms of performance and complexity. Next, we extend the celebrated Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) to graphical models. Using SURE, we prove that the MSE of the MVUE is always smaller or equal to that of the biased MLE, and that the MVUE itself is dominated by other approaches. In addition, we propose the use of SURE as a constructive mechanism for deriving new covariance estimators. Similarly to the classical MLE, all of our proposed estimators have simple closed form solutions but result in a significant reduction in MSE.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2037350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2037350","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05340697.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariance Estimation in Decomposable Gaussian Graphical Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Covariance Estimation in Decomposable Gaussian Graphical Models","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340697/","accessionNumber":"11136143","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340697/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariance Estimation in Decomposable Gaussian Graphical Models","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-awiesel-2037350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135386S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5340697","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5340699,"authors":[{"name":"Changzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Changzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37291265800"},{"name":"Jenshan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jenshan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278771300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5340699","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3328},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Radar applications","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Circuit testing","CMOS process","Printed circuits","Circuit optimization","Energy consumption","Ultra wideband technology","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit tuning","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","integrated circuit design","MMIC oscillators","radar equipment","UHF oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-wide-tuning-range quadrature ring oscillator","UMC CMOS process","printed circuit board","low power consumption","voltage controlled oscillator","noncontact vital sign radar sensor","ultra-wideband impulse radio application","clock recovery application","VCO","frequency 1 GHz to 9 GHz","size 130 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","linear-tuning","low-power","non-contact","quadrature","radar","Ring oscillator","vital sign"]}],"abstract":"A 1-9 GHz linear-wide-tuning-range quadrature ring oscillator has been designed and fabricated in UMC 0.13 \u00bfm CMOS process.

In this paper, we propose a predictive model for the space-time dynamics of vegetation indexes (VIs) obtained from remote-sensing data through a two-step approach. In the first step, we quantify the deterministic component of the vegetation variations with an additive model that includes seasonal components, interannual trends, and jump discontinuities. The second step captures the dynamics of random residuals (anomalies) with a predictive multidimensional model accounting for the autoregressive (AR) characteristics and spatial correlations of the vegetation fields. The overall goal of the model is to provide short lead-time predictions (from two weeks to one month ahead) of vegetation for management purposes, including irrigation applications in croplands and fire-hazard assessment in natural forests. The proposed model is tested using MODIS-based normalized difference VI (NDVI) and enhanced VI (EVI) data over the period of March 2000 to December 2006 over Italy. Model performance is quantified for five major land covers, including agricultural areas and natural forests. Finally, the analysis is carried out at different levels of spatial aggregation (1-8 km) to investigate the efficacy of the model at different spatial scales. The results show that a simple additive deterministic model explains well the temporal vegetation variability, while the spatial-AR contributions generally improve the forecast accuracy, particularly for croplands. Coherent biophysical patterns are also detected through the proposed predictive model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5437362/05340704.pdf","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2035110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2035110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Predictive Multidimensional Model for Vegetation Anomalies Derived From Remote-Sensing Observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Predictive models","Remote sensing","Vegetation mapping","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Irrigation","Satellite broadcasting","Remote monitoring","Testing","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","spatiotemporal phenomena","vegetation","vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive multidimensional model","vegetation anomalies","remote sensing observations","spatiotemporal variability","terrestrial vegetation","space-time dynamics","vegetation indexes","deterministic component","random residuals","autoregressive characteristics","short lead-time predictions","vegetation management","irrigation","croplands","fire-hazard assessment","natural forests","MODIS-based normalized difference VI","NDVI","enhanced VI","EVI","AD 2000 03 to 2006 12","Italy","land covers","agricultural areas","spatial aggregation","additive deterministic model","temporal vegetation variability","spatial-AR contributions","forecast accuracy","coherent biophysical patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Enhanced vegetation index (EVI)","normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)","space-time autoregressive (STAR) model","space-time forecasting","vegetation dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Predictive Multidimensional Model for Vegetation Anomalies Derived From Remote-Sensing Observations","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5340704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204323","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Predictive Multidimensional Model for Vegetation Anomalies Derived From Remote-Sensing Observations","sourcePdf":"tgrs-forzieri-2035110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120205S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5437362","articleId":"5340704","onlineDate":"24 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5340709,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Bettstetter","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bettstetter","id":"37265503000"},{"name":"Hans-Jorg Vogel","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Jorg","lastName":"Vogel","id":"37342284700"},{"name":"Jorg Eberspacher","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Eberspacher","id":"37418633100"}],"articleNumber":"5340709","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":27,"totalDownloads":1444},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340709","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["GSM","Packet radio networks","Ground penetrating radar","IP networks","Packet switching","Access protocols","Web and internet services","Switching circuits","Wireless application protocol","Mobile radio mobility management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel coding","internetworking","IP networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","packet radio networks","protocols","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GSM phase 2+","general packet radio service","GPRS protocol architecture","GPRS air interface","wireless access","Internet","data packet transfer","mobile station","external packet data network routing","mobility management","channel coding","interworking example","IP network"]}],"abstract":"The general packet radio service (GPRS) is a new bearer service for GSM that greatly improves and simplifies wireless access to packet data networks, e.g., to the Internet.

We use numerous evaluation criteria, including network, economic, and social efficiency, as well as their suitability in using pricing as a means for congestion control. Some of the schemes are based on best-effort networks, and are thus unable to provide the user with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Others build on networks with connection admission control functions and are thus able to provide individual QoS guarantees. We particularly investigate the relevant time frame over which pricing schemes are assumed to operate. The majority of the schemes work on short time frames (on the order of minutes), which makes them applicable to use pricing as an additional means for controlling congestion. We also consider technical aspects such as compliance with existing networking technologies or computational overheads associated with billing and accounting.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2000.5340798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5340795/05340798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2000.5340798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340795","startPage":"2","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of pricing concepts for broadband IP networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An overview of pricing concepts for broadband IP networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Second Quarter  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2000","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of pricing concepts for broadband IP networks","sourcePdf":"5340798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061647S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2000","isNumber":"5340795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"153","articleId":"5340798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340799,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Chandra V.

At the same time, we see a convergence of the telephone, cable and data networks into a unified network that supports multimedia and real-time applications like voice and video in addition to data. Medium access control protocols define rules for orderly access to the shared medium and play a crucial role in the efficient and fair sharing of scarce wireless bandwidth. The nature of the wireless channel brings new issues like location-dependent carrier sensing, time varying channel and burst errors. Low power requirements and half duplex operation of the wireless systems add to the challenge. Wireless MAC protocols have been heavily researched and a plethora of protocols have been proposed. Protocols have been devised for different types of architectures, different applications and different media. This survey discusses the challenges in the design of wireless MAC protocols, classifies them based on architecture and mode of operation, and describes their relative performance and application domains in which they are best deployed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5340795/05340799.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2000.5340799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2000.5340799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340795","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless medium access control protocols","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless networks","Telephony","Communication cables","Bandwidth","Planets","Quality of service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Second Quarter  2000","displayDocTitle":"Wireless medium access control protocols","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2000","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless medium access control protocols","sourcePdf":"5340799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148295S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2000","isNumber":"5340795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"149","articleId":"5340799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5340803,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan M.

Moreover, there are no delimiters (blank space) to show word boundaries. Currently, most named entity extraction methods for Thai language are associated with word segmentation and part of speech (POS) tagging processes. The accuracy of named entity extraction is mostly affected the efficiency of those processes. At present, it is still lack of suitable methods for identifying the boundary of word for Thai sentence. Therefore this paper proposes the method to extract Thai personal named entity without using word segmentation or POS tagging. The proposed method is composed of 3 steps. Firstly, pre-processing, this process is used to remove non alphabet such as parenthesizes and numerical. Then, personal named entity is extracted by using contextual environment, front and rear, of personal name. Finally, post-processing, a simple rule base is employed to identify personal names. The training corpus of 900 political news articles and the test corpus of 100 political news, 100 financial news and 100 sport news articles were used in the experiments. The results showed that the F-measures in political and financial domain are 91.442% and 91.720% respectively which are nearly the same. However, the proposed scheme used neither word segmentation nor POS tagging process that can significantly reduce the effort and speed up the process in building the training corpus.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339382/5340906/05340914.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thai personal named entity extraction without using word segmentation or POS tagging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tagging","Natural languages","Data mining","Entropy","Testing","Natural language processing","Information retrieval","Text recognition","Guidelines","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Thai personal named entity extraction","word segmentation","POS tagging","blank space","part of speech","word boundary identification","contextual environment","rule base","text analysis","political news article","financial news article","sport news article","machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thai personal named entity extraction without using word segmentation or POS tagging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000629","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thai personal named entity extraction without using word segmentation or POS tagging","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068581S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339382","isNumber":"5340906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5340906","articleId":"5340914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5340935,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The classification performance obtained by five different types of neural networks for comparison are back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), general regression neural network (GRNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and complementary neural network (CMTNN). The comparison is done based on three benchmark data sets obtained from UCI machine learning repository.

This problem causes an indexing technique has become a main issue in Thai text retrieval. To construct an inverted index for Thai texts, an index terms extraction technique is usually required to segment texts into index term schemes. Although index terms can be specified manually by experts, this process is very time consuming and labor-intensive. Word segmentation is one of the many techniques that are used to automatically extract index terms from Thai texts. However, most of the word segmentation techniques require linguistic knowledge and the preparation of these approaches is time consuming. An n-gram based approach is another automatic index terms extraction method that is often used as indexing technique for Asian languages including Thai. This approach is language independent which does not require any linguistic knowledge or dictionary. Although the n-gram approach out performs many indexing techniques for Asian languages in term of retrieval effectiveness, the disadvantage of n-gram approach is it suffers from large storage space and long retrieval time. In this paper we present the frequent max substring mining to extract index terms from Thai texts. Our method is language-independent and it does not rely on any dictionary or language grammatical knowledge. Frequent max substring mining is based on text mining that describes a process of discovering useful information or knowledge from unstructured texts. This approach uses the analysis of frequent max substring sets to extract all long and frequently-occurred substrings. We aim to employ the frequent max substring mining algorithm to address the drawback of n-gram based approach by keeping only frequent max substrings to reduce disk space requirement for storing index terms and to reduce the retrieval time in order to deal with the rapid growth of Thai texts.","doi":"10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340946","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339382/5340906/05340946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340906","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic indexing technique for Thai texts using frequent max substring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An automatic indexing technique for Thai texts using frequent max substring","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340946/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000661","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5340946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic indexing technique for Thai texts using frequent max substring","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"P13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056812S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339382","isNumber":"5340906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339382","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5340906","articleId":"5340946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-07"},{"_id":5340967,"authors":[{"name":"Sungho Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37292257500"},{"name":"Sung-Moon Shin","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Moon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37366091800"},{"name":"Soonchul Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soonchul","lastName":"Park","id":"37657114700"},{"name":"Ho-Shin Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Shin","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276159200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5340967","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Throughput","Frequency conversion","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive systems","Power engineering and energy","Computer science","Signal processing","Mobile communication","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","channel capacity","channel coding","frequency division multiple access","modulation coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation scheme","discrete capacity function maximization","OFDMA system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","adaptive modulation-coding scheme","AMC level"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive power allocation method for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system that employs an adaptive modulation and coding(AMC) scheme.

We have to point out that jointly estimating the channel from source to relay and relay to destination suffers from many drawbacks in fast fading case because the estimation of previous pilots is not suitable for current channel. In this paper we consider a new joint estimation of overall channel impulse response (CIR) using one OFDM signal without pilots. Using the maximum likelihood (ML) function, we derive a channel estimator by taking the frequency domain of transmitted signal as Gaussian and averaging the ML function over the resulting Gaussian distribution. Simulation results show that our proposed channel estimator performs a fraction of 1dB compared in high SNR region.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5340968","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05340968.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5340968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation in asynchronous amplify-and-forward relay networks based on OFDM signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5340968/","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation in asynchronous amplify-and-forward relay networks based on OFDM signaling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999785","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5340968/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation in asynchronous amplify-and-forward relay networks based on OFDM signaling","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4A6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056424S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5340968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5340969,"authors":[{"name":"Weigang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Weigang Zhao","id":"37087947743"},{"name":"Yanhong Kou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, China"],"lastName":"Yanhong Kou","id":"37088209110"},{"name":"Qishan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, China"],"lastName":"Qishan Zhang","id":"37087144082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5340969","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5340969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Flexible printed circuits","Diversity reception","Frequency synchronization","Railway engineering","Global Positioning System","Doppler shift","Discrete Fourier transforms","Digital filters","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","matched filters","probability","pseudonoise codes","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmented matched filter","PN code fast acquisition","DS-SS systems","direct-sequence spread spectrum system","synchronization","maximum selection method","probability density function","GPS receiver","data modulation","global positioning system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High dynamic receivers","Synchronization","PN code acquisition","Segmented matched filter","Differential coherent combined"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5340969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmented matched filter with differentially coherent combined for PN code fast acquisition","startPage":"876","endPage":"880","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05340969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5340969","abstract":"In high dynamic environment, the PN code acquisition is one of the most challenging step in the process of DS/SS systems Synchronization.

The proposed FDFS-LMMSE receiver is shown to significantly outperform the conventional LMMSE receiver (without oversampling) in multipath fading channels. This is because the FDFS-LMMSE receiver is able to exploit multipath/frequency diversity inherent to the channel to improve performance. Next, based on a Gaussian approximation to inter-carrier interference (ICI), we present a semi-analytical performance analysis for the FDFS-LMMSE receiver. The accuracy of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by simulations. Finally, we study the effect of the oversampling factor on the system performance, aiming at finding an optimal oversampling factor in terms of both performance and complexity. It is found that the optimal frequency oversampling factor, usually much smaller than 2, is determined by the number of subcarriers and the number of multipath components.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341017","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341017.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain oversampling for OFDM systems: Exploiting inter-carrier interference and multipath diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain oversampling for OFDM systems: Exploiting inter-carrier interference and multipath diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341017/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999756","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341017/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain oversampling for OFDM systems: Exploiting inter-carrier interference and multipath diversity","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041125S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5341018,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Geon An","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Geon","lastName":"An","id":"37672317700"},{"name":"Sang Burm Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Burm","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37652137100"},{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341018","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Autocorrelation","Polynomials","Robustness","Interference","Bandwidth","High power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance improvement","OFDM system","CAZAC sequence","adaptive pre distorter","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiplex path interference","bandwidth efficiency","high speed communication system","PAPR","peak average power ratio","high power amplifier","constant amplitude zero auto-correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CAZAC Matrix","PAPR","HPA","pre-distorter","NLMS"]}],"abstract":"OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) communication system is very robust to the multiplex path interference, and its bandwidth efficiency is also very good for the design of the high speed communication system. However, high PAPR (peak average power ratio) is major drawbacks of OFDM system. In the nonlinear HPA (high power amplifier), the OFDM signal suffers serious nonlinear distortion and generally, this HPA is considered as memoryless device. So, combination of predistorter and CAZAC (Constant amplitude zero auto-correlation) matrix transform which has the autocorrelation characteristic and the regular power distribution both time domain and frequency domain are good solution to this high PAPR problem. But the situation will be different when the nonlinear HPA has memory property. In this paper, therefore, we analyze the PAPR reduction effects on Saleh HPA and memory polynomial HPA when CAZAC matrix transform and digital adaptive NLMS (normalized least mean square) predistorter are used at the same time. The memory polynomial model is used for the consideration of HPA memory effect. Also we show the performance variation in the HPA nonlinear characteristic according to change of IBO (input back off) value. From the simulation results for performance analysis, we can confirm that the proposed combined system shows better BER performance even in when the effect of HPA is considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM system using CAZAC sequence and adaptive pre-distorter","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341018","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341018.pdf","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of OFDM system using CAZAC sequence and adaptive pre-distorter","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341018/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999757","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of OFDM system using CAZAC sequence and adaptive pre-distorter","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077426S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5341022,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Nokia, Inc."],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280262200"},{"name":"Sang Jun Bae","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communications Center, Inha university, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Jun","lastName":"Bae","id":"37673558900"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communications Center, Inha university, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341022","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback","MIMO","Propagation losses","Frequency response","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","matrix decomposition","MIMO communication","time-domain analysis","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming method","wireless system","reduced feedback","time-domain channel matrix decomposition","MIMO channel environment","BER performance","impulse response","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341022","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341022","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","abstract":"A beamforming method is proposed for the wireless systems in 60 GHz band with limited feedback overhead by properly decomposing the time-domain channel impulse response matrix.

As a result, the trellis-coded 3-D OFDM system has around 6 dB coding gain over an uncoded one when an 8-ary constellation is exploited. And it also has around 3 dB better symbol error probability as compared to the uncoded system when a 4-ary constellation is employed.

In this paper an energy efficient MAC protocol (BodyMAC) is proposed. It uses flexible bandwidth allocation to improve node energy efficiency by reducing the possibility of packet collisions and by reducing radio transmission times, idle listening and control packets overhead. BodyMAC is based on a Downlink and Uplink scheme in which the Contention Free Part in the Uplink subframe is completely collision free. Three types of bandwidth allocation mechanisms allow for flexible and efficient data and control communications. An efficient Sleep Mode is introduced to reduce the idle listening duration, especially for low duty cycle nodes in the network.

It is also shown that the system performance can be substantially improved by increasing the number of iterations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of double binary turbo coded OFDM in PLC channel","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341056","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341056.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of double binary turbo coded OFDM in PLC channel","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341056/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999825","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of double binary turbo coded OFDM in PLC channel","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5A5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035331S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341068,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhigang Xu","id":"37592069600"},{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qi Liu","id":"37654362900"},{"name":"Chengshi Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","UWB ITRC, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chengshi Zhao","id":"37396943400"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB ITRC, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341068","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Antenna arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Sensor arrays","Resource management","Chromium","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Directive antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cognitive radio","multibeam antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-antenna beams","cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing","antenna array","primary user detection","multiple beams","directional beam","energy detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","antenna array","multiple beams","energy detector"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sense utilizing multi-antenna beams scanning in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","endPage":"1374","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341068","startPage":"1369","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341068","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is one of the most important functions for cognitive radio.

A programmable lowpass RC filter has been designed that is controlled by the bandwidth control word. Complete system has been implemented on a xilinx Spartan FPGA. The digital clock manager of FPGA device has been employed to generate multiples of the system clock to compensate bandwidth reduction effect of the single-bit DAC as well as to manage the power budget. ROM compression has been achieved by separately generating the two most significant amplitude bits by a combinational circuit. This arrangement provides an additional 20% compression of ROM. An SFDR of about 66 dBc has been achieved for pre DAC stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341073.pdf","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1404","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based bandwidth adjustable all digital direct frequency synthesizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Bandwidth","Frequency synthesizers","Pulse width modulation","Read only memory","Radio control","Clocks","Energy management","Financial management","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct digital synthesis","field programmable gate arrays","low-pass filters","programmable logic devices","read-only storage","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital direct frequency synthesizer","compressed ROM","pulse width modulation technique","PWM technique","programmable lowpass RC filter","bandwidth control word","digital clock manager","FPGA device","bandwidth reduction effect compensation","single-bit DAC","power budget management","combinational circuit","lookup table","read-only storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based bandwidth adjustable all digital direct frequency synthesizer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341073/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999842","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based bandwidth adjustable all digital direct frequency synthesizer","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"6B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040445S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341079,"authors":[{"name":"Chavee Issariyapat","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chavee","lastName":"Issariyapat","id":"37680733400"},{"name":"Kensuke Fukuda","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensuke","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37267382300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341079","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Principal component analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Signal processing algorithms","Traffic control","Electronic mail","Network interfaces","Predictive models","Computer networks","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","IP networks","principal component analysis","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP network anomaly detection","principal component analysis","PCA technique","anomalous traffic feature distribution aggregation","origin-destination flow","single network interface","experimental result","preliminary detection system","sample entropy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the application of PCA to the IP network anomaly detection.

This paper examines the use of unitary differential space-time frequency codes (DSTFCs) in MB-OFDM UWB, which increases the system bandwidth efficiency due to the fact that no CSI is required for differential detection. The proposed DSTFC MB-OFDM system would be useful when the transmission of multiple channel estimation symbols is impractical or uneconomical.

this paper, the analysis of an average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a cooperative communication network with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays is presented. In AF systems, the overall instantaneous SNR at the receiving end can be expressed as the form of a harmonic mean of per-hop SNRs. This means that the received SNR can be analyzed by applying the statistical expectation of the harmonic mean of two exponential random variables, which was derived in a closed-form expression. The proposed result can help examining the performance of AF relay systems by using the average sense approach. The simulation results demonstrate the exact derivation of the expectation of harmonic means. The result also shows that the destination node can obtain larger average received SNR as the number of relay nodes is increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341112/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999928","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Average approach to amplify-and-forward relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average approach to amplify-and-forward relay networks","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5D5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0562S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5341119,"authors":[{"name":"Savitri Galih","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Savitri","lastName":"Galih","id":"37680656900"},{"name":"Riafeni Karlina","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Riafeni","lastName":"Karlina","id":"37680656600"},{"name":"Fifin Nugroho","affiliation":["Versatile Silicon, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fifin","lastName":"Nugroho","id":"37680655700"},{"name":"Ade Irawan","affiliation":["Versatile Silicon, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ade","lastName":"Irawan","id":"37680655400"},{"name":"Trio Adiono","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Trio","lastName":"Adiono","id":"37370695100"},{"name":"Adit Kurniawan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Informatics, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adit","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37393324400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341119","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Downlink","Interpolation","WiMAX","Frequency estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Informatics","Dispersion","OFDM","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","dispersive channels","frequency division multiple access","interpolation","least mean squares methods","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","time-frequency analysis","time-varying channels","transfer functions","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility communication system","data symbol based channel estimation method","MMSE interpolation","time variation channel","downlink OFDMA mobile WiMAX","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","channel transfer function","linear interpolation scheme","time domain analysis","frequency domain analysis","dispersive channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDMA","mobile WiMAX"]}],"abstract":"High mobility communication systems need suitable channel estimation to cope high frequency selectivity and time variation channel. In recent study on downlink OFDMA mobile WiMAX, channel estimation was done by exploiting pilot from preamble instead of pilot from data symbol due to ununiformly pilot spacing in this standard. In this paper we propose to obtain channel transfer function by exploiting pilot at data symbol. We try two interpolation scheme for this data symbol based channel estimation. First is two dimensional MMSE/linear interpolation scheme. Linear interpolation was carried out at time domain and MMSE interpolation was performed at frequency domain. The other is linear interpolation for both dimension/domain. Based on our simulation, it is proven that the data symbol based channel estimation method have better performance compare with preamble based channel estimation method. It is also shown that the MMSE interpolation at frequency domain achieve better performance at highly dispersive channel (ITU-B vehicular).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High mobility data symbol based channel estimation for Downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e standard","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341119","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341119.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"High mobility data symbol based channel estimation for Downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e standard","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341119/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999935","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High mobility data symbol based channel estimation for Downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e standard","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043953S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341120,"authors":[{"name":"Myung Jun Shim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung Jun","lastName":"Shim","id":"37665302000"},{"name":"Jung Su Han","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Su","lastName":"Han","id":"37402417800"},{"name":"Hee Jin Roh","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hee Jin","lastName":"Roh","id":"37619272000"},{"name":"Hyung Jin Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290851000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341120","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency estimation","Long Term Evolution","Frequency conversion","Tracking loops","Performance loss","Degradation","Fading","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization method","3GPP LTE OFDMA system","TDD mode","3rd generation partnership project","long term evolution","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","time division duplexing","primary synchronization signal correlation","cyclic prefix correlation","fading channel","SNR loss","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a coarse and fine frequency synchronization method which is suitable for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system in time division duplexing (TDD) mode. In general, primary synchronization signal (PSS) correlation based estimation method and cyclic prefix (CP) correlation based tracking loop are applied for coarse and fine frequency synchronization in 3GPP LTE OFDMA system, respectively. However, the conventional coarse frequency synchronization method has performance degradation caused by fading channel and signal to noise ratio (SNR) loss. Also, the conventional fine frequency synchronization method cannot guarantee stable operation in TDD mode because there is no signal in uplink subframe. Therefore, in this paper, we propose enhanced coarse and fine frequency synchronization methods which can estimate more accurately in low SNR and high speed channel environments and has stable operation for TDD frame structure, respectively. By computer simulation, we show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional methods, and verify that the proposed frequency synchronization method can guarantee stable operation in 3GPP LTE OFDMA system in TDD mode.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341120","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","startPage":"864","endPage":"868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency synchronization method for 3GPP LTE OFDMA system in TDD mode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A frequency synchronization method for 3GPP LTE OFDMA system in TDD mode","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341120/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999936","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency synchronization method for 3GPP LTE OFDMA system in TDD mode","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043581S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5341121,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeseong Kim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jaeseong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37678155900"},{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37270680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341121","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Design methodology","Power dissipation","Interleaved codes","Frequency modulation","Modulation coding","OFDM","Wireless communication","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable wordlength","Viterbi decoder","BICM-OFDM systems","bit-interleaved coded modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading environments"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new design method for reducing power dissipation of Viterbi decoder using variable wordlength architectures in wireless bit-interleaved coded modulation and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BICMOFDM) systems.

We consider that the relay and the base station are equipped with 2 antennas and the user terminal has a single antenna. Two types of relay protocols are accounted for: equalize-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Signals expressions are derived and the bit error rates obtained for a practical and preeminent scenario, with LTE parameters and using convolutional channel coding. The performance of the proposed relay-assisted scheme is evaluated under realistic scenarios, considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on LTE specifications. Results are compared to those of other relay-assisted design approaches that have been recently proposed for the case of 1-antenna relay and the non-cooperative systems. For this comparison, we implement three propagation scenarios, with different SNR transmission conditions among links. Simulation results show that the availability of a bi-antenna array at the relay significantly improves the cooperative system performance, but improvements are highly dependent on the scenarios and relay protocol as well as of the cooperative second-hop quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed space-frequency block coding for a 2-antenna relay in downlink OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341122","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341122.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed space-frequency block coding for a 2-antenna relay in downlink OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341122/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed space-frequency block coding for a 2-antenna relay in downlink OFDM systems","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052807S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341128,"authors":[{"name":"Bub-Joo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Kyongju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bub-Joo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37068603600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341128","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":928},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Working environment noise","Uncertainty","Interference","Databases","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Noise generators","FCC","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","digital television","frequency allocation","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing function","cognitive radio network","CR network","opportunistic unlicensed spectrum access","radio interference","real-time radio environment","incumbent user spectrum band","beacon signal","geo-location database access","regulatory requirement","DTV detection threshold","spectrum sensing time","spectrum sensing complexity","spectrum allocation method"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing issues in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","endPage":"828","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341128","startPage":"824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341128","abstract":"This paper investigates the spectrum sensing issues in the cognitive radio (CR) networks of opportunistic unlicensed spectrum access.

Also, this paper introduces design trade-offs in order to optimize the sensing parameters such as sensing time and sensing complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999944","htmlLink":"/document/5341128/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing issues in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing issues in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3J3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060714S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5341130,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Hirata","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Hirata","id":"37400133800"},{"name":"Masateru Matsuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masateru","lastName":"Matsuo","id":"37665240500"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Wahyul Amien Syafei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Wahyul Amien","lastName":"Syafei","id":"37394519800"},{"name":"Baiko Sai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Baiko","lastName":"Sai","id":"37410140100"},{"name":"Yoshimitsu Kuroki","affiliation":["Department of Social Information System Engineering, Kurume National College of Technology, Kurume, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshimitsu","lastName":"Kuroki","id":"37407583800"},{"name":"Akio Miyazaki","affiliation":["Department of Social Information System, Kyushu Sangyo University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37326643400"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341130","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a 4 K digital cinema transmission over 1.2 Gbps wireless LAN system.

To this end, we derive explicit formulas for the condition numbers of the filtering matrices and the post-processing SNRs. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the improvement achieved by the MMSE detector over the ZF detector is not only dependent on the noise variance and the condition number of the channel matrix, but also on how close the smallest singular values are to the noise variance.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341137","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341137.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the achievable improvement by the linear minimum mean square error detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341137/","displayDocTitle":"On the achievable improvement by the linear minimum mean square error detector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999860","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341137/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the achievable improvement by the linear minimum mean square error detector","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3H3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090757S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5341156,"authors":[{"name":"Pranithan Phensadsaeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pranithan","lastName":"Phensadsaeng","id":"37680641800"},{"name":"Werapon Chiracharit","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Werapon","lastName":"Chiracharit","id":"37426758000"},{"name":"Kosin Chamnongthai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kosin","lastName":"Chamnongthai","id":"37269457800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341156","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341156","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Cardiac disease","Field programmable gate arrays","Cardiovascular diseases","Cardiac arrest","Lungs","Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Computer vision","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","decision support systems","image resolution","medical image processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","color model-based tonsillitis detection","input image","computation box","normal tonsillitis disease image","decision support system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VLSI","VHDL","Medical Image","Tonsillitis Disease"]}],"abstract":"Tonsillitis disease is the cause of heart attack and pneumonia.

In MC-CDMA based cognitive radio, deactiving some subcarriers to avoid interference with primary users, causes the loss of orthogonality among the spreading codes and therefore the performance of the system reduces. On the other hand, different structures which are proposed for equalizer in traditional MC-CDMA receiver cause many problems. For example MRC and EGC cause the loss of orthogonality among the users' signals; ZF introduces noise amplification and MMSE increases receiver's complexity. In this paper a new structure for NC-MC-CDMA system is introduced which solves the spreading codes' problem. Furthermore, it will be shown that this structure reduces receiver complexity by removing equalizer. The performance of the new structure is investigated theoretically and simulation results evaluate the performance of the system. As it will be shown, by removing the ISI with this new structure, system's performance in fading channel is similar to AWGN channel that is prominent progress in respect of traditional MC-CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341164","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341164.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new structure for NC-MC-CDMA in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341164/","displayDocTitle":"A new structure for NC-MC-CDMA in cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999887","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341164/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new structure for NC-MC-CDMA in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3D2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045443S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341165,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shaifur Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Shaifur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37834959000"},{"name":"Youngil Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngil","lastName":"Park","id":"37281315800"},{"name":"Ki-Doo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Doo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292677000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341165","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":908},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Synchronization","Costs","Hardware","Global Positioning System","Electronic mail","Routing","Radio communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","radiowave propagation","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network routing","location estimation","location-aware service","received signal strength","propagation-loss model","wireless channel","artificial neural network","grid sensor training phase","low-cost WSN device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341165","abstract":"In wireless sensor networks (WSN), location estimation is important for routing efficiency and location-aware services. Traditional received signal strength based localizations using propagation-loss model are often erroneous for the low-cost WSN devices. The reason is that the wireless channel is vulnerable to so many factors that deriving the appropriate propagation-loss model for the low cost WSN devices is not possible. Hence, we propose a flexible model based on neural network and grid sensor training phase for accurate localization of sensors. Simulation results show that the location accuracy can be increased by increasing the grid sensor density and the number of access points.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341165","startPage":"639","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341165.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of Wireless Sensor Network using artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341165/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Localization of Wireless Sensor Network using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341165/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10999888","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of Wireless Sensor Network using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3C5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078248S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5341171,"authors":[{"name":"Young Jin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185547400"},{"name":"Hyon Soo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyon Soo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37676724300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341171","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Concurrent computing","Pipelines","Frequency","Signal processing","Image processing","Data engineering","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","image processing","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D FFT","multiple topology","4 X 4 Torus","Xilinx Virtex-IV device","maximum system frequency","chip area","image size","fast Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed 2D FFT for 8times8 matrix without transpose of data by using multiple topology on 4times4 Torus.

This maximizes a frequency diversity effect and also enhances a multi-user diversity effect.

A multi-device system is a good example of a rank deficient system because the total number of transmit antennas are greater than the number of receive antennas. The detection problem is known to be NP-Hard. Exhaustive search for finding an optimal detection (maximum likelihood (ML) detection) has a computational complexity that increases exponentially with the number of mobile devices, transmit antennas per mobile device, and the number of bits per symbols. We apply estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to detecting symbols in a rank-deficient MD-STBC-MIMO system. The proposed EDA detector finds a nearly optimal solution in real time and also requires very low amount of computation as compared to the ML (exhaustive search) and sphere decoder (SD).

However when PB/MC-CDMA used in MIMO system there still have the interference occurred by the multiple access interference (MAI) and because of the correlation between the antennas there also has the interference from different antennas.

When the two technical combine together, then good performance can be get in MIMO Rayleigh fading system.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341180","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341180.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of PB/MC-CDMA in MIMO Rayleigh fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341180/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of PB/MC-CDMA in MIMO Rayleigh fading channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999903","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341180/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of PB/MC-CDMA in MIMO Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045926S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341181,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Seok Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Seok","lastName":"Han","id":"37532226100"},{"name":"Jaehoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341181","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mobile antennas","Next generation networking","Mobile handsets","Couplings","Mobile computing","Application software","Antenna measurements","Telephone sets","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","mobile communication","monopole antennas","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna","decoupling network","next generation mobile application","parallel folded monopole antenna","isolation characteristics","transmission line","shunt reactive component","quarter-wavelength jointed shorting structure","distance 100 mm","distance 6 mm"]}],"abstract":"A compact MIMO antenna using a decoupling network for next generation mobile application is proposed.

However, the employment of such detectors is restricted by two factors; the ill-conditioning of the SEFDM projections matrix in the system linear statistical model and the sensitivity of the SD complexity to noise. A solution to the latter could be given by a fixed complexity detection based on the Semidefinite Programming (SDP). Notwithstanding, SDP error performance appears to be suboptimal. In order to diminish the error performance gap between the SDP and the optimal detector we propose a modified SD that investigates only the points of the SEFDM lattice within a hypersphere whose size is determined by a first SDP estimate. In addition, the new SD tree is pruned to include only the branches that have a heuristically predefined Hamming distance from the SDP estimate. We show that the introduced scheme achieves a quasi optimal Bit Error Rate (BER) for an SEFDM scheme with 20% spectral gain compared to Orthogonal FDM (OFDM). Moreover, we demonstrate by simulation that the new scheme is superior in terms of computational effort compared to an equivalent SDP brute force Maximum Likelihood (ML) scheme. Finally, it is shown that the new pruned SD reduces by more than 30% the number of the visits to the nodes of the SD tree made by the conventional SD using the Schnorr Euchner (SE) reordering strategy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341206","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341206.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"465","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new quasi-optimal detection algorithm for a non orthogonal Spectrally Efficient FDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new quasi-optimal detection algorithm for a non orthogonal Spectrally Efficient FDM","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341206/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999975","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new quasi-optimal detection algorithm for a non orthogonal Spectrally Efficient FDM","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"2F2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064862S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5341209,"authors":[{"name":"Wassamon Phusakulkajorn","affiliation":["Advanced Virtual and Intelligent Computing Center (AVIC), Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wassamon","lastName":"Phusakulkajorn","id":"37680591100"},{"name":"Chidchanok Lursinsap","affiliation":["Advanced Virtual and Intelligent Computing Center (AVIC), Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chidchanok","lastName":"Lursinsap","id":"37295359500"},{"name":"Jack Asavanant","affiliation":["Advanced Virtual and Intelligent Computing Center, Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Asavanant","id":"37421663700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341209","abstract":"Rainfall prediction generally requires reliable hydrological models as well as relevant information of meteorological and geographical data. In this paper, a model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and wavelet decomposition is proposed as a learning tool to predict consecutive daily rainfalls on accounts of the preceding events of rainfall data. Two sets of wavelet coefficients, for which one pattern represents detail information of rainfall data and the other acts as a smoothing filter, are extracted for the ANNs. A back-propagation neural network is used in the learning and knowledge extraction processes. The methodology is tested on rainfall data from five stations in the south of Thailand: tha Sae district in Chumphon province, Kanchanadit district in Surat Thani province, Muang district in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Muang district in Phatthalung province and Hatyai district in Songkhla province. From the past historical records of Thai Meteorological Department and Royal Irrigation Department, these study areas are vulnerable to heavy rainfall distribution and flood disaster.

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can provide performance enhancement over the SNR-based scheme in spatially-correlated channel environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341231.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation of transmit power in Spatially-correlated dual-hop MIMO relay channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Power system relaying","Channel capacity","Bit error rate","Power system modeling","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless cellular systems","Propagation losses","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","correlation methods","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit power allocation","spatially-correlated dual-hop MIMO relay channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output communication","power constraint","average signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","upper-bound analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel correlation","MIMO relay channel","transmit power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of transmit power in Spatially-correlated dual-hop MIMO relay channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000029","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of transmit power in Spatially-correlated dual-hop MIMO relay channels","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"2A5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158081S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341232,"authors":[{"name":"Dongmei Jiang","affiliation":["Wireless Mobile Communication and Transmission (WMCT) Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Dongmei Jiang","id":"37087254675"},{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Mobile Communication and Transmission (WMCT) Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Haixia Zhang","id":"37087220559"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["Wireless Mobile Communication and Transmission (WMCT) Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Dongfeng Yuan","id":"37087192172"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341232","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear precoding with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO relay networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the system performance of a downlink transmission with fixed relay, where the signals at transmit and relay nodes are pre-processed by linear precoders designed based only on partial channel state information (CSI) obtained from the limited feedback channel. Precoders are designed to minimize the mean square error of the transmit signal under the constraint of total transmit power at source and relay nodes. We assume that there is no direct link between source node and users, all the signal are delivered to user ends with the help of the relay node. Signal model for the described system is derived in details and the system performance is investigated. Performance gain brought by precoding is analyzed as well by comparing the uncoded bit error rate (BER) performance of system with precoding and that of system without precoding. Employing precoders based on limited CSI can still improve the BER performance significantly. The system model derived in this paper hereby can be a reference for applications in similar scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341232","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","startPage":"337","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341232.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Power system relaying","Bit error rate","System performance","Signal design","Downlink","Channel state information","State feedback","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","least mean squares methods","linear codes","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoding","multiuser MIMO relay network","downlink transmission system","partial channel state information","limited feedback channel","minimum mean square error","transmit signal","BER performance","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linear precoding with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341232/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341232/","accessionNumber":"11000030","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear precoding with limited feedback in multiuser MIMO relay networks","confLoc":"Icheon","sourcePdf":"2A6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044812S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5341235,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Lu","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"lastName":"Zhen Lu","id":"37673531900"},{"name":"Anthony Kadi","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Kadi","id":"37680381900"},{"name":"Tim Aubrey","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Aubrey","id":"37352012200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341235","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"A channel estimation approach yielding both channel gains and the number of multi-paths is presented.

The CME based estimator is shown to be viable in both fixed and mobile broadband MIMO-OFDM wireless applications, and takes advantage of determining the nonzero taps as well. The performance of the approach is compared to the popular minimum description length (MDL) algorithm for estimation of the number of channel paths, by means of simulation in the context of a 2times2 MIMO-OFDM transceiver system.

hardware architecture without memory fabrication for mobile process. Previous CAVLD hardware architecture consists of five step blocks and each block gets several bits from controller and Look-Up Tables (LUTs). Many researches on LUTs basically require Read Only Memory (ROM) or Random Access Memory (RAM) fabrication process which is difficult to be implemented in general mobile digital logic fabrication process. In this reason, the hardware architecture for CAVLD inevitably has large hardware area and high power consumption. This paper propose two techniques, which combines five steps into four steps and optimizes LUTs without embedded memory for reducing chip size. By adopting these two techniques, the memory size is reduced 15% and the processing time is reduced 33% compared with previous architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341257","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341257.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The new memory-efficient hardware architecture of CAVLD in H.264/AVC for mobile system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The new memory-efficient hardware architecture of CAVLD in H.264/AVC for mobile system","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341257/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000055","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341257/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The new memory-efficient hardware architecture of CAVLD in H.264/AVC for mobile system","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1G5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063406S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341260,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-In Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-In","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407297100"},{"name":"Jung-Su Han","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Su","lastName":"Han","id":"37402417800"},{"name":"Hee-Jin Roh","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hee-Jin","lastName":"Roh","id":"37619272000"},{"name":"Hyung-Jin Choi","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290851000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341260","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":2114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","Degradation","Detection algorithms","Downlink","Frequency response","OFDM","Time division multiplexing","Gas detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","correlation methods","signal detection","synchronisation","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSS detection method","initial cell search","3GPP LTE FDD dual mode receiver","TDD dual mode receiver","long term evolution","primary synchronization signal","PSS","secondary synchronization signal","channel frequency response","CFR","performance degradation","time division duplex","partial correlation","differential correlation","cyclic-prefix detection algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341260","abstract":"In 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) system, initial cell search procedure comprises two steps using primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS).

We stress on the latter part. Dual visual watermarks are original image watermark which is color scale image the same as original image and ownership watermark which is gray scale image, respectively. Both of them are embedded into original image using DWT-SVD to prove robustness. For recovery signal embedding, luminance signal and chrominance signal of original image were embedded into surplus chrominance space of original image using matrix transpose replacement embedding method. For watermark extraction scheme: firstly, threshold value would be set to find tampered region. Then we extract the recovery signals to construct recovery information. Lastly we replace tampered regions with recovery information based on threshold value. We can extract the original image watermark and ownership watermark from recovery image. Experiment demonstrates that the proposed scheme is robust to a wide range of attacks and is good at tampered detection as well as self-recovery of tampered images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341268","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341268.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tamper detection and self-recovery algorithm of color image based on robust embedding of dual visual watermarks using DWT-SVD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tamper detection and self-recovery algorithm of color image based on robust embedding of dual visual watermarks using DWT-SVD","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000066","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tamper detection and self-recovery algorithm of color image based on robust embedding of dual visual watermarks using DWT-SVD","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1F2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038619S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5341269,"authors":[{"name":"Kwanghee Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwanghee","lastName":"Park","id":"37678103300"},{"name":"Dong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37677369900"},{"name":"Youngjoo Woo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngjoo","lastName":"Woo","id":"37671737000"},{"name":"Geunhyung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Geunhyung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37678574300"},{"name":"Ju-Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju-Hong","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185800900"},{"name":"Deok-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deok-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37598065400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341269","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":1337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hard disks","Consumer electronics","Reliability engineering","Solid state circuits","Electric shock","Interference","Adaptive arrays","Manufacturing","Read-write memory","Drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","error statistics","flash memories","RAID","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSD array storage system reliability","RAID mechanism","solid state drive","NAND flash memory chip","consumer electronics market","bit error rate","trace-driven simulation","I/O performance"]}],"abstract":"Recently solid state drive (SSD) based on NAND flash memory chips becomes popular in the consumer electronics market because it is tough on shock and its I/O performance is better than that of conventional hard disk drive. However, as the density of the semiconductor grows higher, the distance between its wires narrows down, their interferences are frequently occurred, and the bit error rate of semiconductor increases. Such frequent error occurrence and short life cycle in NAND flash memory reduce the reliability of SSD. In this paper, we present reliability and performance enhancement technique on new RAID system based on SSD. First, we analyze the existing RAID mechanism in the environment of SSD array and then develop a new RAID methodology adaptable to SSD array storage system. Via trace-driven simulation, we evaluated the performance of our new optimized SSD array storage using RAID mechanism. The proposed method enhances the reliability of SSD array 2% higher than that of existing RAID system and improves the I/O performance of SSD array 28% higher than that of existing RAID system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability and performance enhancement technique for SSD array storage system using RAID mechanism","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341269","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341269.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reliability and performance enhancement technique for SSD array storage system using RAID mechanism","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341269/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000067","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability and performance enhancement technique for SSD array storage system using RAID mechanism","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1E5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03998S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5341275,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxia Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoxia Song","id":"37531318400"},{"name":"Bin Shen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","UWB ITRC, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bin Shen","id":"37394691600"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB ITRC, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341275","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Routing protocols","Delay","Cost function","Chromium","Frequency","Intelligent networks","Wireless networks","Communication system control","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","routing protocols","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant routing algorithm","cognitive radio network","CRN","dynamic spectrum sharing","frequency band","routing protocol","swarm intelligence","routing cost function","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio network","Routing","Ant colony algorthim"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved ant routing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341275.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341275","startPage":"110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341275","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is a revolution in radio technology. Cognitive radio networks (CRN) is featured by the dynamic spectrum sharing of the secondary nodes coexisting with the primary nodes. Secondary nodes in cognitive radio networks (CRN) need the ability to work on different frequency bands and intelligently adjust their configuration to changes in the communication environment. It is a complicated and challenge task. So the routing protocol of CRN is different from that of traditional wireless network. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol which does not need common control channel in CRN. This scheme applies swarm intelligence into CRN routing protocol. It can find out the route , which has minimum delay from source to destination , utilizing a routing cost function. The cost function takes into account many kinds of delay simultaneously. Simulation result shows that the proposed routing algorithm can effectively reduce the cumulate delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999999","htmlLink":"/document/5341275/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved ant routing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved ant routing algorithm in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1D5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077607S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5341277,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Yao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haipeng Yao","id":"37530486300"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Luyong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Luyong Zhang","id":"37292620200"},{"name":"He Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"He Liu","id":"37675893700"},{"name":"Liang Tang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liang Tang","id":"37591636600"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB ITRC, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung Sup","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37280638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341277","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","Wireless communication","Throughput","Chromium","Helium","Wireless networks","Electronic mail","Statistics","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation scheme","joint spectrum overlay network","underlay cognitive radio network","spectrum sharing strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing strategy","cognitive radio","interference constrains","optimal power allocation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient power allocation scheme in joint spectrum overlay and underlay cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341277","startPage":"102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341277","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an efficient power allocation scheme that aims at maximizing the system throughput in joint spectrum overlay and underlay cognitive radio network.

The currently available unlicensed spectrum is reaching its limit and various demands for applications and data rates in wireless communications requires additional spectrum which imposes limits on spectrum access. These requirements demand for efficient and intelligent use of spectrum. The system model and the problem of the optimum spectrum allocation in cognitive radios are introduced and formulated. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), cognitive radios are defined as radio systems that continuously perform spectrum sensing, dynamically identify unused spectrum, and then operate in those spectrum holes where the licensed (primary) radio systems are idle.

The results of computer simulation show the improvement of system capacity in Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341297","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5331933/5340966/05341297.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multi-user MIMO OFDM channel estimation with LS and MMSE for 802.11n systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341297/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multi-user MIMO OFDM channel estimation with LS and MMSE for 802.11n systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000021","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341297/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multi-user MIMO OFDM channel estimation with LS and MMSE for 802.11n systems","confLoc":"Icheon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"1A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052542S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5331933","isNumber":"5340966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5331933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5340966","articleId":"5341297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5341298,"authors":[{"name":"Donghun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Donghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406585200"},{"name":"Saeid Nooshabadi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Nooshabadi","id":"37281345100"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiseon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4521-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341298","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Multiuser detection","Diversity reception","Adaptive arrays","Analytical models","Quality of service","Receiving antennas","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser diversity","transmit antenna subset selection","MIMO system","space-time block coding","outage probability","Tx-AnSS","single input single output system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents performance analysis of STBC scheme with multi-user diversity (MUD) and transmit (TX) antenna subset selection (AnSS) where the user and the antenna subset are adaptively selected in MIMO systems. We derive an analytical expression for the average effective SNR and outage probability, showing that STBC scheme with MUD and Tx-AnSS provides full diversity. We also derive analytical expressions for the STBC scheme with only MUD. Analytical results show that the STBC scheme with MUD and Tx-AnSS obtains an effective SNR gain, while the STBC scheme with only MUD shows a SNR loss over SISO (Single Input Single Output) system. Thus the STBC scheme combining MUD and Tx-AnSS keeps their own benefits and provides outage probability improvement without additional burdens in contrary to the STBC scheme with only MUD.

Our analysis suggests that pseudo-random sticking and unsticking of the SDRAM bits is due to thermally induced fluctuations in leakage current through displacement damage complexes in depletion regions that were created by high-energy neutron and proton interactions. It is shown that the number of observed stuck bits increases exponentially with temperature, due to the general increase in the leakage currents through the damage centers with temperature. Nevertheless, some stuck bits are seen to pseudo-randomly stick and unstick in the context of a continuously rising trend of temperature, thus demonstrating that their damage centers can exist in multiple widely spaced, discrete levels of leakage current, which is highly consistent with RTS. This implies that these intermittently stuck bits (ISBs) are a displacement damage phenomenon and are unrelated to microdose issues, which is confirmed by the observation that they also occur in unbiased irradiation. Finally, we note that observed variations in the periodicity of the sticking and unsticking behavior on several timescales is most readily explained by multiple leakage current pathways through displacement damage complexes spontaneously and independently opening and closing under the influence of thermal vibrations.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2032184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2032184","startPage":"3057","endPage":"3064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5341340/05341348.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Random Telegraph Signal Behavior of Intermittently Stuck Bits in SDRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Random Telegraph Signal Behavior of Intermittently Stuck Bits in SDRAMs","volume":"56","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11019278","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5341348/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Random Telegraph Signal Behavior of Intermittently Stuck Bits in SDRAMs","sourcePdf":"tns-chugg-2032184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063309S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5341340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5341340","articleId":"5341348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5341353,"authors":[{"name":"David F.

The MBU data show the importance of acquiring and analyzing the data with respect to the location of the multiple-bit upsets since the relative location of the cells is important in determining which MBU upsets can be corrected with error correcting code (ECC) circuits.

We demonstrate that, for a fixed incident particle linear energy transfer (LET), increasing particle energy beyond a certain point causes a decrease in nuclear reaction-induced charge collection. This suggests that a worst-case energy exists for single-event effect (SEE) susceptibility, which depends on the technology, device layout, and the incident ions' fixed LET value. A Monte Carlo approach for identifying the worst-case energy is applied to certain bulk-Si and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies. Simulation results suggest that the decrease in charge collection beyond the worst-case energy occurs because the secondary particles produced from the high-energy nuclear reactions have less mass and higher energy and are therefore less ionizing than those produced by lower-energy reactions.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2034160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5341340/05341385.pdf","startPage":"3172","endPage":"3179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2034160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charge Generation by Secondary Particles From Nuclear Reactions in BEOL Materials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341385/","displayDocTitle":"Charge Generation by Secondary Particles From Nuclear Reactions in BEOL Materials","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11019231","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341385/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge Generation by Secondary Particles From Nuclear Reactions in BEOL Materials","sourcePdf":"tns-ndodds-2034160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086346S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5341340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5341340","articleId":"5341385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5341386,"authors":[{"name":"O.

A reliability model is presented for estimating the MTTF of SRAM FPGA designs in specific orbits and orbit conditions. The model requires orbit- and condition-specific SEU rates and design-specific estimates of the probability of failure during a single scrubbing period. Probability of failure estimates are reported for several FPGA designs from both fault-injection and accelerator experiments. The model also includes a method for estimating composite mean time to failure (MTTF) that incorporates all orbit conditions over a solar cycle. Despite using pessimistic assumptions, the results from this model suggest that SRAM FPGA designs protected by TMR and scrubbing operate very reliably in a LEO orbit and surprisingly well in \u00bfharsh\u00bf orbits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341388/","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5341388/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11019230","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SRAM FPGA Reliability Analysis for Harsh Radiation Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM FPGA Reliability Analysis for Harsh Radiation Environments","sourcePdf":"tns-mwirthlin-2033381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104301S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5341340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5341340","articleId":"5341388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5341398,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These damage modes include single-event dielectric rupture (SEDR), long-term reliability degradation (LTRD), and radiation-induced soft breakdown (RISB), and they play a major role in limiting device lifetime and reliability in space applications. The LET-induced transient carrier plasma that is generated along the incident ion path has traditionally been understood as the physical effect ultimately leading to damage in dielectric layers. However, in a recent study we showed that nontrivial densities of atomic displacements are directly generated by incident heavy ions. Here, we report multiscale calculations of the effects of ion-induced atomic displacements on the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n layers.

To determine the effectiveness of a transistor-layout-based radiation hardened by design (RHBD) technique with respect to immunity to SETs at the circuit level, the BGR circuit implemented with HBTs surrounded by an alternate reverse-biased \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pn</i>\n junction (n-ring RHBD) is also bombarded with oxygen ions, and subsequent SETs are captured. Experimental results indicate that the number of events causing transients with peak magnitude more than 5% above the dc level have been reduced in the RHBD version; however, with the inclusion of the n-ring RHBD, new locations for the occurrence of transients (albeit with smaller peak magnitude) are created. Transients at the transistor-level are also independently captured and are presented. It is demonstrated that while the transients are short at the transistor level (ns duration), relatively long transients are obtained at the circuit level (hundreds of nanoseconds). In addition, the impact of the SET response of the BGR on the performance of an ultra-high-speed 3-bit SiGe analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is investigated through simulation. It is shown that ion-induced transients in the reference voltage could eventually lead to data corruption at the output of the ADC.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2034159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5341340/05341405.pdf","startPage":"3469","endPage":"3476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2034159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Transient Response of SiGe Voltage References and Its Impact on the Performance of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits","volume":"56","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341405/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11019214","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341405/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Transient Response of SiGe Voltage References and Its Impact on the Performance of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits","sourcePdf":"tns-najafizadeh-2034159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10282S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5341340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5341340","articleId":"5341405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5341413,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey S.

The discharge of a single microcell is relatively well understood and electronic models exist to simulate this process. In this paper we introduce an extended model that is able to simulate the simultaneous discharge of multiple cells. This model is used to predict the SiPM signal in response to fast light pulses as a function of the number of fired cells, taking into account the influence of the input impedance of the SiPM preamplifier. The model predicts that the electronic signal is not proportional to the number of fired cells if the preamplifier input impedance is not zero. This effect becomes more important for SiPMs with lower parasitic capacitance (which otherwise is a favorable property). The model is validated by comparing its predictions to experimental data obtained with two different SiPMs (Hamamatsu S10362-11-25u and Hamamatsu S10362-33-25c) illuminated with ps laser pulses. The experimental results are in good agreement with the model predictions.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2030728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5341423/05341428.pdf","startPage":"3726","endPage":"3733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2030728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of Silicon Photomultiplier Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341428/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Silicon Photomultiplier Signals","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11019300","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Silicon Photomultiplier Signals","sourcePdf":"tns-sseifert-2030728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0767S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5341423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"81","articleId":"5341428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5341432,"authors":[{"name":"Shah M.

We study here a real-time capability of the event-by-event correction method, which at the core translates to solving many sets of linear equations. Tight time limits and constrained front-end electronics resources make well-known direct solvers inappropriate. We propose a novel approach based on the Gauss-Seidel iterative method, which turns out to be a stable and cost-efficient solution to improve spectroscopic resolution in the front-end electronics. We show the method convergence properties for a class of matrices that emerge in calorimetric processing of scintillation detector signals and demonstrate the ability of the method to support the relevant resolutions. The sole iteration-based error component can be brought below the sliding window induced errors in a reasonable number of iteration steps, thus allowing real-time operation. An area-efficient hardware implementation is proposed that fully utilizes the method's inherent parallelism. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341434/","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5341434/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11019294","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method as a Real-Time Pile-Up Solver of Scintillation Pulses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method as a Real-Time Pile-Up Solver of Scintillation Pulses","sourcePdf":"tns-rnovak-2030725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079813S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5341423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5341423","articleId":"5341434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5341523,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37676947000"},{"name":"Xiao-Su Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Su","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596822900"},{"name":"Bing Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37668429400"},{"name":"Hong-Wei Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37401004400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341523","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Computer crime","Embedded computing","Computer networks","Protocols","Computer worms","Statistics","Digital forensics","Large-scale systems","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","matrix algebra","security of data","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","anomaly analysis method","network traffic","correlation coefficient matrix","TCP protocol","multivariate correlation analysis","TCP packets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network anomaly","TCP flow","correlation coefficient matrix","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Based on TCP protocol, this paper aims at TCP flows, discusses the effects of multivariate correlation analysis on network traffic, obtains the quantitative relationship between different types of TCP packets in each time unit by correlation coefficient matrix, and finally proposes an anomaly detection and analysis method based on the correlation coefficient matrix.

The collection of the necessary information on every packet becomes prohibitive in term of the consumption of resources by measurement operation in high speed links. Packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure flow data on high-speed links. Passive traffic measurement increasingly employs sampling at the packet level and makes inferences from sampled network traffic. However, previous work has shown the inaccuracy of estimating flow length distributions from sampled traffic when the sampling is performed at the packet level. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm (HA) that uses flow statistics formed from double-sampled packet stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of flows in the unsampled stream. The theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of this method is well under control, and the experiment results demonstrate the inferred distributions are accurate.","doi":"10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.39","startPage":"173","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341509/5341510/05341558.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341558/","accessionNumber":"10999191","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341558/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Flow Length Distributions from Double-Sampled Flow Statistics","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3825a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051185S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341509","isNumber":"5341510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5341510","articleId":"5341558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5341564,"authors":[{"name":"Menghui Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Resource Management, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Menghui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37673747600"},{"name":"Tonghong Li","affiliation":["Facultad de Informtica, Universidad Politcnica, De Madrid, Spain","Facultad de Informtica, Universidad Politcnica, De Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Tonghong","lastName":"Li","id":"37539280800"},{"name":"Weikang Yang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weikang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37402759900"},{"name":"Xin Su","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Su","id":"37329334500"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341564","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"abstract":"Channel estimation is a key issue in time domain synchronous-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) system, which is usually based on pseudorandom noise (PN) sequences time domain correlation. However, in space time block coding (STBC)-based TDS-OFDM MIMO system, PN sequences received in each receiver antenna are the overlaps of multiple transmitters' linear convolution of PN sequences with corresponding channel responses. Thus, channel state information (CSI) can not be estimated accurately only by means of PN sequences time domain correlation. In this paper we propose a joint time-frequency domain channel estimation scheme for STBC-based TDS-OFDM MIMO system with 2 transmitter antennas and 2 receiver antennas. To aid the channel estimation, every two signal frames in a super frame are grouped into a signal frame group at the transmitter side. For the first frame of each signal frame group, 315 Transmission Parameters Signaling (TPS) symbols are inserted equally with 12 OFDM sub-carries intervals in both transmitter branches. While for the second frame, TPS symbols are inserted equally only in the first transmitter branch, and in the second transmitter branch zero symbols are inserted in the corresponding positions. By exploiting such an elaborate TPS inserting rule and PN sequence time domain correlation, our proposed scheme can estimate CSI easily in both time domain and frequency domain. Simulation results show that our scheme can estimate the CSI accurately: the mean absolute error between the estimated values and the original values is less than 0.01 under slow-fading channel when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 8 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341509/5341510/05341564.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","doi":"10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Channel Estimation Scheme for STBC-Based TDS-OFDM MIMO System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Frequency division multiplexing","Block codes","Convolution","Channel state information","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation scheme","STBC-based TDS-OFDM MIMO system","time domain synchronous-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","pseudorandom noise sequences","space time block coding","channel state information","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","transmission parameters signaling symbols","slow-fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time domain synchronous - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM)","channel estimation","MIMO","space time block coding","time domain correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Channel Estimation Scheme for STBC-Based TDS-OFDM MIMO System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999193","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Channel Estimation Scheme for STBC-Based TDS-OFDM MIMO System","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3825a160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071173S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341509","isNumber":"5341510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5341510","articleId":"5341564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341600,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Shang","id":"37667674500"},{"name":"Chen Kai","affiliation":["School of Information Security Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Kai","id":"37089115714"},{"name":"Haibing Guan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Haibing","lastName":"Guan","id":"37408832600"},{"name":"Alei Liang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Alei","lastName":"Liang","id":"37408551100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341600","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Robot kinematics","Embedded computing","Large-scale systems","Robustness","Cost function","Processor scheduling","Hardware","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-robot systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","map-coverage algorithm","multirobot technology","coverage process","virtual pheromone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["map-construction","multi-robots","Swarm Intelligence","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341600","abstract":"With the development of multi-robots technology, with multi-robots, large scale swarms are often applied to improve the efficiency and robustness of coverage process. The traditional methods basing on negotiation and task allocation often meet their bottleneck in this scenario of large scale swarm task for the dramatic increase of communication and computation. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm basing on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) model. In this algorithm, a virtual pheromone based communication mechanism is adopted to decrease the communication cost and optimize the cooperation between nodes. For the nodes, there are two phases, exploration and exploitation, with different indicators in the PSO model. By switching between these two phases, the swarm completes the task of map coverage. A series of experiments on simulator is carried out and proves the convergence and excellent scalability of our algorithm. By optimizing some parameter in the PSO model with the simulator, the efficiency of map-coverage is further improved.","doi":"10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.26","startPage":"87","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341510","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341509/5341510/05341600.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Map-Coverage Algorithm Basing on Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341600/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Map-Coverage Algorithm Basing on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341600/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10999220","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Map-Coverage Algorithm Basing on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3825a087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055873S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341509","isNumber":"5341510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341509","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5341510","articleId":"5341600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5341653,"authors":[{"name":"He Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Guo","id":"37276730300"},{"name":"Lili Su","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Su","id":"37666644000"},{"name":"Yuxin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yuxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37337396100"},{"name":"Zhu Long","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Long","id":"37667496800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341653","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Biology computing","High performance computing","Hardware","Biological materials","Concurrent computing","Chemistry","Computational biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Lennard-Jones potential","molecular dynamics method","physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations system","parallel software","Lennard-Jones force","discrete function","interpolation","filter filtrate particles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Molecular Dynamics","FPGA","Lennard-Jones force"]}],"abstract":"Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, supported by parallel software and special hardware, are widely used in materials, computational chemistry and biology science.

Furthermore, programmers can have a direct control on the GPU pipeline using easy-to-use parallel programming environments, whereas they had to rely on specific graphics API's in the past. These advances in hardware and software make general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing widespread. In this paper, using the latest GPU and its software environment, we parallelize a computationally demanding financial application and optimize its performance. We also analyze the performance results compared with those obtained using CPU only. Experimental results show that GPU can achieve a superior performance, greater than 190x, compared with the CPU-only case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341509/5341510/05341742.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"445","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Scalable Computing and Communications; Eighth International Conference on Embedded Computing","doi":"10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Financial Derivatives Modeling Using GPU's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Graphics","Programming profession","Pipelines","Parallel programming","Hardware","Software performance","Computer applications","Concurrent computing","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","data visualisation","financial data processing","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial derivative modeling","graphic processing unit","multiple parallel programmable unit","graphics API","data visualisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","High Performance Computing","Financial Derivatives Modeling","Shared-Memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Financial Derivatives Modeling Using GPU's","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999252","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Financial Derivatives Modeling Using GPU's","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"3825a440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045311S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341509","isNumber":"5341510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5341510","articleId":"5341742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5341877,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwen Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37671184100"},{"name":"Yue Ma","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37671221300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3825-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5341877","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Web services","Embedded computing","Concrete","Telecommunication computing","Laboratories","Embedded software","Software quality","Multimedia computing","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic genetic algorithm","Web service composition","dynamic evolution evaluation policy","optimal Web service composite plan","quality of service","dynamic fitness evaluation policy","relation matrix coding scheme","dynamic penalty technology","Web service selection","global QoS constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["web service selection","genetic algorithm","fitness","global QoS evaluations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5341877","abstract":"A dynamic genetic algorithm characterized by a dynamic evolution evaluation policy is presented to select optimal web service composite plans from a lot of composite plans on the basis of global Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints.

Nowadays, there are many classification techniques being used to solve classification problems such as neural network, genetic algorithm, Bayesian and others. In this article, we attempt to present a study on how talent management can be implemented using decision tree induction techniques. By using this approach, talent performance can be predicted using past experience knowledge discovered from the existing database. In the experimental phase, we use selected classification algorithms from decision tree techniques to propose suitable classifier for the dataset. As a result, the C4.5 classifier algorithm shows the highest accuracy of model for the dataset. Consequently, the possible talent rules are generated based on C4.5 classifier especially for the talent forecasting purposes.","doi":"10.1109/DMO.2009.5341916","startPage":"15","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd Conference on Data Mining and Optimization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340228/5341891/05341916.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd Conference on Data Mining and Optimization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DMO.2009.5341916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification for talent management using Decision Tree Induction techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification tree analysis","Decision trees","Data mining","Predictive models","Electronic mail","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Bayesian methods","Classification algorithms","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","decision trees","humanities","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["talent management classification","decision tree induction techniques","data mining","neural network","genetic algorithm","Bayesian algorithm","knowledge discovery","database","C4.5 classifier algorithm","talent forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Mining","Classification","Decision tree","C4.5","Talent Forecasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5341916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Classification for talent management using Decision Tree Induction techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5341916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10999064","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification for talent management using Decision Tree Induction techniques","confLoc":"Kajand, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"10p04dmo09a04hamidah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073388S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340228","isNumber":"5341891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340228","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5341891","articleId":"5341916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5341993,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Pessin","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC), Av. do Trabalhador Siio-Carlense, sao Carlos, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Pessin","id":"37397190000"},{"name":"Fernando Osorio","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science ICMC, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC), Av. do Trabalhador Siio-Carlense, sao Carlos, SP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Osorio","id":"37281539000"},{"name":"Denis F.

They provide not only an automatic method to design ANN, but also an approach to study evolution and learning in the same framework. In prior works was analyzed the intersection of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms applied in the neutron spectrometry and dosimetry research area, however, several drawbacks were encountered, due mainly to the novel of this approach. Because this is an emergent technology, a lack of tools exists to carry out the analysis of the obtained results. In this work, it is presented the design of a computer tool which allows to analyze the neutron spectrometry and dosimetry results obtained by means of the hybrid technology based on evolutionary artificial neural networks. This tool was designed under the LabVIEW programming environment in a graphic user interface, which make easy, intuitive and friendly their use. At the same time,the operation speed of the program is high, carrying out the analysis in seconds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342004/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10999610","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342004/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Computational Tool Design for Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks in Neutron Spectrometry and Dosimetry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Tool Design for Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks in Neutron Spectrometry and Dosimetry","confLoc":"Cuernavaca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3799a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044213S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341932","isNumber":"5341933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341932","xplore-issue":"5341933","articleId":"5342004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342013,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin Cortez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, ITSON University, Obregon, Mexico"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Cortez","id":"37391709600"},{"name":"Miguel Bazdresch","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, ITESO University, Guadalajara, Mexico"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Bazdresch","id":"37391709700"},{"name":"Armando Garcia","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept, ITSON University, Obregon, Mexico"],"firstName":"Armando","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37402814700"},{"name":"Jose M.

In this paper we present an efficient and low-complexity, ordered, successive interference cancellation receiver based on sorted QR decomposition for the hybrid STBC-VBLAST transmission scheme.

Maintaining sufficient resources just to meet peak requirements can be costly. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand. In this paper, we will describe a novel architecture for the dynamic scaling of Web applications based on thresholds in a virtualized cloud computing environment. We will illustrate our scaling approach with a front-end load-balancer for routing and balancing user requests to Web applications deployed on Web servers installed in virtual machine instances. A dynamic scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual machine resources based on threshold number of active sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed.

In the absence of the fixed infrastructure that characterizes traditional wireless networks, control and management of wireless ad hoc networks must be distributed across the nodes, thus requiring carefully designed medium access control (MAC) layer protocols. In this article we survey, classify, and analyze 34 MAC layer protocols for wireless ad hoc networks, ranging from industry standards to research proposals. Through this analysis, six key features emerge: (1) channel separation and access; (2) topology; (3) power; (4) transmission initiation; (5) traffic load and scalability; and (6) range. These features allow us to characterize and classify the protocols, to analyze the tradeoffs produced by different design decisions, and to assess the suitability of various design combinations for ad hoc network applications. The classification and the tradeoff analysis yield design guidelines for future wireless ad hoc network MAC layer protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"First Quarter  2004","volume":"6","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11005495","publicationDate":"First Quarter 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342231/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A survey, classification and comparative analysis of medium access control protocols for ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey, classification and comparative analysis of medium access control protocols for ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"ieee-surveys-st-20041553-jurdak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109802S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2004","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5342230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5342230","articleId":"5342231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":5342238,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Maihofer","affiliation":["DaimlerChrysler AG, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Christian Maih\u00f6fer (christian.maihoefer@daimlerchrysler.com) received a diploma (Dipl.-Inf.) in computer science in 1997, and a Ph.

With geocast, new services and applications are feasible, such as finding friends who are nearby, geographic advertising, and accident or wrong-way driver warning on a motorway.

The protocols mainly differ in whether they are based on flooding, directed flooding, or on routing without flooding, and whether they are suitable for ad hoc networks or for infrastructure networks. Based on these criteria we propose a classification of geocast protocols. Our protocol comparison includes message and memory complexity, robustness, and the ability to deliver geocast packets in partially partitioned networks.

To make effective use of caching, an informative decision has to be made as to which documents are to be evicted from the cache in case of cache saturation. This is particularly important in a wireless network, where the size of the client cache at the mobile terminal (MT) is small. Several types of caching are used over the Internet, including client caching, server caching, and more recently, proxy caching. In this article we review some of the well known proxy-caching policies for the Web. We describe these policies, show how they operate, and discuss the main traffic properties they incorporate in their design. We argue that a good caching policy adapts itself to changes in Web workload characteristics. We make a qualitative comparison between these policies after classifying them according to the traffic properties they consider in their designs. Furthermore, we compare a selected subset of these policies using trace-driven simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5342235/05342239.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2004.5342239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2004.5342239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of web caching replacement algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["World Wide Web","Costs","Frequency","Measurement","Web sites","Web and internet services","Telecommunication traffic","Wireless networks","Network servers","Web server"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile terminal","Web caching replacement algorithms","client caching","server caching","proxy caching","Web services","Internet traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Second Quarter  2004","displayDocTitle":"An overview of web caching replacement algorithms","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5342239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2004","accessionNumber":"11005502","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of web caching replacement algorithms","sourcePdf":"ieee-surveys-st-20041553-balamash.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109425S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2004","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5342235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5342235","articleId":"5342239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5342245,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Wilhelm","affiliation":["Disco Distributed Computer Systems Laboratory, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Wilhelm","id":"37595267200"},{"name":"Ivan Martinovic","affiliation":["Disco Distributed Computer Systems Laboratory, Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Martinovic","id":"37267174400"},{"name":"Jens B.

Its unpredictable and erratic nature can also be turned against an adversary and used to augment conventional security protocols, especially key agreement. In this paper, we are inspired by promising studies on such key agreement schemes, yet aim for releasing some of their limiting assumptions. We demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme within performance-limited wireless sensor networks. The central idea is to use the reciprocity of the wireless channel response between two transceivers as a correlated random variable. Doing so over several frequencies results in a random vector from which a shared secret is extracted. By employing error correction techniques, we are able to control the trade-off between the amount of secrecy and the robustness of our key agreement protocol. To evaluate its applicability, the protocol is implemented on MicaZ sensor nodes and analyzed in indoor environments. Further, these experiments provide insights into realistic channel behavior, available information entropy, and show a high rate of successful key agreements, up to 95%.","doi":"10.1109/NPSEC.2009.5342245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NPSEC.2009.5342245","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE Workshop on Secure Network Protocols","pdfPath":"/iel5/5335586/5342240/05342245.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 5th IEEE Workshop on Secure Network Protocols","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On key agreement in wireless sensor networks based on radio transmission properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-13 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On key agreement in wireless sensor networks based on radio transmission properties","conferenceDate":"13-13 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342245/","accessionNumber":"11000070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342245/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On key agreement in wireless sensor networks based on radio transmission properties","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"071569236049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064681S","chronDate":"13-13 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5335586","isNumber":"5342240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5335586","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5342240","articleId":"5342245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5342290,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios D.

The lack of security obstructs a large deployment of this efficient communication model. This limitation motivated a host of research works that have addressed the many issues relating to securing the multicast, such as confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation, integrity, and access control. Many applications, such as broadcasting stock quotes and video-conferencing, require data origin authentication of the received traffic. Hence, data origin authentication is an important component in the multicast security architecture. Multicast data origin authentication must take into consideration the scalability and the efficiency of the underlying cryptographic schemes and mechanisms, because multicast groups can be very large and the exchanged data is likely to be heavy in volume (streaming). Besides, multicast data origin authentication must be robust enough against packet loss because most multicast multimedia applications do not use reliable packet delivery. Therefore, multicast data origin authentication is subject to many concurrent and competitive challenges, when considering these miscellaneous application-level requirements and features. In this article we review and classify recent works dealing with the data origin authentication problem in group communication, and we discuss and compare them with respect to some relevant performance criteria.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Third Quarter  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342292/","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5342292/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11005505","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A taxonomy of multicast data origin authentication: Issues and solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A taxonomy of multicast data origin authentication: Issues and solutions","sourcePdf":"ieee-surveys-st-20041553-challal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.248387S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2004","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5342289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5342289","articleId":"5342292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342293,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Seeling","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick Seeling received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in industrial engineering and management (specializing in electrical engineering) from the Technical University of Berlin (TUB), Germany, in 2002.

Consequently, the performance evaluation of networking architectures, protocols, and mechanisms for video traffic becomes increasingly important. Video traces, which give the sizes, deadlines, and qualities of the individual video frames in a video sequence, have been emerging as convenient video characterizations for networking studies. In this tutorial we give an introduction to the use of video traces in networking studies. First we give a brief overview of digital video and its encoding and playout. Then we present a library of traces of single- and two-layer encoded video. We discuss the statistical properties of the traces and the resulting implications for the transport of video over networks. Finally we discuss the factors that need to be considered when using video traces in network performance evaluations. In particular, we introduce performance metrics that quantify the quality of the delivered video. We outline a procedure for generating video load for network simulations from the traces, and discuss how to meaningfully analyze the outcomes of these simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Third Quarter  2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2004","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11005506","htmlLink":"/document/5342293/","displayDocTitle":"Network performance evaluation using frame size and quality traces of single-layer and two-layer video: A tutorial","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network performance evaluation using frame size and quality traces of single-layer and two-layer video: A tutorial","sourcePdf":"ieee-surveys-st-20041553-REISSLEIN.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169711S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2004","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5342289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"5342289","articleId":"5342293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5342312,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

However, attributes of atmospheric turbulence (scintillation) and obscurants such as clouds impose perennial limitations on availability and reliability of optical links. To design and evaluate optimum transmission techniques that operate under realistic atmospheric conditions, a good understanding of the channel behavior is necessary. In most prior works, Monte-Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) algorithm has been used to analyze the channel behavior. This task is quite numerically intensive. The focus of this paper is on investigating the possibility of simplifying this task by a direct extraction of state transition matrices associated with standard Markov modeling from the MCRT computer simulations programs. We show that by tracing a photon's trajectory in space via a Markov chain model, the angular distribution can be calculated by simple matrix multiplications. We also demonstrate that the new approach produces results that are close to those obtained by MCRT and other known methods. Furthermore, considering the fact that angular, spatial, and temporal distributions of energy are inter-related, mixing time of Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) for different types of aerosols is calculated based on eigen-analysis of the state transition matrix and possibility of communications in scattering media is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Wireless Optical Communications Feasibility in Presence of Clouds Using Markov Chains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Wireless Optical Communications Feasibility in Presence of Clouds Using Markov Chains","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999628","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342312/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Wireless Optical Communications Feasibility in Presence of Clouds Using Markov Chains","sourcePdf":"1526jsac0909hajjarian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078602S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5342313,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5342308/5342313/5342313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haipeng Ding (S'09) received his B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication and information system from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2004 and 2007 respectively.

The expected channel impulse response is obtained by computing photon arrival probabilities and associated propagation delay at the receiver. This method captures the multiple scattering effects of UV signal propagation in the atmosphere, and relaxes the assumptions of single scattering theory. The proposed model has a clear advantage in reliable prediction of NLOS path loss, as validated by outdoor experiments at small to medium elevation angles. A Gamma function is shown to agree well with the predicted impulse response, and this provides a simple means to determine the channel bandwidth. The developed model is employed to study the characteristics of NLOS UV scattering channels, including path loss and channel bandwidth, for a variety of scattering conditions, source wavelength, transmitter and receiver optical pointing geometries, and range.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342313.pdf","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of non-line-of-sight ultraviolet scattering channels for communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of non-line-of-sight ultraviolet scattering channels for communication","volume":"27","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342313/","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999629","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of non-line-of-sight ultraviolet scattering channels for communication","sourcePdf":"1535jsac0909ding.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074421S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342314,"authors":[{"name":"Georgia Ntogari","affiliation":["Optical Communications Laboratory, University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Georgia Ntogari was born in 1980.

Although it is known that the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points, finding it requires complex non-linear optimization at every SNR. In this work, a simple expression for a capacity-approaching distribution is derived via source entropy maximization. The resulting mutual information using the derived discrete non-uniform input distribution is negligibly far away from the channel capacity. The computation of this distribution is substantially less complex than previous optimization approaches and can be easily computed at different SNRs. A practical algorithm for non-uniform optical intensity signalling is presented using multi-level coding followed by a mapper and multi-stage decoding at the receiver. The proposed signalling is simulated on free-space optical channels and outage capacity is analyzed. A significant gain in both rate and probability of outage is achieved compared to uniform signalling, especially in the case of channels corrupted by fog.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091205","startPage":"1553","endPage":"1563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342315.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel capacity and non-uniform signalling for free-space optical intensity channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel capacity and non-uniform signalling for free-space optical intensity channels","volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999631","publicationDate":"December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342315/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel capacity and non-uniform signalling for free-space optical intensity channels","sourcePdf":"1553jsac0909farid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179833S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342318,"authors":[{"name":"L.

As real measurements in these scenarios are not possible yet, the objective is to obtain results as realistic as possible to support the design of future satellite missions performing QKD. Therefore, we use realistic values for the optical hardware and take into account usual atmospheric conditions. In the same line, we assume specific types of attacks, namely the photon number splitting and the intercept-resend with unambiguous discrimination attacks, which could likely be the main threat to the first satellite-based QKD applications. A lower bound on the key generation rate of SARG04 with two decoy states is presented. The optimum signal- and decoy-states mean photon numbers for each protocol and each distance are also computed. The resulting values for the signal-state are larger than those often employed. We show that it may be possible to establish QKD with LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and, under certain circumstances, with MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, but not with GEO (Geostationary) ones. Furthermore, we obtain that the optimum signal-state mean photon number for SARG04 with two decoy states is almost independent of the link distance, which greatly facilitates its use in a real scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342318.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091208","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of quantum cryptography protocols in optical earth-satellite and intersatellite links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342318/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of quantum cryptography protocols in optical earth-satellite and intersatellite links","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342318/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"10999634","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of quantum cryptography protocols in optical earth-satellite and intersatellite links","sourcePdf":"1582jsac0909sanchez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096356S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5342319,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Reinhardt","affiliation":["Electromagnetics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5342308/5342319/5342319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Colin Reinhardt received BSEE and BS in Physics from the University of Washington in 2005.

This method reduces run-time computational demands and system complexity in comparison to our previously proposed dual-wavelength channel estimation technique. We consider propagation of optical wavelengths in fog, where the droplet diameters are close to the wavelength and thus scattering and absorption effects are significant. A method for rapid calculation of a channel response function based on estimating the effective optical depth of the channel and curve-fitting is described. The channel response estimate can then be used to design a receiver-side equalizer (minimum mean-squared error linear equalizer) to correct the signal distortion due to propagation through the dispersive channel. The channel estimates are based on parametric curve-fitting functions which have been developed using the modified-vector radiative transfer theory to model the channel response. The optimal fit parameters are found using particle-swarm optimization to minimize the simulated bit-error rate of the received signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342319/","volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5342319/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10999635","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving bit-error-rate performance of the free-space optical communications system with channel estimation based on radiative transfer theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving bit-error-rate performance of the free-space optical communications system with channel estimation based on radiative transfer theory","sourcePdf":"1591jsac0909reinhardt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048975S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342319","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342321,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Nakhkoob","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5342308/5342321/5342321-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Nakhkoob received B.S. and M.Sc. degrees both in Electrical engineering from IUST (Iran Univ. of Sci. & Tech.)

Second, a cellular network in the aircraft is considered and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) maps are determined via simulation. For this purpose, a Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) simulation is performed in a geometric computer-aided design (CAD) cabin model with defined position, azimuth (AZ), elevation (EL) and field of view (FOV) properties of transmitters and receivers. Mathematical models are developed for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path losses along particular paths, including estimation of the path loss exponent and the shadowing component. The shadowing is modeled according to a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sigma. The validity of this model is confirmed in the paper. It is shown that irradiance distribution under LOS conditions experiences an attenuation with a path loss exponent of 1.92 and a shadowing standard deviation of 0.81 dB. In NLOS conditions, however, the path loss exponent varies, depending on the nature of the NLOS cases considered. The presented NLOS scenarios yield path loss exponent values of 2.26 and 1.28, and shadowing standard deviation values of 1.27 dB and 0.7 dB, respectively. Finally, the cabin is divided into cells and SIR maps are presented for different frequency reuse factors. It is shown that at the edges of the circular cells with diameter of 2.8 m, a SIR of -5.5 dB is achieved in a horizontal cross section of the cabin for frequency reuse of 1, and -2 dB and 3 dB for frequency reuse factors of 2 and 3, respectively. This means that in an aircraft cabin, for reuse factors less than three, viable communication at the cell edges is not feasible without additional interference avoidance or interference mitigation techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342322.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the SIR of a cellular infrared optical wireless system for an aircraft","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Shadow mapping","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Optical receivers","Computational modeling","Solid modeling","Design automation","Frequency","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","CAD","cellular radio","interference (signal)","log normal distribution","Monte Carlo methods","optical communication","ray tracing","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIR","cellular infrared optical wireless system","path loss models","infrared optical wireless transmission","aircraft cabin","cellular network","signal-to-interference ratio","Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation","geometric computer-aided design cabin model","azimuth","elevation","field of view property","non-line-of-sight","path loss exponent","shadowing component","log-normal distribution","irradiance distribution","shadowing standard deviation","frequency reuse factors","interference avoidance","interference mitigation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Path loss, LOS, NLOS, shadowing, SIR, infrared wireless, optical communications, Monte Carlo ray-tracing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the SIR of a cellular infrared optical wireless system for an aircraft","volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5342322/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999638","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the SIR of a cellular infrared optical wireless system for an aircraft","sourcePdf":"1623jsac0909dimitrov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118733S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342323,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The system encompasses a pair of novel terminals: these allow direct and transparent optical connection to common single mode fibers and include a dedicated electronic control unit that effectively tracks the signal beam wandering due to atmospheric turbulence and mechanical vibrations. Further improvement in the signal power stabilization is achieved by means of saturated EDFAs. These solutions allow to realize a new FSO system, which is tested in a double-pass FSO link between two buildings in Pisa, Italy. When the terminals are fed by common WDM signals they allow enough power budget and margins to support a record high capacity transmission (32times40 Gbit/s), with a enormous improvement of stability (six hours with no error burst). During day-long transmission, the system behavior has been deeply characterized to correlate any increase of bit error ratio (BER) to the FSO control parameters.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091213","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342323.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1.28 terabit/s (32x40 Gbit/s) wdm transmission system for free space optical communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"1.28 terabit/s (32x40 Gbit/s) wdm transmission system for free space optical communications","volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999639","publicationDate":"December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342323/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1.28 terabit/s (32x40 Gbit/s) wdm transmission system for free space optical communications","sourcePdf":"1639jsac0909ciaramella.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062226S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5342324,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic C.

Optical wireless communications, using a modulated retro-reflector at the smart dust has the advantages of low-power consumption and highly directive channels that allow long communications ranges. In this paper we report the design and implementation of a communications system that uses a base station to communicate with, and power, smart dust motes, over ranges of 10s of metres. A base station that uses holographic beamsteering is described, and dust motes that use silicon ICs to provide communications, power and modulation control.

The white LED sources that are typically used for general illumination can also be used for data transmission, and Visible Light Communications (VLC) is a rapidly growing area of research. One of the key challenges is the limited modulation bandwidth of sources, typically several MHz. However, as a room or coverage space would typically be illuminated by an array of LEDs there is the potential for parallel data transmission, and using optical MIMO techniques is potentially attractive for achieving high data rates. In this paper we investigate non-imaging and imaging MIMO approaches: a non-imaging optical MIMO system does not perform properly at all receiver positions due to symmetry, but an imaging based system can operate under all foreseeable circumstances. Simulations show such systems can operate at several hundred Mbit/s, and up to Gbit/s in many circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342325.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High data rate multiple input multiple output (MIMO) optical wireless communications using white led lighting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"High data rate multiple input multiple output (MIMO) optical wireless communications using white led lighting","volume":"27","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342325/","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999641","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342325/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High data rate multiple input multiple output (MIMO) optical wireless communications using white led lighting","sourcePdf":"1654jsac0909zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073413S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"638","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5342326,"authors":[{"name":"Fuad E.

In the absence of shadowing, replacing a single non-imaging receiver by an imaging receiver with maximal ratio combining (MRC) improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 20 dB in a conventional diffuse system (CDS) operating at 30 Mbit/s at a transmitter-receiver separation of 6 m in agreement with previous results in the field. Further SNR improvement of 24 dB is achieved when a line strip multi-beam system (LSMS) replaces the CDS when both systems employ an imaging MRC receiver. Furthermore, our new adaptive LSMS (ALSMS) system coupled with the imaging MRC receiver offers an SNR improvement of 23 dB over the imaging MRC LSMS illustrating the gain achieved through adaptation. The results also show that combining transmit power adaptation with spot diffusing (i.e. ALSMS) coupled with an imaging receiver based on select best (SB) increases the bandwidth from 46.5 MHz (non-imaging CDS) to 7.53 GHz thus enabling the OW system to achieve higher data rates and provide multi-user capabilities in our case by employing a MC-CDMA scheme.

Carrier class availability is a necessity for wide scale acceptability which is extremely difficult to achieve in the case of optical wireless links. FSO links are highly weather-dependent and different weather effects reduce the link availability. Employing a hybrid network consisting of an FSO link and a back up link in the GHz frequency range renders high availability besides providing comparable data rates. In this paper effects of fog, rain and snow on FSO/GHz hybrid network are studied so that GHz frequencies with best complementary behaviour can be selected as a back up link. As a prime conclusion of the article, it is suggested that free space optical links can be supplemented with 40 GHz RF links to achieve near carrier class availability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","publicationDate":"December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342328/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999644","volume":"27","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Weather effects on hybrid FSO/RF communication link","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weather effects on hybrid FSO/RF communication link","sourcePdf":"1687jsac0909nadeem.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094938S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5342329,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5342308/5342329/5342329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenzhe Zhang graduated with a B.Sc degree from Peking University, China in 2007 and with an M.A.Sc. degree from McMaster University, Canada in 2009 both in electrical engineering.

Radio-frequency (RF) links have lower data rates, but are relatively insensitive to weather. Hybrid FSO/RF links combine the advantages of both links. Currently, selection or \"hard-switching\" is performed between FSO or RF links depending on feedback from the receiver. This technique is inefficient since only one medium is used at a time. In this paper, we develop a \"soft-switching\" scheme for hybrid FSO/RF links using short-length Raptor codes. Raptor encoded packets are sent simultaneously on both links and the code adapts to the conditions on either link with very limited feedback. A set of short-length Raptor codes (\u03ba = 16 to 1024) are presented which are amenable to highspeed implementation. A practical Raptor encoder and decoder are implemented in an FPGA and shown to support a 714 Mbps data rate with a 97 mW power consumption and 26360 gate circuit scale. The performance of the switching algorithms is simulated in a realistic channel model based on climate data.

Since both links operate at vastly different carrier frequencies, we model the hybrid channel as a pair of parallel channels. Moreover, since the FSO channel signals at a higher rate than the RF channel, we incorporate this key feature in the parallel channel model. Both channels experience fading due to scintillation, which is slow compared to typical signalling rates. Under this framework, we study the fundamental limits of the hybrid channel. In particular, we analyse the outage probability in the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the outage diversity or SNR exponent of the hybrid system. First we consider the case when only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSIR case), and obtain the exponents for general scintillation distributions. These exponents relate key system design parameters to the asymptotic outage performance and illustrate the benefits of using hybrid systems with respect to independent FSO or RF links. We next consider the case when perfect CSI is known at both the receiver and transmitter, and derive the optimal power allocation strategy that minimises the outage probability subject to peak and average power constraints. The optimal solution involves non-convex optimisation, which is intractable in practical systems. We therefore propose a suboptimal algorithm that achieves significant power savings (on the order of tens of dBs) over uniform power allocation. We show that the suboptimal algorithm has the same diversity as the optimal power allocation strategy.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.091220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5342308/05342330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.091220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342308","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of the hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of the hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999646","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342330/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of the hybrid free-space optical and radio-frequency channel","sourcePdf":"1709jsac0909letzepis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132273S","chronDate":"December  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5342308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5342308","articleId":"5342330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342339,"authors":[{"name":"Byungsub Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5342337/5342339/5342339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byungsub Kim (S'06) was born in Busan, Korea.

Two main challenges are identified for an OBI-robust SDR receiver: out-of-band nonlinearity and harmonic mixing. Voltage gain at RF is avoided, and instead realized at baseband in combination with low-pass filtering to mitigate blockers and improve out-of-band IIP3. Two alternative \u00bfiterative\u00bf harmonic-rejection (HR) techniques are presented to achieve high HR robust to mismatch: a) an analog two-stage polyphase HR concept, which enhances the HR to more than 60 dB; b) a digital adaptive interference cancelling (AIC) technique, which can suppress one dominating harmonic by at least 80 dB. An accurate multiphase clock generator is presented for a mismatch-robust HR. A proof-of-concept receiver is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. Measurements show 34 dB gain, 4 dB NF, and + 3.5 dBm in-band IIP3 while the out-of-band IIP3 is +16 dBm without fine tuning. The measured RF bandwidth is up to 6 GHz and the 8-phase LO works up to 0.9 GHz (master clock up to 7.2 GHz). At 0.8 GHz LO, the analog two-stage polyphase HR achieves a second to sixth order HR > 60 dB over 40 chips, while the digital AIC technique achieves HR > 80 dB for the dominating harmonic. The total power consumption is 50 mA from a 1.2 V supply.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5342337/05342340.pdf","startPage":"3359","endPage":"3375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digitally Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Receiver Robust to Out-of-Band Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Digitally Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Receiver Robust to Out-of-Band Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342340/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11020420","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342340/","volume":"44","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digitally Enhanced Software-Defined Radio Receiver Robust to Out-of-Band Interference","sourcePdf":"44jssc12-zru-2032272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089183S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5342337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5342337","articleId":"5342340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5342341,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Joon Jeon","affiliation":["C & S Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5342337/5342341/5342341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Joon Jeon (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from the Pohang Institute of Scicence and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 1993, and 1995, respectively.

The amplifiers are designed to consume significantly less power than former implementations. Both designs operate with a 2.7 V single voltage supply and deliver a maximum output power of 250 mW into an 8 \u00bf speaker. The two class-D amplifiers are based on a hysteretic sliding mode controller, which avoids the complex task of generating the highly linear triangle carrier signal used in conventional architectures. The first design generates a two-level modulated signal, known as binary modulated amplifier (BMA); the second topology implements a three-level modulated signal, also called ternary modulated amplifier (TMA). The architectures and implementations are simple and compact, providing very low quiescent power consumption. Experimental results of the BMA/TMA yield an efficiency of 89/90% and a total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of 0.02/0.03%, respectively. The efficiency and linearity is comparable to state-of-the-art amplifiers but the static power consumption is less than one tenth of previous proposed architectures. Both class D amplifiers achieve a power supply rejection ratio greater than 75 dB at 217 Hz, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 90 dB within the whole audio band.

This work further improves the resolution, power efficiency, and robustness of previous zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBCs) and features a 90 nm CMOS, offset compensated, fully differential, zero-crossing based, 12b, 50 MS/s, pipelined ADC requiring no CMFB. The power consumption is 4.5 mW. The FOM is 88 fJ/step. Fully differential signaling is used to improve power supply rejection and power efficiency. A power efficient chopping offset compensation technique is presented. Reference voltage switching is improved to avoid gate boosted switches. Redundancy is used to reduce output range requirements for increased signal range. Two regenerative latch architectures used for bit decision comparison are analyzed and measured for offset, noise, and speed.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5342337/05342357.pdf","startPage":"3329","endPage":"3343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12b, 50 MS/s, Fully Differential Zero-Crossing Based Pipelined ADC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A 12b, 50 MS/s, Fully Differential Zero-Crossing Based Pipelined ADC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342357/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11020440","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342357/","volume":"44","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12b, 50 MS/s, Fully Differential Zero-Crossing Based Pipelined ADC","sourcePdf":"44jssc12-lbrooks-2032639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068092S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5342337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5342337","articleId":"5342357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342358,"authors":[{"name":"Kouichi Kanda","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouichi","lastName":"Kanda","id":"37283147800"},{"name":"Hirotaka Tamura","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Tamura","id":"37276936400"},{"name":"Takuji Yamamoto","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuji","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37310779900"},{"name":"Satoshi Matsubara","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Matsubara","id":"37285155800"},{"name":"Masaya Kibune","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaya","lastName":"Kibune","id":"37282826300"},{"name":"Yoshiyasu Doi","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiyasu","lastName":"Doi","id":"37278551800"},{"name":"Takayuki Shibasaki","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Shibasaki","id":"37601951500"},{"name":"Nestoras Tzartzanis","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nestoras","lastName":"Tzartzanis","id":"37282968900"},{"name":"Anders Kristensson","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Kristensson","id":"37681570700"},{"name":"Samir Parikh","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Parikh","id":"37670219100"},{"name":"Satoshi Ide","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Ide","id":"37338159100"},{"name":"Yukito Tsunoda","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukito","lastName":"Tsunoda","id":"37269831200"},{"name":"Tetsuji Yamabana","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuji","lastName":"Yamabana","id":"37681569100"},{"name":"Mariko Sugawara","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Mariko","lastName":"Sugawara","id":"37391022300"},{"name":"Naoki Kuwata","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Kuwata","id":"37602160700"},{"name":"Tadashi Ikeuchi","affiliation":["Fujitsu Company Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Ikeuchi","id":"37395868100"},{"name":"Junji Ogawa","affiliation":["System LSI Development Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37282829200"},{"name":"William W.

The measured results suggest that the slow-wave shielding of the passives is useful in achieving high performance and high frequency of operation. Our custom layout slotted plate capacitor employing slow-wave shield has low parasitic series resistance. Furthermore, as the substrate losses are minimal the modeling becomes more accurate. The measured based amplifier achieves +10 dBm output power at 100 GHz with a 1.2 V supply and 70 mA total DC-current consumption. The noise figure and gain at 100 GHz are 7.5 dB and 13 dB, respectively.

Most of the high power (watt-level) CMOS PAs reported to date have not exhibited sufficient linearity required for next generation wireless standards. In this paper, we report a single-chip linear CMOS PA with sufficient power and linearity for emerging OFDM-based 4G WiMAX applications. This 90 nm 2.4 GHz CMOS linear power amplifier uses a two-stage transformer-based power combiner and produces a saturated output power of 30.1 dBm with 33% PAE and 28 dB small-signal gain. A novel bypass network is introduced to ensure stability without sacrificing gain. The choice of optimal biasing and capacitive compensation produces very flat AM-AM and AM-PM response up to high power. The PA has been tested with OFDM modulated signal and produces EVM better than -25 dB at 22.7 dBm average power. Graceful power back-off is demonstrated through turning off one of the stages, allowing low-power operation with enhanced efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5342337/05342364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342337","startPage":"3393","endPage":"3402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Integrated Dual-Mode Highly Linear 2.4 GHz CMOS Power Amplifier for 4G WiMax Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Integrated Dual-Mode Highly Linear 2.4 GHz CMOS Power Amplifier for 4G WiMax Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11020453","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342364/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Integrated Dual-Mode Highly Linear 2.4 GHz CMOS Power Amplifier for 4G WiMax Applications","sourcePdf":"44jssc12-dchowdhury-2032277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048966S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5342337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5342337","articleId":"5342364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342365,"authors":[{"name":"Domine Leenaerts","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors Research, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5342337/5342365/5342365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Domine M.

The core of the modulator is a passive voltage mixer driven by 25% duty-cycle LO. In comparison with conventional approaches employing Gilbert mixers, the use of a passive voltage mixer results in significantly improved performance in terms of the output noise, linearity, LO leakage, EVM, and the power consumption in the transmitter. Delivering 4 dBm WCDMA output power at 1950 MHz, the transmitter prototype fabricated in a 45 nm CMOS achieves -48 dBc ACLR at 5 MHz offset, -71 dBc ACLR at 10 MHz offset, -54 dBc LO leakage, and 1.36% EVM, while consuming only 26 mW. The measured noise floor at 4 dBm output is -159 dBc/Hz at the frequency offset above 40 MHz, which is sufficient to safeguard the WCDMA RX band, the DCS band, and the GPS band without needing a TX SAW filter. In addition, optimized for low power consumption, over 80 dB gain control under voltage modulation is demonstrated in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5342337/05342370.pdf","startPage":"3448","endPage":"3458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2032495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Power, Low-EVM, SAW-Less WCDMA Transmitter Using Direct Quadrature Voltage Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power, Low-EVM, SAW-Less WCDMA Transmitter Using Direct Quadrature Voltage Modulation","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342370/","accessionNumber":"11020427","volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power, Low-EVM, SAW-Less WCDMA Transmitter Using Direct Quadrature Voltage Modulation","sourcePdf":"44jssc12-xhe-2032495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074273S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5342337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5342337","articleId":"5342370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342371,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuo Hidaka","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5342337/5342371/5342371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasuo Hidaka (S'91\u2013M'95) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1963.

The divider can be used in a wireless transceiver to prevent direct or harmonic pulling of the VCO by the power amplifier. Timing errors between the quadrature phases used in the phase-rotating divider introduce fractional spurs at the output. In this design, the timing errors are measured with a stochastic time-to-digital converter with 20 fs resolution, and corrected to suppress output spurs. The fractional divider has been implemented in a 45 nm CMOS LP process and its core dissipates an estimated 17 mA current from a 1.1 V supply. After calibration, fractional spurs are on average below -59 dBc and -50 dBc (\u00bf ~ 2 dB over 10 samples) with a 2.5 and 3.8 GHz output frequency respectively. Calibration performance has been confirmed for temperatures from -20\u00b0C up to 85\u00b0C. The low spur level facilitates radio co-existence with no need for additional filtering.

While there are a number of existing works along this line, many of them are only focused on learning from a single source domain to a target domain. In particular, a remaining challenge is how to apply the knowledge learned from multiple source domains to a target domain. Indeed, data from multiple source domains can be semantically related, but have different data distributions. It is not clear how to exploit the distribution differences among multiple source domains to boost the learning performance in a target domain. To that end, in this paper, we propose a consensus regularization framework for learning from multiple source domains to a target domain. In this framework, a local classifier is trained by considering both local data available in one source domain and the prediction consensus with the classifiers learned from other source domains. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis as well as an empirical study of the proposed consensus regularization framework. The experimental results on text categorization and image classification problems show the effectiveness of this consensus regularization learning method. Finally, to deal with the situation that the multiple source domains are geographically distributed, we also develop the distributed version of the proposed algorithm, which avoids the need to upload all the data to a centralized location and helps to mitigate privacy concerns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5611455/05342420.pdf","startPage":"1664","endPage":"1678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Domain Learning from Multiple Sources: A Consensus Regularization Perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Text categorization","Image classification","Learning systems","Data privacy","Laboratories","Information processing","Computers","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","multimedia computing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-domain learning performance","learning model","data characteristics","single source domain","multiple source domain","data distribution","local classifier","prediction consensus","text categorization","image classification","consensus regularization learning","distributed algorithm","privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","multiple source domains","cross-domain learning","consensus regularization."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Domain Learning from Multiple Sources: A Consensus Regularization Perspective","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5342420/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615828","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Domain Learning from Multiple Sources: A Consensus Regularization Perspective","sourcePdf":"ttk2010121664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087422S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5611455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5611455","articleId":"5342420","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342426,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuowen Tu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology and Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5552594/5342426/5342426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuowen Tu received the PhD degree from Ohio State University and the ME degree from Tsinghua University.

However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems for structured prediction problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-Context and Its Application to High-Level Vision Tasks and 3D Brain Image Segmentation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5552594/05342426.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Auto-Context and Its Application to High-Level Vision Tasks and 3D Brain Image Segmentation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5342426/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11476986","pubMedId":"20724753","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-Context and Its Application to High-Level Vision Tasks and 3D Brain Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"ttp2010101744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095962S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5552594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"333","xplore-issue":"5552594","articleId":"5342426","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5342427,"authors":[{"name":"Juan D.

In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of k-fold cross validation.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5392960/05342427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392960","startPage":"569","endPage":"575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of k-Fold Cross Validation in Prediction Error Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of k-Fold Cross Validation in Prediction Error Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11071322","pubMedId":"20075479","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5342427/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Analysis of k-Fold Cross Validation in Prediction Error Estimation","sourcePdf":"ttp2010030569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060927S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5392960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"659","xplore-issue":"5392960","articleId":"5342427","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5342432,"authors":[{"name":"Shankar Rao","affiliation":["HRL Laboratories LLC, Malibu, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5552594/5342432/5342432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shankar Rao received the BS degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001, and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering, the MS degree in applied mathematics, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2004, 2006, and 2009, respectively.

Using the affine camera model, this problem can be cast as the problem of segmenting samples drawn from multiple linear subspaces. In practice, due to limitations of the tracker, occlusions, and the presence of nonrigid objects in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories may contain grossly mistracked features, missing entries, or corrupted entries. In this paper, we develop a robust subspace separation scheme that deals with these practical issues in a unified mathematical framework. Our methods draw strong connections between lossy compression, rank minimization, and sparse representation. We test our methods extensively on the Hopkins155 motion segmentation database and other motion sequences with outliers and missing data. We compare the performance of our methods to state-of-the-art motion segmentation methods based on expectation-maximization and spectral clustering. For data without outliers or missing information, the results of our methods are on par with the state-of-the-art results and, in many cases, exceed them. In addition, our methods give surprisingly good performance in the presence of the three types of pathological trajectories mentioned above.

However, despite the large number of recent studies on the applicability of different search-based optimization approaches, there has been very little theoretical analysis of the types of testing problem for which these techniques are well suited. There are also few empirical studies that present results for larger programs. This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the most widely studied approach, the global search technique embodied by Genetic Algorithms. It also presents results from a large empirical study that compares the behavior of both global and local search-based optimization on real-world programs. The results of this study reveal that cases exist of test data generation problem that suit each algorithm, thereby suggesting that a hybrid global-local search (a Memetic Algorithm) may be appropriate. The paper presents a Memetic Algorithm along with further empirical results studying its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2009.71","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5439565/05342440.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"247","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2009.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5439565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Search-Based Testing: Local, Global, and Hybrid Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Search-Based Testing: Local, Global, and Hybrid Search","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11206171","publicationDate":"March-April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5342440/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Search-Based Testing: Local, Global, and Hybrid Search","sourcePdf":"tts2010020226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108244S","chronDate":"March-April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5439565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5439565","articleId":"5342440","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5342442,"authors":[{"name":"Zidong Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China","Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5371895/5342442/5342442-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zidong Wang (SM'03) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1966.

The discrete-time complex networks under consideration are subject to: (1) stochastic nonlinearities that occur according to the Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences; (2) stochastic disturbances that enter the coupling term, the delayed coupling term as well as the overall network; and (3) time delays that include both the discrete and distributed ones. Note that the newly introduced RONs and the multiple stochastic disturbances can better reflect the dynamical behaviors of coupled complex networks whose information transmission process is affected by a noisy environment (e.g., Internet-based control systems). By constructing a novel Lyapunov-like matrix functional, the idea of delay fractioning is applied to deal with the addressed synchronization analysis problem. By employing a combination of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, the free-weighting matrix method and stochastic analysis theories, several delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained which ensure the asymptotic synchronization in the mean square sense for the discrete-time stochastic complex networks with time delays. The criteria derived are characterized in terms of LMIs whose solution can be solved by utilizing the standard numerical software. A simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed results.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2033599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5371895/05342442.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2033599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Synchronization for Discrete-Time Stochastic Complex Networks With Randomly Occurred Nonlinearities and Mixed Time Delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342442/","displayDocTitle":"Global Synchronization for Discrete-Time Stochastic Complex Networks With Randomly Occurred Nonlinearities and Mixed Time Delays","volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037355","pubMedId":"19955035","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342442/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Synchronization for Discrete-Time Stochastic Complex Networks With Randomly Occurred Nonlinearities and Mixed Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tnn-wang-2033599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089754S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5371895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"426","xplore-issue":"5371895","articleId":"5342442","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342447,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Geol Lee","affiliation":["School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Seung Geol Lee photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Seung Geol","lastName":"Lee","id":"37678068600"},{"name":"Seung Soon Jang","affiliation":["School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/5458300/5342447/5342447-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Soon Jang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.","After working at Samsung Electronics for two years, he joined the Materials and Process Simulation Center (MSC) at CalTech and performed various forms of research in nanoelectronics, fuel cell, and interfacial systems as a director of Supramolecular Technology for six years.

The proposed methodology can take care of economic dispatch problems involving constraints such as transmission losses, ramp rate limits, valve point loading, multi-fuel options and prohibited operating zones. Biogeography deals with the geographical distribution of biological species. Mathematical models of biogeography describe how a species arises, migrates from one habitat to another and gets wiped out. BBO has some features that are in common with other biology-based optimization methods, like genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This algorithm searches for the global optimum mainly through two steps: migration and mutation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified on four different test systems, both small and large, involving varying degree of complexity. Compared with the other existing techniques, the proposed algorithm has been found to perform better in a number of cases. Considering the quality of the solution obtained, this method seems to be a promising alternative approach for solving the ELD problems in practical power system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biogeography-Based Optimization for Different Economic Load Dispatch Problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2034525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5452108/05342456.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2034525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Biogeography-Based Optimization for Different Economic Load Dispatch Problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5342456/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11256764","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biogeography-Based Optimization for Different Economic Load Dispatch Problems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-abhattacharya-2034525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164553S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5342456","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5342459,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Bourdel","affiliation":["IM2NP (UMR 6242), CNRS, Marseilles, France","Micro and Nano Electronic Department, IM2NP, Aix Marseille University, Marseilles, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5379166/5342459/5342459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sylvain Bourdel received the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from the National Institute of Applied Science (INSA), Toulouse, France, in 2000.","He was with the LASS Laboratory, Toulouse, France, where he was involved with RF system modeling with a particular focus on spread-spectrum techniques applied to 2.45-GHz transceivers.

The framework is based on a switched-mode hybrid-system paradigm, and especially on the interplay between its discrete-event dynamics and continuous-time dynamics. It is quite general, and most of the formulas obtained to-date for IPA on single-server queues can be derived from it as simple corollaries. Additional new results can be derived as well, and the paper demonstrates it by considering a queue with loss-rate-based flow control. The main contribution of the paper is in the proposed framework and its apparent broad scope. Its possible extension to a general class of fluid-flow queueing networks appears likely, and will be pointed out as a direction for future research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5342462/","accessionNumber":"11055072","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis in Stochastic Flow Models: The Single-Stage Case","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis in Stochastic Flow Models: The Single-Stage Case","sourcePdf":"54tac12-ywardi-2034228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121962S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5379206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5379206","articleId":"5342462","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5342463,"authors":[{"name":"Iordanis Koutsopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications Engineering, University of Thessally, Volos, Greece"],"firstName":"Iordanis","lastName":"Koutsopoulos","id":"37284280000"},{"name":"Leandros Tassiulas","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communications Engineering, University of Thessally, Volos, Greece"],"firstName":"Leandros","lastName":"Tassiulas","id":"37273302500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5342463","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Throughput","Modulation coding","State estimation","Automatic control","State feedback","Physical layer","Bit error rate","Bit rate","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","optimal control","radio links","state estimation","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission rate control policies","wireless link","partial state information","PHY layer transmission rate control","finite time horizon","positive acknowledgements","negative acknowledgements","partially observed Markov decision processes","time-invariant link quality","time varying link quality","state estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP)","rate adaptation","wireless link"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342463","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2033839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2033839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5379206/05342463.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmission Rate Control Policies in a Wireless Link Under Partial State Information","abstract":"We consider the problem of PHY layer transmission rate control for maximum throughput on a wireless link over a finite time horizon.

We cast the problem as a partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDP). We focus on the special case of time-invariant or slowly time varying link quality with two states and two control options. In that case, the optimal control problem is a state estimation one and the optimal strategy is of threshold structure, where the thresholds are certain values of the belief of being in one of the two states.

Due to force-scaling laws, large adhesion forces at the microscale make rapid, accurate release of microobjects a long-standing challenge in micromanipulation, thus representing a hurdle toward automated robotic pick-and-place of micrometer-sized objects. The system employs a novel microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microgripper with a controllable plunging structure to impact a microobject that gains sufficient momentum to overcome adhesion forces. The performance was experimentally quantified through the manipulation of 7.5-10.9 \u00bfm borosilicate glass spheres in an ambient environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the system, for the first time, achieves a 100% success rate in release (which is based on 700 trials) and a release accuracy of 0.45 \u00b1 0.24 \u00bfm. High-speed, automated microrobotic pick-and-place was realized by visually recognizing the microgripper and microspheres, by visually detecting the contact of the microgripper with the substrate, and by vision-based control. Example patterns were constructed through automated microrobotic pick-and-place of microspheres, achieving a speed of 6 s/sphere, which is an order of magnitude faster than the highest speed that has been reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2034831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5406215/05342467.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2034831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Robotic Pick-and-Place of Microobjects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Robotic Pick-and-Place of Microobjects","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5342467/","accessionNumber":"11105237","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Robotic Pick-and-Place of Microobjects","sourcePdf":"tro-sun-2034831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08806S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5406215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"5406215","articleId":"5342467","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5342469,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Hyun Park","affiliation":["Center of Noise and Vibration Control, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5536924/5342469/5342469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang-Hyun Park received the B.S. degree from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004, and the M.S. degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2006, both in mechanical engineering.

Among others, the three-pole AMB configuration turns out to be more profitable in terms of compactness in design and low power loss than the conventional four- or eight-pole AMB. However, one of the inherent drawbacks in controller design of three-pole AMB is the strong coupling in magnetic flux between magnetic poles. It leads to the strongly nonlinear system behavior, when the equation of motion is formulated in the conventional Cartesian coordinates. In this paper, we propose use of the redundant bearing coordinates to describe the three-pole AMB system behavior, so that the potential difference controllers can be easily designed, based on the decoupled linearized control model for each pole. The proposed method is applied to control of a five-axis AMB system, which consists of a three-pole radial AMB for stabilization in the radial direction and a ring-type permanent magnet bearing for levitation in the axial and tilt directions. It is shown that simplistic equation of motion for the five-axis AMB system can be derived in the proposed redundant bearing coordinates and the resulting control equations become completely decoupled. Experiments are also carried out with the five-axis disk-type AMB system equipped with Hall diodes for measurement of the radial displacement and it is confirmed that the proposed control scheme succeeds in the run-up test.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5536924/05342469.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"804","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2035113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2035113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5536924","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled Control of a Disk-Type Rotor Equipped With a Three-Pole Hybrid Magnetic Bearing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Equations","Control systems","Magnetic flux","Energy consumption","Rotating machines","Hard disks","Artificial heart","Blood","Pumps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","Hall effect","linearisation techniques","machine control","magnetic bearings","magnetic flux","magnetic levitation","nonlinear control systems","permanent magnet machines","redundancy","rotors","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disk type rotor","three pole hybrid magnetic bearing system","energy consumption","rotating machines","magnetic flux","magnetic poles","nonlinear system","equation of motion","conventional cartesian coordinate","redundant bearing coordinate","decoupled linearized control model","three pole radial AMB","radial direction","ring type permanent magnet bearing","five axis AMB system","Hall diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hall diode","permanent-magnet bearing","redundant coordinates","three-pole active magnetic bearing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled Control of a Disk-Type Rotor Equipped With a Three-Pole Hybrid Magnetic Bearing","volume":"15","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5342469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11450159","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled Control of a Disk-Type Rotor Equipped With a Three-Pole Hybrid Magnetic Bearing","sourcePdf":"tmech-lee-2035113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068096S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5536924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5536924","articleId":"5342469","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342470,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Fong Tsen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen Fong","lastName":"Tsen","id":"37403586500"},{"name":"Hsueh-Jyh Li","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsueh-Jyh","lastName":"Li","id":"37281090100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5342470","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","AWGN","Matrix decomposition","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","Mutual coupling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","impedance matching","impedance matrix","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncoupled impedance matching","capacity maximization","compact MIMO arrays","single-port matching impedance","multiple-input-multiple-output systems","ergodic capacity","optimized load impedance matrix","three-element arrays","array geometry","antenna spacing","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impedance matching","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","mutual coupling"]}],"abstract":"We extend the study of Fei (IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. 56, no. 11, pp. 35663575, Nov. 2008) on single-port matching impedance for capacity maximization in compact 2 \u00d7 2 multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems to N \u00d7 N MIMO systems. In addition, we increase the degrees of freedom of the uncoupled matching where each port is terminated by an arbitrary load impedance. By maximizing an upper bound of the ergodic capacity for a N \u00d7 N MIMO system with coupling at the receivers in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scheme, a set of equations is formulated to find the optimized load impedance matrix. Input impedance match is proved to be an optimum solution when the MIMO system operates in high SNR scenarios. For three-element arrays, we show numerically that a significant performance improvement can be achieved by introducing input impedance matching. Observations suggest that the achieved improvement varies with array geometry, antenna spacing, and SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncoupled Impedance Matching for Capacity Maximization of Compact MIMO Arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2009.2037445","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/05342470.pdf","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2009.2037445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","displayDocTitle":"Uncoupled Impedance Matching for Capacity Maximization of Compact MIMO Arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5342470/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"11104249","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncoupled Impedance Matching for Capacity Maximization of Compact MIMO Arrays","sourcePdf":"lawp-wtsen-2037445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055557S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4808186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4808186","articleId":"5342470","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342472,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5594752/5342472/5342472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Gong received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and mathematics (minor) from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008.

To meet the severe complexity constraint imposed by the ultrahigh data rate of the emerging optical transmission systems, we focus on hard-decision decoding of LDPC codes. A new LDPC hard decoding method is developed, which is equivalent to the Gallager decoding algorithm B, but is more efficient in terms of circuit implementation, since no variable node degree information is needed. Two variants of this decoder is also proposed, which offers significant performance gain for finite-length codes. We optimize the system by allocating rates and designing profiles for component codes. Both numerical evaluations and simulation results show that the optimized multilevel coding systems with either PID or MSD substantially outperform the optimized single-level LDPC-coded system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1279","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2034025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2034025","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5594752/05342472.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel LDPC-Coded High-Speed Optical Systems: Efficient Hard Decoding and Code Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342472/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel LDPC-Coded High-Speed Optical Systems: Efficient Hard Decoding and Code Optimization","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560866","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5342472/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel LDPC-Coded High-Speed Optical Systems: Efficient Hard Decoding and Code Optimization","sourcePdf":"jstqe-wang-2034025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081914S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5594752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5594752","articleId":"5342472","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5342475,"authors":[{"name":"Lihan He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Lihan","lastName":"He","id":"37269854100"},{"name":"Haojun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Haojun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37678107700"},{"name":"Lawrence Carin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Carin","id":"37280054700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5342475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1437},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Discrete cosine transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Tree data structures","Inference algorithms","Transform coding","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise measurement","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image reconstruction","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tree-structured compressive sensing","variational Bayesian analysis","transform coefficient","reconstruction accuracy","hierarchical statistical model","JPEG-based DCT","sparseness pattern","noise-free measurement","noisy CS measurement","wavelet representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compression","discrete cosine transform","sparseness","variational Bayesian signal processing"]}],"abstract":"In compressive sensing (CS) the known structure in the transform coefficients may be leveraged to improve reconstruction accuracy.

This negative resistance causes stability problems for the feeder system, whether it is an input filter or another converter. In multiconverter power electronic systems, which exist in different land, sea, air, and space vehicles, including electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles, there are many converters loaded by other converters. Therefore, the destabilizing effect of the load converters, which are called constant-power loads, is a major issue. In this paper, a novel nonlinear feedback, which is called loop cancellation, is introduced. This technique is used to cancel the destabilizing effect of the constant-power loads. Theoretically, any amount of constant-power load can be compensated by this technique, and it can identically be implemented on different types of converters. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been verified by PSpice simulations and experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05342479.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037429","startPage":"650","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop-Cancellation Technique: A Novel Nonlinear Feedback to Overcome the Destabilizing Effect of Constant-Power Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342479/","displayDocTitle":"Loop-Cancellation Technique: A Novel Nonlinear Feedback to Overcome the Destabilizing Effect of Constant-Power Loads","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342479/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11149593","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop-Cancellation Technique: A Novel Nonlinear Feedback to Overcome the Destabilizing Effect of Constant-Power Loads","sourcePdf":"tvt-emadi-2037429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098893S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5342479","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5342480,"authors":[{"name":"Haitham Abu-Ghazaleh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5415848/5342480/5342480-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haitham Abu-Ghazaleh (S'04) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and electrical engineering from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 1999 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2006.

Prior reservation of radio resources at future locations of a user's mobile trajectory can assist in optimizing the allocation of the network's limited resources and sustaining a desirable quality-of-service (QoS) level. This can also help to ensure that the network service can be available anywhere and anytime, which is only possible if, at any time, we can predict from where a user is going to make its demands. In this paper, we apply Markov renewal processes for both mobility modeling and predicting the likelihoods of the next-cell transition, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions, for an arbitrary user in a wireless network. Our proposed prediction technique will also be extended to compute the likelihoods of a user being in a particular state after \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n transitions. The proposed technique can also be used to estimate the expected spatial-temporal traffic load and activity at each location in a network's coverage area. Using some real traffic data, we illustrate how our proposed prediction method can lead to a significant improvement over some of the conventional methods.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5415848/05342480.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"802","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Mobility Prediction in Wireless Networks Using Markov Renewal Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Application of Mobility Prediction in Wireless Networks Using Markov Renewal Theory","htmlLink":"/document/5342480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11149578","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Mobility Prediction in Wireless Networks Using Markov Renewal Theory","sourcePdf":"tvt-abughazaleh-2037507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097417S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5415848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5415848","articleId":"5342480","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5342487,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Monzio Compagnoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5357518/5342487/5342487-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Monzio Compagnoni (M'08) was born in Busto Arsizio, Italy, in 1976.

In particular, a programmed cell is shown to display a larger threshold-voltage loss when its adjacent cells are in the erased than in the programmed state, with cells on the same bit line and word line having a similar impact on the acceleration of the threshold-voltage loss. The effect is explained by means of 3-D TCAD simulations, showing that a low threshold voltage for the adjacent cells increases the discharging tunneling current of the monitored cell for a fixed negative potential of its floating gate. This is due to a change of the electric field profile at the corners of the monitored cell active area when the potential of the floating gate of its neighboring cells is modified.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2035536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5357518/05342487.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2035536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5357518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Retention and Program/Erase Sensitivity to the Array Background Pattern in Deca-nanometer <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Data Retention and Program/Erase Sensitivity to the Array Background Pattern in Deca-nanometer <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342487/","accessionNumber":"11024620","volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Retention and Program/Erase Sensitivity to the Array Background Pattern in Deca-nanometer <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"ted-compagnoni-2035536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076034S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5357518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5357518","articleId":"5342487","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342488,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The presented method works computationally fast and does not require large wind data input, which is a requirement of many existing, commercially available simulation methods. The annually increasing OMCs, computed by this method, give better financial assessment of the wind power projects. The method presented is implemented on an Indian wind site.

The components, including the on-chip lens set, the microfluidic channel, and the fiber grooves, are defined in a single layer of SU-8 by one-step photolithography. The design of the on-chip lens set and the fabrication of the microfluidic chip are fully described. The influence of the beam-waist radius on the manipulation performance is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified for the first time. In the cross-type optofluidic architecture, the evaluation is performed by measuring the particle displacement with different beam-waist radii under different fluid-flow rates. The on-chip lens set is designed to have a specific dimension to achieve the required beam-waist radius. It is revealed that the particle displacement is counter-proportional to the beam-waist radius. An experiment is performed. The results show that the particle displacement is increased by reducing the beam-waist radius. The optical manipulation of microparticles is also demonstrated by using two counter-propagating light beams that are perpendicular to the fluid-flow direction with the beam-waist radius determined by two on-chip lens sets placed on the two sides of the microfluidic channel. The proposed architecture could be used to enhance the performance in particle transport, separation, and concentration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5540540/05342497.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2033212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2033212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5540540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Manipulation of Microparticles in an SU-8/PDMS Hybrid Microfluidic Chip Incorporating a Monolithically Integrated On-Chip Lens Set","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated optics","Microfluidics","Lenses","Optical design","Lithography","Fabrication","Performance analysis","Performance evaluation","Displacement measurement","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","lab-on-a-chip","microchannel flow","photolithography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microparticle optical manipulation","SU-8-PDMS hybrid microfluidic chip","monolithically integrated on-chip lens set","microfluidic channel","fiber grooves","beam-waist radius","cross-type optofluidic architecture","particle displacement","beam-waist radii","counter-propagating light beams","fluid-flow direction","particle transport","one-step photolithography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integrated devices","microfluidic device","optical manipulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optical Manipulation of Microparticles in an SU-8/PDMS Hybrid Microfluidic Chip Incorporating a Monolithically Integrated On-Chip Lens Set","volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5342497/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11494727","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Manipulation of Microparticles in an SU-8/PDMS Hybrid Microfluidic Chip Incorporating a Monolithically Integrated On-Chip Lens Set","sourcePdf":"jstqe-yao-2033212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065017S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5540540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5540540","articleId":"5342497","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342499,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Rezaeian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5342499/5342499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Rezaeian received the Bachelor degree in electronic engineering from Tehran University, Iran, the Master degree in telecommunication systems from Esfahan University of Technology, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute for Telecommunication Research, University of South Australia, in 2002.","He held research positions in the Institute for Telecommunication Research until 2004 and then in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia.

Detection refers to inference about the existence of the state, whereas estimation refers to inference about its value, when detected. Since we need to determine the existence/non-existence of the state as well as its value, the usual notion of Euclidean distance error does not jointly capture detection and estimation error in a meaningful manner. Treating the state as set, which can be either empty or singleton, admits a meaningful distance error for joint detection and estimation. We derive bounds on this distance error for a widely used class of observation models. When existence of the state is a certainty, our bounds coincide with recent results on Cramer-Rao bounds for estimation only problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342499/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11105822","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5342499/","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Error Bounds for Joint Detection and Estimation of a Single Object With Random Finite Set Observation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Bounds for Joint Detection and Estimation of a Single Object With Random Finite Set Observation","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-mrezaeian-2037665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076925S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5342499","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5342500,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Runge","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick Runge was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1979.

It exploits the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, which has been developed for data analysis in the field such as physics, geography and biology. Particularly, we present an accurate and closed-form solution for the position and velocity of a moving target. Unlike most passive target localization methods focusing on minimizing a loss function with respect to the measurement vector, the proposed method is based on the optimization of a cost function related to the scalar product matrix in the classical MDS framework. It is robust to the large measurement noise. The bias and variance of the proposed estimator is also derived. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves better performance than the spherical-interpolation (SI) method and the two-step weighted least squares (WLS) approach, and it attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound at a sufficiently high noise level before the threshold effect occurs. Moreover, for the proposed estimator the threshold effect, which is a result of the nonlinear nature of the localization problem, occurs apparently later as the measurement noise increases for a near-field target.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410625/05342507.pdf","startPage":"1677","endPage":"1688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2037666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2037666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Scaling Analysis for Passive Moving Target Localization With TDOA and FDOA Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Sensor arrays","Noise measurement","Frequency measurement","Position measurement","Time measurement","Biosensors","Data analysis","Physics","Geography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","least squares approximations","object detection","optimisation","sensor arrays","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional scaling analysis","passive moving target localization","TDOA measurements","FDOA measurements","target positioning","time differences of arrival","frequency differences of arrival","passive sensor array","optimization","measurement noise","spherical-interpolation method","weighted least squares approach","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive localization","multidimensional scaling","frequency differences of arrival (FDOA)","time differences of arrival (TDOA)","least squares"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Scaling Analysis for Passive Moving Target Localization With TDOA and FDOA Measurements","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5342507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105843","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Scaling Analysis for Passive Moving Target Localization With TDOA and FDOA Measurements","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-hwei-2037666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08903S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5342507","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342508,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Security Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37594321300"},{"name":"Chuankun Wu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Information Security Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chuankun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37556115000"},{"name":"Xijun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37652416200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6013"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6021"}],"articleNumber":"5342508","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Pixel","Laboratories","Information security","Computer science","Marine technology","Oceans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual cryptography schemes","multiple share images","average pixel expansion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secret sharing","step construction","visual cryptography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342508","abstract":"Two common drawbacks of the visual cryptography scheme (VCS) are the large pixel expansion of each share image and the small contrast of the recovered secret image.

Our scheme applies a technique to simplify the access structure, which can reduce the average pixel expansion (APE) in most cases compared with many of the results in the literature. Finally, we give some experimental results and comparisons to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5412136/05342508.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2037660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2037660","startPage":"27","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Step Construction of Visual Cryptography Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342508/","displayDocTitle":"Step Construction of Visual Cryptography Schemes","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11149509","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Step Construction of Visual Cryptography Schemes","sourcePdf":"05tifs01-fliu-2037660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039813S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5412136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"55","articleId":"5342508","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342511,"authors":[{"name":"Francis Minhthang Bui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5412136/5342511/5342511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francis Minhthang Bui (S'99\u2013M'08) received the B.A. degree in French language, and the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in 2001.

An integral component in BE is a key binding method, which is the process of securely combining a signal, containing sensitive information to be protected (i.e., the key), with another signal derived from physiological features (i.e., the biometric). A challenge to this approach is the high degree of noise and variability present in physiological signals. As such, fuzzy methods are needed to enable proper operations, with adequate performance results in terms of false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. In this work, the focus will be on a class of fuzzy key binding methods based on dirty paper coding known as quantization index modulation. While the methods presented are applicable to a wide range of biometric modalities, the face biometric is selected for illustrative purposes, in evaluating the QIM-based solutions for BE systems. Performance evaluation of the investigated methods is reported using data from the CMU PIE face database.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2037662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5412136/05342511.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2037662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Key Binding Strategies Based on Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) for Biometric Encryption (BE) Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342511/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Key Binding Strategies Based on Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) for Biometric Encryption (BE) Applications","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11149512","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342511/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Key Binding Strategies Based on Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) for Biometric Encryption (BE) Applications","sourcePdf":"tifs-bui-2037662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08458S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5412136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5412136","articleId":"5342511","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342512,"authors":[{"name":"Masataka Nakazawa","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Nakazawa","id":"37273573700"},{"name":"Seiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37392655300"},{"name":"Tatsunori Omiya","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsunori","lastName":"Omiya","id":"37392540900"},{"name":"Keisuke Kasai","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kasai","id":"37301698100"},{"name":"Masato Yoshida","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37293216900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5342512","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":749},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We report a polarization-multiplexed (Pol-Mux) 4-Gsymbol/s 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) coherent optical transmission over 160 km.

The widespread deployment of RFID technologies may generate new threats to security and user privacy. One of the main drawbacks of RFID technology is the weak authentication systems between a reader and a tag. In general, \u00bfweak\u00bf authentication systems that either leak the password directly over the network or leak sufficient information while performing authentication allow intruders to deduce or guess the password. In this paper, we study the RFID tag-reader mutual authentication scheme. A hardware implementation of the mutual authentication protocol for the RFID system is proposed. The proposed system was simulated using Modelsim XE II and synthesized using Xilinx synthesis technology. The system has been successfully implemented in hardware using an Altera DE2 board that included an Altera Cyclone II field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Finally, the output waveforms from the FPGA were displayed on the 16702A logic analysis system for real-time verification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of RFID Mutual Authentication Protocol","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037098","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5446457/05342514.pdf","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446457","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of RFID Mutual Authentication Protocol","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5342514/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228978","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of RFID Mutual Authentication Protocol","sourcePdf":"tie-huang-2037098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132176S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5446457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5446457","articleId":"5342514","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342515,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5545545/5342515/5342515-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Chen was born in Hangzhou, China, in 1982.

Possessing the very optimal ZVS +ZCS soft-switching feature, this proposed converter will have a minimized switching loss if all of the main switches are implemented with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and thereby, the proposed converter is fully soft switched and totally snubberless. The detail operation principles, as well as the design considerations, are presented. The methodologies to develop a unidirectional ZVS+ZCS dc-dc converter for the corresponding pulsewidth modulation and frequency modulation converters are proposed. The approach on how to construct a fully soft-switched BDC has also been proposed and analyzed. Finally, a topology extension is made, and another fully soft-switched BDC is derived.

Then, we introduce a novel formulation of IAC, called robust intelligent adaptive curiosity (R-IAC), and show that its performances as an intrinsically motivated active learning algorithm are far superior to IAC in a complex sensorimotor space where only a small subspace is neither unlearnable nor trivial. We also show results in which the learnt forward model is reused in a control scheme.

Due to the computational power and high-speed input and output, a real-time simulator is capable of conducting repetitive simulations of wind profiles in a short time with detailed models of critical components and allows testing of prototype controllers through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). This paper discusses methods to overcome the challenges of real-time simulation of wind systems, characterized by their complexity and high-frequency switching. A hybrid flow-battery supercapacitor energy storage system (ESS), coupled in a wind turbine generator to smooth wind power, is studied by real-time HIL simulation. The prototype controller is embedded in one real-time simulator, while the rest of the system is implemented in another independent simulator. The simulation results of the detailed wind system model show that the hybrid ESS has a lower battery cost, higher battery longevity, and improved overall efficiency over its reference ESS.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05342521.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037103","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Simulation of a Wind Turbine Generator Coupled With a Battery Supercapacitor Energy Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342521/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Simulation of a Wind Turbine Generator Coupled With a Battery Supercapacitor Energy Storage System","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342521/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11168830","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Simulation of a Wind Turbine Generator Coupled With a Battery Supercapacitor Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2037103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068339S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5342521","onlineDate":"01 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5342530,"authors":[{"name":"Vicente Milanes","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Milanes","id":"37568845900"},{"name":"Joshu\u00e9 Perez","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Joshu\u00e9","lastName":"Perez","id":"37400302800"},{"name":"Enrique Onieva","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Onieva","id":"37396455100"},{"name":"Carlos Gonzalez","affiliation":["Industrial Computer Science Department, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto de Autom\u00e1tica Industrial (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37271185200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-9050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0016"}],"articleNumber":"5342530","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1707},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","url":"http://sites.ieee.org/itss/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Wireless communication","Fuzzy logic","Communication system traffic control","Intelligent transportation systems","Remotely operated vehicles","Circuit testing","Intelligent vehicles","Control systems","Vehicle driving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","fuzzy control","mobile radio","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban intersections","wireless communications","fuzzy logic","intelligent transportation systems","vehicular traffic","crossroads","traffic jams","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","fuzzy controller","autonomous vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accident detection","autonomous vehicles","fuzzy control","intervehicle communication","traffic management"]}],"abstract":"A major research topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) is the development of systems that will be capable of controlling the flow of vehicular traffic through crossroads, particularly in urban environments.

Because process control systems can be spread over large distances, wired connections become infeasible. Commercially available wireless radios are often used in place of wires to connect network nodes. In this paper we provide an overview of process control systems, discuss how process control systems differ from networks commonly found in the information technology domain, demonstrate the ability to detect and infiltrate a wireless radio network used in control systems, and finally, detail a denial of service attack against a process control system. This attack denies feedback from nodes monitoring the controlled physical process and is therefore a dangerous cyber-attack.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 20 2009-Oct. 21 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20 Sept.-21 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342612/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998935","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Discovery, infiltration, and denial of service in a process control system wireless network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovery, infiltration, and denial of service in a process control system wireless network","confLoc":"Tacoma, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"Reavesecrimepubid.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058022S","chronDate":"Sept. 20 2009-Oct. 21 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339470","isNumber":"5342603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339470","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5342603","articleId":"5342612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5342625,"authors":[{"name":"Santanu Das","affiliation":["Office of Naval Research, Arlington, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Das","id":"38183851800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3358-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3359-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5342625","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space technology","Space missions","Optical fiber communication","Laser modes","Bandwidth","Quantum well devices","Radio frequency","Costs","Delay","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military communication","optical communication","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["naval free space optical communications","retro-reflective transmission mode","tactical free-space optical communications","RF denied environments"]}],"abstract":"Tactical free-space optical communications can add a significant capability to Naval missions, from high bandwidth to operation in RF denied environments.

As a result, the most advantageous feature of optical beam-formers using chirped grating, which is squint-free, has to be reconsidered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"10999505","htmlLink":"/document/5342679/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optical beamforming using chirped fiber grating: Criticality of group delay ripple","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical beamforming using chirped fiber grating: Criticality of group delay ripple","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"th423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059324S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5325518","isNumber":"5342587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5325518","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5342587","articleId":"5342679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ITEAM-UPV and NTC-UPV","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5342686,"authors":[{"name":"Mikel Sagues","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad P\u00d9blica de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Sagues","id":"37590345700"},{"name":"Alayn Loayssa","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Universidad P\u00d9blica de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alayn","lastName":"Loayssa","id":"37267252200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4788-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5342686","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342686","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Optical arrays","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical beams","Optical scattering","Array signal processing","Antenna arrays","Brillouin scattering","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","beam steering","microwave photonics","optical receivers","stimulated Brillouin scattering","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stimulated Brillouin scattering","RF phase shift","optical feed networks","phased array antennas","optical beamforming","5-element array","beam steering","wavelength division multiplexer","optical receivers"]}],"publicationTitle":"2009 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5325518/5342587/05342686.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical beamforming for phased array antennas using stimulated Brillouin Scattering","abstract":"We present a technique to use Stimulated Brillouin Scattering processing for RF phase-shift in optical feed networks of phased array antennas.

BCI research and development has grown explosively over the past two decades. Efforts have begun recently to provide laboratory-validated BCI systems to severely disabled individuals for real-world applications. In this paper, we discuss the current status and future prospects of BCI technology and its clinical applications. We will define BCI, review the BCI-relevant signals from the human brain, and describe the functional components of BCIs. We will also review current clinical applications of BCI technology and identify potential users and potential applications. Lastly, we will discuss current limitations of BCI technology, impediments to its widespread clinical use, and expectations for the future.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2009.2035356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/5338177/05342720.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2009.2035356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clinical Applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces: Current State and Future Prospects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342720/","displayDocTitle":"Clinical Applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces: Current State and Future Prospects","volume":"2","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"11000668","pubMedId":"20442804","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342720/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clinical Applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces: Current State and Future Prospects","sourcePdf":"rbme-mak-2035356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219892S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"5338177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"5338177","articleId":"5342720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5342734,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Akiyama","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Akiyama","id":"37289409400"},{"name":"Akiomi Satoh","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Akiomi","lastName":"Satoh","id":"37669353600"},{"name":"Kazushi Nishizawa","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazushi","lastName":"Nishizawa","id":"37277499800"},{"name":"Syuhei Yamamoto","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Syuhei","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37276830400"},{"name":"Shigetaka Itakura","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigetaka","lastName":"Itakura","id":"37561090100"},{"name":"Yoshihito Hirano","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihito","lastName":"Hirano","id":"37277929500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4788-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5342734","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342734","abstract":"Optically controlled beam forming techniques are effective for phased-array antenna control.

It began with modeling of the insulin-glucose system, and progressed to large-scale in silico experiments, and automated closed-loop control (artificial pancreas). Here, we follow these engineering efforts through the last, almost 50 years. We begin with the now classic minimal modeling approach and discuss a number of subsequent models, which have recently resulted in the first in silico simulation model accepted as substitute to animal trials in the quest for optimal diabetes control. We then review metabolic monitoring, with a particular emphasis on the new continuous glucose sensors, on the analyses of their time-series signals, and on the opportunities that they present for automation of diabetes control. Finally, we review control strategies that have been successfully employed in vivo or in silico, presenting a promise for the development of a future artificial pancreas and, in particular, discuss a modular architecture for building closed-loop control systems, including insulin delivery and patient safety supervision layers. We conclude with a brief discussion of the unique interactions between human physiology, behavioral events, engineering modeling and control relevant to diabetes.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2009.2036073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2009.2036073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/5338177/05342789.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diabetes: Models, Signals, and Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Diabetes: Models, Signals, and Control","volume":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5342789/","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"11068984","pubMedId":"20936056","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342789/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diabetes: Models, Signals, and Control","sourcePdf":"rbme-cobelli-2036073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.536014S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"5338177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"5338177","articleId":"5342789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5342808,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Vilovi\u0107","affiliation":["University of Dubrovnik, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Vilovi\u0107","id":"37268493800"},{"name":"Nik\u0161a Burum","affiliation":["University of Dubrovnik, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nik\u0161a","lastName":"Burum","id":"37303123200"},{"name":"\u0110or\u0111e Mili\u0107","affiliation":["University of Dubrovnik, Croatia"],"firstName":"\u0110or\u0111e","lastName":"Mili\u0107","id":"37087163065"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-953-7044-10-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"5342808","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":559},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Floors","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Indoor environments","Optimization methods","Multilayer perceptrons","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence of numerical methods","electrical engineering computing","electromagnetic fields","gradient methods","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO algorithm","neural network training","backpropagation algorithm","indoor field strength prediction","RF propagation prediction","BP training algorithms","gradient descent method","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","Dubrovnik","university building","convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Multilayer Perceptron","Training algorithm","Backpropagation algorithm","Gradient descent algorithm","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342808","abstract":"This paper presents a comparison of results obtained from neural network training by backpropagation and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.

These impairments result in inter-bin interference (IBI) which causes errors in the constellation diagram of each subcarrier. Changes in amplitude and phase of the subcarriers by IBI combined with communication system noise can cause increased bit error rate (BER) in the demodulation process of some modulation types, particular for higher order types where one symbol consist of more bits. Because the Fourier Transform is a fundamental operation in processing subcarriers in OFDM systems we have analyzed the inter-bin interference by means of FFT, IFFT and some statistical methods to clarify the statistical behavior of the errors.

The results show that in comparison with the use of spatial domain, compressed components frequency domain produces better and faster recognition performance for different range of compression ratios.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339379/5342791/05342865.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342791","startPage":"41","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory efficient face recognition using Compressed Phase Component","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory efficient face recognition using Compressed Phase Component","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342865/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11046447","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory efficient face recognition using Compressed Phase Component","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"016origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057444S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339379","isNumber":"5342791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339379","xplore-issue":"5342791","articleId":"5342865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronic","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5342868,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Dumic","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Dumic","id":"37597311100"},{"name":"Mario Mustra","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Mustra","id":"37567634600"},{"name":"Sonja Grgic","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Sonja","lastName":"Grgic","id":"37268288700"},{"name":"Goran Gvozden","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Gvozden","id":"37550775900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-953-7044-10-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"5342868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Video compression","Transform coding","Image coding","Encoding","Bit rate","Humans","Wireless communication","Image sampling","Additives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image colour analysis","image sampling","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image quality","chroma subsampling formats","video compression formats","sampling rate","video signal","HVS","human visual system","image luminance","image chrominance","MPEG-2 compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RGB","YUV","MPEG-2","chroma subsampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342791","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium ELMAR","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium ELMAR","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339379/5342791/05342868.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image quality of 4\u22362\u22362 and 4\u22362\u22360 chroma subsampling formats","abstract":"There is a large number of different video compression formats being used for various purposes today. These formats differ between each other in possibility of achieving suitable bitrates while maintaining acceptable image quality. Current video compression standards offers the possibility of different sampling rate for the luminant and the chrominant components of video signal. Because HVS is much more sensitive to changes in luminance than changes in chrominance of an image, compression can be achieved by subsampling the chroma components. This paper presents the measurement of the influence of two different chroma subsampling formats (4:2:2 and 4:2:0) on image quality after MPEG-2 compression. The obtained results show that 4:2:0 subsampling format gives slightly better results for bitrates up to 15 Mbit/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5342868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5342868/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002166","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image quality of 4\u22362\u22362 and 4\u22362\u22360 chroma subsampling formats","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image quality of 4\u22362\u22362 and 4\u22362\u22360 chroma subsampling formats","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"011origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042822S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339379","isNumber":"5342791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339379","xplore-issue":"5342791","articleId":"5342868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronic","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5342935,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Bellan","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Bellan","id":"37265472400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4901-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5342935","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude estimation","Quantization","Analytical models","Uncertainty","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Numerical simulation","Signal analysis","Additive noise","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","discrete Fourier transforms","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sine wave amplitude estimation","A-D conversion process","discrete Fourier transform","quantization","numerical simulation","analog-digital conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude estimation","analog-digital conversion","frequency domain analysis","quantization","uncertainty"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5342935","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS.2009.5342935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2009.5342935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342880","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337789/5342880/05342935.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude estimation of a sine wave with unknown offset in A/D conversion processes","abstract":"This paper deals with the application of the analytical model of quantization in order to characterize the uncertainty in the estimation of the amplitude of a sine wave with unknown offset through the discrete Fourier transform.

These trends, together with high test costs, make the validation of VLSI circuits more and more difficult. Beside high-end ATE machines, strictly necessary in ASIC production phase, low-cost ATE test systems take place into market to implement a valid support in ASIC development phase. In this paper a case study of low-cost, reconfigurable, versatile and easy-to-use FPGA-based test environment is presented. It allows patterns to be extracted from HDL-simulation and stimuli to be generated to ASIC prototypes, especially when a high-end test machine setup isn't foreseen or isn't available yet. This is the ideal solution for engineers to develop test programs and perform device tests and yield analysis on their desktop and then transfer the test program directly to production. The result is low-cost automatic test equipment, able to execute a preliminary digital test, using just a laptop and an FPGA-equipped board.","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS.2009.5343031","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5337789/5342880/05343031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2009.5343031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5342880","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based low-cost automatic test equipment for digital integrated circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5343031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based low-cost automatic test equipment for digital integrated circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5343031/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11005084","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5343031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based low-cost automatic test equipment for digital integrated circuits","confLoc":"Rende, Italy","sourcePdf":"032037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061034S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5337789","isNumber":"5342880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5337789","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5342880","articleId":"5343031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5343033,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Mostardini","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Mostardini","id":"37670589200"},{"name":"Luca Benvenuti","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benvenuti","id":"37347135400"},{"name":"Luca Bacciarelli","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bacciarelli","id":"37644291500"},{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fanucci","id":"37265849900"},{"name":"Christian Rosadini","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy","Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Rosadini","id":"37330573400"},{"name":"Alessandro Rocchi","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics AG, Pisa, Italy","Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Rocchi","id":"37352270100"},{"name":"Marco De Marinis","affiliation":["SensorDynamics AG, Navacchio (Pisa), Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"De Marinis","id":"37352244400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4901-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4882-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5343033","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Packaging","Pins","Signal sampling","Control systems","Universal Serial Bus","Real time systems","Displays","Data mining","Automotive engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","automotive electronics","data acquisition","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","signal processing equipment","system-on-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","advanced digital signal inspector","data sampling","PC","USB","graphical interface","MEM gyro senso","application specific integrated circuits","ASIC","pin-limited systems-on-package","ADC","ADSI","external accelerometer","mechanical shocks","automotive SoP"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents an Advanced Digital Signal Inspector (ADSI) used for acquisition and analysis of the internal digital of a System on Package (SoP) with a limited number of pins.

One of the challenges posed by the study of VANETs is the definition of a vehicular mobility model providing an accurate and realistic vehicular mobility description at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Another challenge is to be able to dynamically alter this vehicular mobility as a consequence of the vehicular communication protocols. Many mobility models have been developed by the community in order to solve these two issues. However, due to the large number of available models claiming to be adapted to vehicular traffic, and also due to their different and somehow incomparable features, understanding their true characteristics, their degree of realism with respect to vehicular mobility, and real capabilities is a hard task. In this survey, we first introduce a framework that proposes a guideline for the generation of vehicular mobility models. Then, we illustrate the different approaches chosen by the community for the development of vehicular mobility models and their interactions with network simulators. Finally, we propose an overview and taxonomy of a large range of mobility models available for vehicular ad hoc networks. The objective is to provide readers with a guideline to easily understand and objectively compare the different models, and eventually identify the one required for their needs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2009.090403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5343058","startPage":"19","endPage":"41","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5343058/05343061.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility models for vehicular ad hoc networks: a survey and taxonomy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5343061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5343061/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mobility models for vehicular ad hoc networks: a survey and taxonomy","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2009","accessionNumber":"11018878","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility models for vehicular ad hoc networks: a survey and taxonomy","sourcePdf":"3haerri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136045S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5343058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"431","xplore-issue":"5343058","articleId":"5343061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5343062,"authors":[{"name":"Aristides Mpitziopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of Aegean, Lesvos, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/5343058/5343062/5343062-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aristides Mpitziopoulos graduated from Hellenic Air Force Technical NCO Academy in 1996 with the speciality of telecommunications engineer.

If the received signal quality is not within the receiver sensitivity threshold, the receiver may not be able to correctly detect the optical signal and this may result in high bit-error rates. Hence, it is important to understand various PLIs and their effect on optical feasibility, analytical models, and monitoring and mitigation techniques. Introducing optical transparency in the physical layer on one hand leads to a dynamic, flexible optical layer with the possibility of adding intelligence such as optical performance monitoring, fault management, etc. On the other hand, transparency reduces the possibility of client layer interaction with the optical layer at intermediate nodes along the path. This has an impact on network design, planning, control, and management. Hence, it is important to understand the techniques that provide PLI information to the control plane protocols and that use this information efficiently to compute feasible routes and wavelengths. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of various PLIs, their effects, and the available modeling and mitigation techniques. We then present a comprehensive survey of various PLI-aware network design techniques, regenerator placement algorithms, routing and wavelength assignment algorithms, and PLI-aware failure recovery algorithms. Furthermore, we identify several important research issues that need to be addressed to realize dynamically reconfigurable next-generation optical networks. We also argue the need for PLI-aware control plane protocol extensions and present several interesting issues that need to be considered in order for these extensions to be deployed in real-world networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5343058/05343065.pdf","startPage":"109 ","endPage":"130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

Kernel discriminant analysis is an effective nonlinear feature extraction technique. Based on them, we propose a novel feature extraction approach for face recognition.

By computing the kernel-plural discriminant capability of every frequency band, we choose the bands with strong capabilities and use them to form a new sample set. Then, we extract nonlinear discriminant features from the set and classify it by using the nearest neighbor classifier.

To solve this issue, a new genetic algorithm of self-adaptive annealing is designed on the basis of standard genetic algorithm, combined with algorithms for global optimization of simulated annealing to optimize the connection weights. Furthermore, since the standard genetic algorithm is found to have such issues as early immature convergence and late search retardation; difficult coordination of crossover and mutation operator; weak capacity of local search; single way to update the group hard to take care of both the diversity and convergence requirements; slower convergence rate, etc. Based on the characteristics of the algorithm structure, genetic algorithm with parallelism applies the adaptive annealing strategy in calculating the selection probability to enhance the convergence of the genetic algorithm, while adaptive processing is made on the selection of the probability of crossover and mutation to further improve the stability and convergence of the genetic algorithm. The mixed use of genetic algorithms and other algorithms can achieve the advantageous objective while avoiding the disadvantages.

The accelerated stress levels and reliability are used as the training input vectors, while well-regulated failure data operated by Grey Accumulated Generate Operation (AGO) principle as training target vectors. Then RBF neural net is established and trained. Eventually, the failure data under normal stress can be predicted by putting the normal stress levels and the reliability into the model, and reliability curves can be drawn if life distribution is known.

The project has harnessed the skills of 4 UK Universities working together to understand the potential benefits for its industrial members of cognitive radio technology. This paper discusses some of the work that has been carried out by the Mobile VCE researchers in the field of cognitive radio together with some of the key results and conclusions. The central work has developed algorithms that control the dynamic allocation of radio resources between cooperating network operators as well as spectrum access protocols that allow suitably equipped terminals to sense and use free spectrum. Simulation work has shown that a gain in the efficiency of spectrum use is feasible for both types of spectrum sharing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345335.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing and cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345335/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing and cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003268","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing and cognitive radio","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569245891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061674S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5345346,"authors":[{"name":"Sultan Aldirmaz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sultan","lastName":"Aldirmaz","id":"38334591900"},{"name":"Asli Birol","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Asli","lastName":"Birol","id":"37398810500"},{"name":"Ibrahim Demirdogen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Demirdogen","id":"37680604500"},{"name":"Huseyin Arslan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"},{"name":"Lutfiye Durak","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Lutfiye","lastName":"Durak","id":"37398785100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345346","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Scattering","Chromium","Frequency conversion","FCC","Interference","Wireless sensor networks","Robustness","Fading","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","cognitive radio systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","power spectral density","scattered subcarrier allocation scheme","overlay system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","cognitive radio systems","opportunity search","subcarrier allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this study, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based primary and secondary usage in a cognitive radio system is considered and conventional power spectral density (PSD) based technique is used to detect the opportunities in the spectrum. Primary user employs block-based or scattered subcarrier allocation scheme and the overlay system aims to utilize the spectral gaps. Comparison of the allocation schemes and effect of windowing are presented in terms of true detection and false alarm rates. It is observed that when block-based allocation is employed, the unlicensed user will be able to detect more opportunities in the spectrum compared to the case in which the scattered allocation is employed. Simulation results show that threshold selection is crucial since it is the main factor in determining the false alarm and true detection rates. It has been shown that, for either of the schemes all possible spectral gaps cannot be found when PSD is used. Questioning the suitability of PSD method results in that a new definition of opportunity is needed, forming a basis for the second part of this study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On suitability of PSD method for opportunity detection in OFDM(A) based cognitive radio systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345346","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345346.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On suitability of PSD method for opportunity detection in OFDM(A) based cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345346/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003279","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On suitability of PSD method for opportunity detection in OFDM(A) based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569236865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044433S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345349,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Previously proposed routing protocols assume the presence of a connected path from the source to the destination. In some scenarios, due to the characteristics of ad hoc networks and the features of the used cognitive radios, this assumption is likely to be invalid. In this study, a novel routing algorithm for future multi-hop cognitive radio networks is proposed. This paper also presents two routing metrics that suit well to the cognitive radio networks. The main motivation is to maximize data rates and minimize delay for a set of user communication sessions. Experimental evaluations are performed in the ns2 simulator. It has been shown that the proposed approach provides better adaptability to the environment and maximizes throughput in a number of realistic scenarios and outperforms recently proposed routing protocols for cognitive radio networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345349.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ROPCORN: Routing protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345349/","displayDocTitle":"ROPCORN: Routing protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003282","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ROPCORN: Routing protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569238121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04053S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345352,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Chiani","affiliation":["WiLab/DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Chiani","id":"37268945300"},{"name":"Moe Z.

Cognitive radios have ability to sense the ambience, spectrum usage, geo conditions and fuse these information to arrive at a spectrum decision which helps to access the network in a `smart', controlled manner. However, the incumbent licensed systems are not sure on the robustness and accuracy of the sensing systems of these cognitive radios and have serious concern on the interference caused by `false' detection of spectrum holes. It is very much important to practically verify the advanced algorithms, theoretical frameworks for Cognitive radios both in terms of sensing and switching so as to ensure that the incumbent systems are fully convinced about its co-existence. Generally, performance evaluation of these algorithms is done using simulators, test beds and expensive protocol testers. While each of these has their own merits and demerits, we propose an architecture that combines the best of both simulators/emulators and real-time test beds for scaling up the experiments while keeping testing as realistic as possible with the harsh wireless environments.

This technique utilizes the notion of relay, as an intermediate node between the source and the destination, to enhance the overall system performance. In this paper we explored the benefits of adaptive cooperation, in which the relay adapts its relaying process in response to channel conditions and type of data priorities. In this paper, we propose to use the exponential effective signal to noise (SNR) mapping (EESM) technique to estimate the packet error rate (PER) at the relay node. Once estimated, the PER is then used to adapt the resource allocation process at the medium access control (MAC) layer according to different data priorities required by the destinations. We show that by using a new adaptive resource allocation technique in combination with the cross layer design approach, we can achieve real-time data constraints with no additional overhead.

It is demonstrated by simulation that these adaptive detectors are robust against subspace estimation error and can effectively suppress both MAI and ISI and converge to the optimum SINR.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345373","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive multiuser detection for CDMA frequency-selective fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive multiuser detection for CDMA frequency-selective fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345373/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003306","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive multiuser detection for CDMA frequency-selective fading channels","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569234237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098204S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345375,"authors":[{"name":"Changqing Luo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Changqing Luo","id":"37405532600"},{"name":"F.

The TCP throughput optimization is achieved by a two step process. First, we select a channel to maximize the spectrum utilization by reducing the probability of collision with primary users. Secondly, for an available and accessed channel, a cross-layer approach is proposed to improve TCP throughput which adaptively adjusts the modulation and coding scheme/frame size based on the observed channel gain. Simulation results show that the TCP throughput can be improved substantially compared with the existing approach that maximizes physical layer throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345375","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345375.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345375","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCP-aware cross-layer design in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"TCP-aware cross-layer design in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345375/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003308","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCP-aware cross-layer design in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569234507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059554S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345377,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper we recall a technique to mitigate ICI by splitting equalization at the receiver in two parts. A first pre-equalizer operates on sub-blocks of the received OFDM block with the aim of minimizing ICI, while a second, conventional equalizer adjusts phases on a per-subcarrier basis after OFDM demodulation. Moreover, we propose an estimation of channel parameters needed for equalization based on a superimposed pseudo-noise (PN) sequence method. Performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated for a possible extension of the new digital video broadcasting DVB-T2 standard to an handheld version (DVB-NGH). We show that bit error rate targets after channel decoding can be met at up to twice the speed of a conventional OFDM receiver, depending on channel dispersion.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345377.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Per sub-block equalization and channel estimation for next generation handheld DVB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Per sub-block equalization and channel estimation for next generation handheld DVB","htmlLink":"/document/5345377/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11003310","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per sub-block equalization and channel estimation for next generation handheld DVB","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569234647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070319S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5345387,"authors":[{"name":"Rehoboam Radzokota","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Rehoboam","lastName":"Radzokota","id":"37680658300"},{"name":"Eugene Golovins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Golovins","id":"37403639700"},{"name":"Neco Ventura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Neco","lastName":"Ventura","id":"37297116200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345387","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","OFDM","Interference cancellation","Cities and towns","Fading","Bit error rate","Quality of service","System performance","Africa"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","quality of service","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","interference cancellation","linear estimator","Rayleigh fading channel","bit error rate","BER","quality of service","QoS","Kronecker and Weichselberger channel model","regularization","linear detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit Error Rate (BER)","ill-conditioned channels","interference cancellation","linear detectors","Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","spatially correlated channels"]}],"abstract":"This work investigates the performance of interference cancellation based detectors in MIMO OFDM systems.

Receivers based on conventional estimation techniques that assume time-invariant channel for one OFDM symbol has error floor for high mobility cases. In this paper we present two-dimensional (2D) pilot-symbol assisted channel estimation for wireless OFDM . This linear interpolation algorithm has the advantage of minimizing the system complexity and processing delay while giving a good approximation to real mobile channel. The performance of the 2D frequency domain estimation algorithm is compared to coherent modulation with perfect channel estimation as well as other conventional methods. We also investigate the performance of proposed channel estimation for different detection techniques.

The traditional monolithic high performance computing paradigm is not suitable to achieve these requisites. The emerging Cloud Computing represents a valuable answer to these requirements. In fact, in this model the business buy computing time from commercial providers, allowing to dramatically decrease the investments in own data centers. Nevertheless, this paradigm often imposes constraints related to underlying infrastructure, forcing Enterprises to rethink their application architectures. Inspired by Amazon's EC2 model, we propose a system which allows Enterprises to extend their business networks within any Cloud infrastructure, creating custom virtual environments able to run the applications without any change, but responding always to the business companies typical requirements: Quality of Service, High- Availability and Security.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345440","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual business networks with Cloud Computing and virtual machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345440/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual business networks with Cloud Computing and virtual machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003373","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345440/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual business networks with Cloud Computing and virtual machines","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569232029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063021S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5345444,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar","affiliation":["Telef\u00f2nica Research and Development, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando L\u00f3pez","lastName":"Aguilar","id":"37667028700"},{"name":"Gorka Rubio Cidre","affiliation":["Telef\u00f2nica Research and Development, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Gorka Rubio","lastName":"Cidre","id":"37680627000"},{"name":"Javier Regidor Par\u00eds","affiliation":["Telef\u00f2nica Research and Development, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier Regidor","lastName":"Par\u00eds","id":"37667222000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345444","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"abstract":"Link layer abstraction is crucial both the cross layer simulation and design and the interface to complete a system level simulator.

Offering precise quality of service (QoS) for multimedia transmission over sensor networks has not received significant attention. However offering some better QoS for wireless multimedia over sensor networks raises significant challenges. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Cross-Layer multi-channel QoS-MAC protocol to support energy-efficient, high throughput, and reliable data transmission in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSNs). Our proposed protocol use benefit of TDMA and CSMA/CA to adaptively assign channels and timeslots to active multimedia sensor nodes in clusters. Simulations show that the proposed system achieves the performance objectives of WMSNs with increased network throughput at the cost of a small control and energy overhead.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345446.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive Cross-Layer multichannel QoS-MAC protocol for cluster based wireless multimedia sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345446/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive Cross-Layer multichannel QoS-MAC protocol for cluster based wireless multimedia sensor networks","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003379","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive Cross-Layer multichannel QoS-MAC protocol for cluster based wireless multimedia sensor networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569232229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050218S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345453,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, the proposed novel low-complexity selective mapping (SLM) and partial transmit sequences (PTS) schemes are applicable to interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems for PAPR reduction. The basic idea is to explore the special structure of interleaved OFDMA, so as to reduce the complexity of PAPR reduction. Current PAPR reduction techniques can be combined with the proposed structure, SLM and PTS are combined for instance. Simulation results show that compared with traditional techniques, the proposed technique can gain the same PAPR reduction but with considerable complexity reduction. The new SLM interleaved OFDMA scheme reduces the computational complexity, while it shows almost the same performance of PAPR reduction as that of the conventional SLM interleaved OFDMA scheme, the new PTS proposed can reduce the complexity too. This method needs side information in the receptor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity PAPR reduction schemes using SLM and PTS approaches for interleaved OFDMA","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345462","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345462.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity PAPR reduction schemes using SLM and PTS approaches for interleaved OFDMA","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345462/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003395","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity PAPR reduction schemes using SLM and PTS approaches for interleaved OFDMA","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569231679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041603S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5345468,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Flizikowski","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Flizikowski","id":"37392845500"},{"name":"Rafal Kozik","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafal","lastName":"Kozik","id":"37392853600"},{"name":"Mateusz Majewski","affiliation":["ITTI Sp. z. o. o., Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Majewski","id":"37391790600"},{"name":"Marcin Przybyszewski","affiliation":["ITTI Sp. z. o. o., Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Przybyszewski","id":"37392853300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345468","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345468","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","WiMAX","Delay","Traffic control","Resource management","Microwave technology","Physical layer","Throughput","Costs","Telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","telecommunication congestion control","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard channel admission control schemes","IEEE 802.16","WiMAX","worldwide interoperability for microwave access","QoS level","wireless Internet access","base station","ns-2 module","Simulink","modified DHCAC","Da Vinci nb-LDPC codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connection admission control","guard channel","IEEE 802.16","integrated simulation environment","nb-LDPC"]}],"abstract":"WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) based upon the IEEE 802.16 standards is a promising technology for the \"last mile\" wireless Internet access.

Specifically, an analytical characterization of the transient regime of a training-based MIMO system over arbitrarily correlated channels is presented. No channel state information is assumed to be available at either the transmitter or the receiver side, so that the design of the optimal transmit and receive beamformers is necessarily based on a finite collection of samples observed during a training phase. The focus is on practical scenarios where the length of the training sequence is comparable in magnitude to the system size. In these situations, the performance of the MIMO system can be expected to suffer from a considerable degradation. In order to characterize the actual performance under the previous realistic conditions, a large-system performance analysis is proposed that builds upon some new results on the convergence of the eigenvectors of large information-plus-noise covariance matrices.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345479","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345479.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large system analysis of beamforming for MIMO systems with limited training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345479/","displayDocTitle":"Large system analysis of beamforming for MIMO systems with limited training","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003412","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345479/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large system analysis of beamforming for MIMO systems with limited training","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569231500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065031S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5345486,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mohammadi","affiliation":["K.N.

In a multi-user system, not all users may wish or be able to be involved in every transmission. However, idle users can be used as a relay node in each transmission when the system requires them. In this paper we propose a new multi-user MIMO cooperative communication protocol which combines block diagonalization (BD) with an amplify-and-forward cooperative Protocol. Comparing with related works we consider that each mobile station (MS) experiences co-channel interference (CCI) from other unassociated relay nodes. So the major concept behind the proposed scheme is to transform each MIMO relay channels into an equivalent block diagonal channel using BD, which removes CCI. First, Base station (BS) performs a selection phase and selects relays among idle users using the available channel state information in the mobile users and BS nodes. Next, BS at the first hop transmits a linear combination of the intended users' data to related relay nodes. Finally, at the second hop relays and BS transmit their own data to designated MS simultaneously. In order to achieve better diversity gain we utilize Space-Time Block codes in two transmission links, and each MS Combines the received signal of the two transmitters using maximal ratio combining (MRC). We compare our schemes' performance with direct noncooperative transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay selection for multiuser MIMO amplify-and-forward relaying systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345486","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345486.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Relay selection for multiuser MIMO amplify-and-forward relaying systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345486/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003419","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay selection for multiuser MIMO amplify-and-forward relaying systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569231373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059796S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5345487,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

In this work we modify DualCUSUM to develop GLR-CUSUM which can work with imprecise estimates of the channel gains. Next we extend the algorithm to the case where the receiver noise power is also not known exactly. We show that the SNR wall problem encountered in this scenario is not experienced by our algorithm.

It is shown that the proposed model may provide significantly better error performance compared to the conventional MB-OFDM at low SNR, but with complexity tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345509","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single parity check product code in MB-OFDM ultra wideband system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single parity check product code in MB-OFDM ultra wideband system","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003442","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single parity check product code in MB-OFDM ultra wideband system","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569231302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078832S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5345517,"authors":[{"name":"Chiara Buratti","affiliation":["WiLaboratory, DEIS, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Buratti","id":"37423420400"},{"name":"Alberto Zanella","affiliation":["WiLaboratory, IEIIT, National Research Council, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Zanella","id":"37269061800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345517","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Interference","Bandwidth","Relays","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Spread spectrum communication","Resource management","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","performance evaluation","probability","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel reuse","multi-hop virtual MIMO systems","radio resources","V-MIMO systems","virtual antenna array","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual MIMO","Capacity","Interferences","Poisson point process"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the impact of the reuse of radio resources on the performance of multi-hop virtual multiple-input-multiple-output (V-MIMO) systems is investigated.

Recently, such a paradigm has been called into question by a new approach, namely the opportunistic routing. It exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions to take advantage from spatial diversity by routing the packets according to the propagation conditions, i.e. by selecting the next hop at the receiver side. Although numerous opportunistic algorithms and protocols have been proposed in the last years, very few works have used an analytical approach to analyze the opportunistic routing behavior so as to provide a guideline for future protocol design. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to describe any routing procedures operating according to the opportunistic paradigm. It applies in a very general multi-hop scenario and is not restricted to any specific network topology or opportunistic protocol. The model requires the knowledge of both the delivery ratios and node priority, which is based on the adopted routing metric (expected transmission count (ETX), geographic distance, etc). In this paper we exploit such a model to derive a closed-form expression of the average number of data-link transmissions needed to successfully deliver a packet.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11003514","htmlLink":"/document/5345582/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical model for opportunistic routing in ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical model for opportunistic routing in ad hoc networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569229597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054592S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345599,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Masiero","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Masiero","id":"37320709200"},{"name":"Giorgio Quer","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Quer","id":"37320710500"},{"name":"Michele Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37271350900"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345599","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":667},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Wireless sensor networks","Principal component analysis","Image coding","Monitoring","Signal analysis","Statistical distributions","Image reconstruction","Image storage","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","maximum likelihood estimation","principal component analysis","signal reconstruction","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian analysis","compressive sensing data recovery","wireless sensor networks","distributed signal reconstruction","principal component analysis","nonstationary signals","data collection point","online estimation","spatial-temporal correlation structures","Bayesian estimation","optimal maximum a posteriori recovery"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we address the task of accurately reconstructing a distributed signal through the collection of a small number of samples at a data gathering point using compressive sensing (CS) in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). Our scheme compresses in a distributed way real world non-stationary signals, recovering them at the data collection point through the online estimation of their spatial/temporal correlation structures. The proposed technique is hereby characterized under the framework of Bayesian estimation, showing under which assumptions it is equivalent to optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) recovery. As the main contribution of this paper, we proceed with the analysis of data collected by our indoor wireless sensor network (WSN) testbed, proving that these assumptions hold with good accuracy in the considered real world scenarios. This provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our approach and proves that CS is a legitimate tool for the recovery of real-world signals in WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345599","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345599.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian analysis of Compressive Sensing data recovery in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345599/","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian analysis of Compressive Sensing data recovery in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003531","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345599/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian analysis of Compressive Sensing data recovery in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569229277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074578S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5345619,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Kwon Baek","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Kwon","lastName":"Baek","id":"37671004100"},{"name":"Jae-Su Song","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Su","lastName":"Song","id":"37673856400"},{"name":"Jin-up Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-up","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293482400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3942-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3941-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"}],"articleNumber":"5345619","dbTime":"48 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345619","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Fuzzy logic","Radio spectrum management","Resource management","Radio access networks","Utility theory","Mobile radio mobility management","Availability","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple attributes","multimode terminal","access system selection algorithm","multiattribute utility theory","heterogeneous cognitive radio network","user-centric intelligent mechanism","radio condition","vertical handover scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access System selection","Inter-system handover","Mobility management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345619","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345619.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive access selection with multple attributes in cognitive radio network","abstract":"In future wireless networks, the users will have the capability to access to multiple networks via multi-mode terminal. There is a need to have mechanism in place to decide which radio access network is the most suitable for the user and for the services that the user requires. To address these issues, we propose an access system(AS) selection algorithm, based on a combination of multi-attribute utility theory, in cognitive radio network. In order to achieve the proposal, we propose the system architecture and AS selection scheme for heterogeneous cognitive radio network. Our AS selection scheme is user-centric intelligent mechanism by introducing the utility functions with various parameters such as radio condition, load of each access system, mobility pattern of user and preference. The experimental result shows proposed AS selection scheme results in better performance than traditional vertical handover scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345619/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11003548","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345619/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive access selection with multple attributes in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive access selection with multple attributes in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569228381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085932S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5345620,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Quality of service issues have to be addressed in these systems in the presence of multipath fading. This is especially the case when the number of users in the secondary system grow. Multi-user resource scheduling is critical to mitigate the issue. In this work, we consider scheduling for dynamic spectrum access in a combination of underlay and overlay frequency bands. A subchannel allocation algorithm is proposed for fixed data rate provisioning. Numerical results are shown for performance of the algorithm for arbitrary number of users. Measured channels are used for the simulations to validate real-time application. The results show that the performance gain with joint scheduling in overlay and underlay bands is significant.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345620","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subchannel allocation for dynamic spectrum access in underlay OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subchannel allocation for dynamic spectrum access in underlay OFDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345620/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003549","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subchannel allocation for dynamic spectrum access in underlay OFDMA system","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569228384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091232S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345624,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This paper presents an adaptive and complexity reduced decoding algorithm for CCs. The proposed algorithm is based on the earlier proposed block syndrome decoder (BSD) and features a significant reduction of decoding effort depending on the current channel conditions. Additionally it is capable of adapting its output bit error rate to a given threshold to achieve a further reduction of decoding complexity. For this purpose, an SNR estimation is incorporated to achieve an adaption of decoding performance to a given bit error rate threshold in dynamic SNR environments. This is especially useful for the widely used serially concatenated coding schemes, which is demonstrated by means of the terrestrial DVB system.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345627","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345627.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345627","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive and complexity reduced decoding algorithm for convolutional codes and its application to digital broadcasting systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive and complexity reduced decoding algorithm for convolutional codes and its application to digital broadcasting systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345627/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11003556","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive and complexity reduced decoding algorithm for convolutional codes and its application to digital broadcasting systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569228955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071899S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5345645,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

In such systems, the performance of the conventional single-user detection technique (i.e. a rake receiver compounded by a set of matched filters) is clearly bounded by the well-known multiple access interference (MAI). To avoid this limitation, the optimum maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme seeks the best solution by performing an exhaustive search over the entire set of N-dimensional information vectors, which entails a computational complexity exponentially increasing with the number of nodes N. The heuristic procedure presented in this manuscript provides a set of near-optimum candidate vectors at a dramatically lower computational complexity. Intensive computer simulations show that our heuristic proposal outperforms the conventional single-user rake receiver, while getting close to the optimum albeit complex ML detector.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications &

Theoretical analysis shows that the detected data symbol at the receiver consists of attenuated version of the original transmitted data symbol, third and fifth order intermodulation (IM) components. Analytical expressions for intermodulation noise term are derived using combinatorial methods. By use of the derived expressions, a closed form output signal to noise ratio, degradation factor (DF) and probability of error can be evaluated theoretically. For verifying the accuracy of our analysis a comparison between the theoretical and simulated results for one actual HPA are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345661","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340227/5345316/05345661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345316","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance degradation of OFDM signals passing through nonlinear circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance degradation of OFDM signals passing through nonlinear circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345661/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003590","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance degradation of OFDM signals passing through nonlinear circuits","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"1569226633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090636S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340227","isNumber":"5345316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340227","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345316","articleId":"5345661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5345682,"authors":[{"name":"Eonpyo Hong","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechatronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eonpyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37408571800"},{"name":"Dongsoo Har","affiliation":["School of Information and Mechatronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongsoo","lastName":"Har","id":"37282432300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5345682","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Filters","Computational complexity","Wireless LAN","Fast Fourier transforms","Frequency division multiplexing","Digital video broadcasting","Nonlinear distortion","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-pass filters","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-to-average power ratio reduction","OFDM system","all-pass filters","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","phase rotation","selected mapping scheme","inverse fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","selected mapping (SLM)"]}],"abstract":"A low-complexity peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed.

An Expectation-Maximization-Bayesian tracking scheme is proposed and implemented among slave, master, and host modules of a prototype system. Information fusion schemes are developed to improve the system identification performance for both individuals and multiple subjects. The fusion of thermal gait biometric information measured by multiple nodes is tested at four levels: sample, feature, score, and decision. Experimentally, the prototype system is able to simultaneously track two individuals in both follow-up and crossover scenarios with average tracking errors less than 0.5 m. The experimental results also demonstrate system's potential to be a reliable biometric system for the verification/identification of a small group of human subjects. The developed wireless distributed infrared sensor system can run as a standalone prisoner/patient monitoring system under any illumination conditions, as well as a complement for conventional video and audio human tracking and identification systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Wireless sensor networks","Pyroelectricity","Sensor systems","Biosensors","Infrared sensors","Sensor arrays","Biometrics","Thermal sensors","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","distributed sensors","expectation-maximisation algorithm","monitoring","optical sensors","optical tracking","pyroelectric detectors","sensor fusion","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple human tracking","wireless distributed pyroelectric sensor system","body heat radiation","infrared video sensors","sensor field of view","Fresnel lens arrays","sensor deployment","data object association","expectation-maximization Bayesian tracking","information fusion","thermal gait biometric information","biometric system","wireless distributed infrared sensor","prisoner monitoring","patient monitoring","illumination conditions","video tracking","audio human tracking","identification system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple human tracking","walker identification","pyroelectric sensor","wireless sensor network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2009.2035734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5394076/05345683.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2009.2035734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Human Tracking and Identification With Wireless Distributed Pyroelectric Sensor Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Human Tracking and Identification With Wireless Distributed Pyroelectric Sensor Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345683/","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345683/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11088193","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Human Tracking and Identification With Wireless Distributed Pyroelectric Sensor Systems","sourcePdf":"03jsyst04-qhao-2035734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09802S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5394076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5394076","articleId":"5345683","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5345690,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Matar","affiliation":["Energy Systems Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Center for Applied Power Electronics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5437451/5345690/5345690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahmoud Matar (S'00) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada in 2009.","Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Center for Applied Power Electronics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto.

The salient features of the proposed implementation are: 1) It eliminates the need for corrective measures to reduce error due to the lack of synchronization between the simulation time-grid and output signals of the control/protection platform; 2) it provides scalability, that is, it maintains calculation time, within each simulation time step, nearly fixed irrespective of the system size; and 3) it enables the use of a small simulation timestep, for example, a couple of hundreds of nanoseconds for the overall system, in contrast to the microseconds range time-steps used in the existing simulators. Thus, it is also able to provide a wide frequency bandwidth for the simulation results. This paper also reports the implementation results and their verifications corresponding to real-time simulation of two converter units based on less than 60-ns calculation time within each simulation time step.

In a long-term context, planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak demand levels. Therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting uncertainty. This paper proposes a new methodology to forecast the density of long-term peak electricity demand. Peak electricity demand in a given season is subject to a range of uncertainties, including underlying population growth, changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual usage. It is also subject to some known calendar effects due to the time of day, day of week, time of year, and public holidays. A comprehensive forecasting solution is described in this paper. First, semi-parametric additive models are used to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables, including temperatures, calendar effects and some demographic and economic variables. Then the demand distributions are forecasted by using a mixture of temperature simulation, assumed future economic scenarios, and residual bootstrapping. The temperature simulation is implemented through a new seasonal bootstrapping method with variable blocks. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the probability distribution of annual and weekly peak electricity demand for South Australia since 2007. The performance of the methodology is evaluated by comparing the forecast results with the actual demand of the summer 2007-2008.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345698/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256752","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5345698/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Density Forecasting for Long-Term Peak Electricity Demand","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density Forecasting for Long-Term Peak Electricity Demand","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-fan-2036017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052103S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5452108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"5452108","articleId":"5345698","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5345699,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5371895/5345699/5345699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from Northeast Dianli University of China, Jilin City, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Postdoctoral Fellow for two years.

Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters.

The assumption on the availability of UAV dynamics is not always practical, especially in an outdoor environment. Therefore, in this work, an NN is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV online, including uncertain nonlinear terms like aerodynamic friction and blade flapping. Although a quadrotor UAV is underactuated, a novel NN virtual control input scheme is proposed which allows all six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the UAV to be controlled using only four control inputs. Furthermore, an NN observer is introduced to estimate the translational and angular velocities of the UAV, and an output feedback control law is developed in which only the position and the attitude of the UAV are considered measurable. It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the position, orientation, and velocity tracking errors, the virtual control and observer estimation errors, and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are all semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors while simultaneously relaxing the separation principle. The effectiveness of proposed output feedback control scheme is then demonstrated in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and simulation results are included to demonstrate the theoretical conjecture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Neural networks","Aerodynamics","Vehicle dynamics","Error correction","Estimation error","Friction","Blades","Angular velocity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","feedback","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output feedback","quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle","nonlinear control","neural networks","aerodynamic friction","blade flapping","NN virtual control input scheme","NN observer","angular velocity control","translational velocity control","Lyapunov theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lyapunov method","neural network (NN)","observer","output feedback","quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biomechanics","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Systems Theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345702","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2034145","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5371895/05345702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2034145","startPage":"50","endPage":"66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output Feedback Control of a Quadrotor UAV Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Output Feedback Control of a Quadrotor UAV Using Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5345702/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037353","pubMedId":"19963698","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output Feedback Control of a Quadrotor UAV Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-tdierks-2034145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078106S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5371895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"347","xplore-issue":"5371895","articleId":"5345702","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5345703,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Bouguila","affiliation":["Concordia Institute of Information Systems Engineering (CIISE), Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5371895/5345703/5345703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nizar Bouguila (S'05\u2013M'06) received the engineer degree from the University of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2000 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Sherbrooke University, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, in 2002 and 2006, respectively, all in computer science.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE), Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada.

This clustering algorithm does not require the specification of the number of mixture components to be given in advance and estimates it in a principled manner. Our approach is Bayesian and relies on the estimation of the posterior distribution of clusterings using Gibbs sampler. Through some applications involving real-data classification and image databases categorization using visual words, we show that clustering via infinite mixture models offers a more powerful and robust performance than classic finite mixtures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5371895/05345703.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2034851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2034851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dirichlet Process Mixture of Generalized Dirichlet Distributions for Proportional Data Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Clustering algorithms","Image databases","Data analysis","Robustness","Image sampling","Image analysis","Machine learning","Computer vision","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","boundary-value problems","data models","pattern clustering","statistical distributions","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dirichlet process mixture","Dirichlet distribution","proportional data modeling","clustering algorithm","finite generalized Dirichlet mixture model","nonparametric Bayesian analysis","clusterings posterior distribution","Gibbs sampler","image databases categorization","visual words application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data classification","Dirichlet processes","generalized Dirichlet distribution","Gibbs sampling","image database categorization","MCMC","Metropolis\u2013Hastings (M\u2013H)","mixture modeling","nonparametric Bayesian analysis","proportional data"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Bayes Theorem","Cluster Analysis","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Statistical"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Dirichlet Process Mixture of Generalized Dirichlet Distributions for Proportional Data Modeling","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5345703/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037354","pubMedId":"19963696","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dirichlet Process Mixture of Generalized Dirichlet Distributions for Proportional Data Modeling","sourcePdf":"tnn-nbouguila-2034851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162215S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5371895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5371895","articleId":"5345703","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345708,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The first attempts to automate power line inspection were conducted in the field of helicopter inspection. In recent years, however, the research was mostly focused on flying and climbing robots. These two types of robots for automated power line inspection are critically assessed according to four important characteristics: design requirements, inspection quality, autonomy and universality of inspection. Besides, some general not yet identified problems and tasks of inspection robots, which should be addressed in the future, are presented. In conclusion, the two robot types have specific benefits and drawbacks so that none can currently be considered generally advantageous. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2035427","startPage":"485","endPage":"493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2035427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5361446/05345712.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Mobile Robots for Distribution Power Line Inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345712/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Mobile Robots for Distribution Power Line Inspection","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5345712/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11024934","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Mobile Robots for Distribution Power Line Inspection","sourcePdf":"25tpwrd01-jkatrasnik-2035427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071149S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5361446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5361446","articleId":"5345712","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5345720,"authors":[{"name":"Farid Khoucha","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Polytechnic Military Academy, Algiers, Algeria","Laboratoire Brestois de M\u00e9canique et des Syst\u00e8mes (EA 4325), University of Brest, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Khoucha","id":"37274793200"},{"name":"Soumia Mouna Lagoun","affiliation":["University of Laghouat, Laghouat, Algeria","Laboratoire Brestois de M\u00e9canique et des Syst\u00e8mes (EA 4325), University of Brest, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Soumia Mouna","lastName":"Lagoun","id":"37680406300"},{"name":"Khoudir Marouani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Polytechnic Military Academy, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Khoudir","lastName":"Marouani","id":"37274790100"},{"name":"Abdelaziz Kheloui","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Polytechnic Military Academy, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Kheloui","id":"37274794300"},{"name":"Mohamed El Hachemi Benbouzid","affiliation":["Laboratoire Brestois de M\u00e9canique et des Syst\u00e8mes (EA 4325), University of Brest, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed El Hachemi","lastName":"Benbouzid","id":"37293737500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"5345720","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":168,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4901},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Automotive applications","Inverters","Motor drives","Stators","Hybrid electric vehicles","Error correction","Voltage control","DC generators","Hybrid power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","hybrid electric vehicles","induction motor drives","invertors","machine control","stators","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel-inverter","induction motor drives","direct torque control","hybrid electric vehicles","stator voltage vector reference","stator flux"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automotive application","direct torque control (DTC)","induction motor","multilevel inverters"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel motor drive direct torque control (DTC) scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid EVs. The control method is based on DTC operating principles. The stator voltage vector reference is computed from the stator flux and torque errors imposed by the flux and torque controllers. This voltage reference is then generated using a hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter, where each phase of the inverter can be implemented using a dc source, which would be available from fuel cells, batteries, or ultracapacitors. This inverter provides nearly sinusoidal voltages with very low distortion, even without filtering, using fewer switching devices. In addition, the multilevel inverter can generate a high and fixed switching frequency output voltage with fewer switching losses, since only the small power cells of the inverter operate at a high switching rate. Therefore, a high performance and also efficient torque and flux controllers are obtained, enabling a DTC solution for multilevel-inverter-powered motor drives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel-Inverter Induction-Motor-Drive Direct Torque Control for Automotive Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037105","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05345720.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel-Inverter Induction-Motor-Drive Direct Torque Control for Automotive Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11119934","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel-Inverter Induction-Motor-Drive Direct Torque Control for Automotive Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-benbouzid-2037105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111279S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"168","articleId":"5345720","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5345721,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5545545/5345721/5345721-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuo Wang (S'03\u2013M'06\u2013SM'07) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 1994, the M.S.E.E. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, in 2005.","He has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at San Antonio since 2010.

The circuit operates stand-alone, and it extracts the piezoelectric strain energy independent of the load and piezoelectric parameters without using any external sensor. The circuit consists of a voltage-doubler rectifier, a step-down switching converter, and an analog controller operating with a single supply voltage in the range of 2.5-15 V. The controller uses the piezoelectric voltage as a feedback and regulates the rectified voltage to adaptively improve the extracted power. The nonscalable power dissipation of the controller unit is less than 0.05 mW, and the efficiency of the circuit is about 60% for output power levels above 0.5 mW. Experimental verifications of the circuit show the following: 1) the circuit notably increases the extracted power from a piezoelectric element compared to a simple full-bridge diode rectifier without control circuitry, and 2) the efficiency of the circuit is dominantly determined by its switching converter. The simplicity of the circuit facilitates the development of efficient piezoelectric energy harvesters for low-power applications such as wireless sensors and portable devices.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Power Stand-Alone Adaptive Circuit for Harvesting Energy From a Piezoelectric Micropower Generator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05345727.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power Stand-Alone Adaptive Circuit for Harvesting Energy From a Piezoelectric Micropower Generator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5345727/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11119943","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power Stand-Alone Adaptive Circuit for Harvesting Energy From a Piezoelectric Micropower Generator","sourcePdf":"tie-tabesh-2037648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072027S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5345727","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5345728,"authors":[{"name":"Ondrej Linda","affiliation":["University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5345728/5345728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ondrej Linda received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering and informatics from Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic, in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, in 2009, where is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He was an Intern with the Robotics Group, Idaho National Laboratory, and has held Research Assistant positions with Kansas State University and the University of Idaho.

Here, the commonly provided audio-visual feedback often resulted in an inadequate perception of the remote environment. Haptic augmentation was shown to improve and positively enhance the control of the mobile robot. This paper presents novel self-organizing fuzzy adaptive mapping algorithm (SOFAMap) for a haptic teleoperation of mobile robots. The SOFAMap algorithm was specifically developed for a mobile robot with a rotational sonar sensory system, constituting an alternative to a traditionally used multisonar array. The main contributions of this paper are the following: 1) development of a specific self-organizing environment mapping structure inspired by the growing neural gas algorithm; 2) incorporating a fuzzy controller into the algorithm to adapt to robot's motion; and 3) resolving typical issues such as sensor noise, communication time delay, and low sampling rate. The experimental testing was performed in both virtual environment and on a real robotic platform, consisting of a Lego NXT mobile robot and a Novint Falcon 3-DOF haptic interface. The results showed that a high-fidelity haptic feedback can be successfully generated using a simpler and more affordable rotational sonar sensory system, as opposed to the typical multisonar array. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the SOFAMap algorithm improves the operator's awareness of unstructured environments, making it applicable to wide range of mobile robot teleoperation systems.","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5947747/05345728.pdf","startPage":"3187","endPage":"3195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5947747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037649","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037649","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345728","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Haptic interfaces","Mobile robots","Sonar","Sensor arrays","Robotics and automation","Explosives","Radioactive pollution","Freight handling","Transportation","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","delays","feedback","fuzzy control","haptic interfaces","mobile robots","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing fuzzy haptic teleoperation","sparse sonar data","industrial automation","explosives disposal","nuclear waste manipulation","freight handling","transportation","audiovisual feedback","self-organizing fuzzy adaptive mapping algorithm","rotational sonar sensory system","multisonar array","self-organizing environment mapping structure","fuzzy controller","neural gas algorithm","sensor noise","communication time delay","low sampling rate","virtual environment","Lego NXT mobile robot","Novint Falcon 3-DOF haptic interface","high-fidelity haptic feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy control","growing neural gas (GNG)","haptic interface","mobile robot teleoperation","self-organization","sonar sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Self-Organizing Fuzzy Haptic Teleoperation of Mobile Robot Using Sparse Sonar Data","accessionNumber":"12157669","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5345728/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Organizing Fuzzy Haptic Teleoperation of Mobile Robot Using Sparse Sonar Data","sourcePdf":"tie-manic-2037649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065821S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5947747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5947747","articleId":"5345728","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5345729,"authors":[{"name":"Quy Ngoc Le","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5545545/5345729/5345729-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quy Ngoc Le was born in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Staircase membership functions are introduced to facilitate the stability analysis. Through the staircase membership functions approximating those of the fuzzy model and fuzzy controller, the information of the membership functions can be brought into the stability analysis. Based on the Lyapunov-stability theory, stability conditions in terms of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived in a simple and easy-to-understand manner to guarantee the system stability. The proposed stability-analysis approach offers a nice property that includes the membership functions of both fuzzy model and fuzzy controller in the LMI-based stability conditions for a dedicated FMB control system. Furthermore, the proposed stability-analysis approach can be applied to the FMB control systems of which the membership functions of both fuzzy model and fuzzy controller are not necessarily the same. Greater design flexibility is allowed to choose the membership functions during the design of fuzzy controllers. By employing membership functions with simple structure, it is possible to lower the structural complexity and the implementation cost. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the merits of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratic-Stability Analysis of Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems Using Staircase Membership Functions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2037744","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5405632/05345734.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2037744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405632","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Quadratic-Stability Analysis of Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems Using Staircase Membership Functions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5345734/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11137443","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratic-Stability Analysis of Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Systems Using Staircase Membership Functions","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lam-2037744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0778S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5405632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5405632","articleId":"5345734","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345735,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Asghari","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), University of Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Asghari","id":"37542196600"},{"name":"Daniel Benevides da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel Benevides","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), University of Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5345735","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":567},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Time of arrival estimation","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Diversity reception","Closed-form solution","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Nakagami distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","Gaussian processes","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol error probability","rectangular QAM","MRC systems","SEP","arbitrary m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","maximal-ratio combining","MRC schemes","moment-generating function","MGF","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","Gaussian components","Lauricella multivariate hypergeometric functions","numerical softwares","Mathematica","analytical expressions","Monte Carlo simulations","correlated \u03b7-\u03bc fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlated channels","maximal-ratio combining (MRC)","rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)","symbol error probability (SEP)","$\\eta$\u2013$\\mu$  fading"]}],"abstract":"In the context of \u03b7- \u03bc generalized fading scenarios, this paper provides a general closed-form expression for the average symbol error probability (SEP) of arbitrary \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations in maximal-ratio combining (MRC) schemes over non-identical correlated channels.

In this paper, a novel channel-estimation and data-detection method for OFDM systems over the fast-fading dispersive channels has been proposed and investigated. A new pilot pattern is also proposed, and it is composed of a comb-type pilot pattern and a grouped pilot pattern. The required number of pilot subcarriers is, therefore, significantly reduced compared with that of using the grouped pilot pattern only. We present the MSE analysis of the proposed channel estimation based on the proposed pilot pattern and thoroughly investigate the MSE performance of channel estimation by a numerical method. A closed-form mathematical expression has been derived to express the MSE of the proposed channel estimation as a function of the Doppler shift, the number of resolvable paths of the channel, the polynomial order, and so on. Both computer simulation and numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation and data detection based on the proposed pilot pattern have effectively eliminated the ICI in terms of the MSE of the channel estimation and bit-error-rate (BER) performance, whereas the required pilot number per OFDM symbol is reduced by about 92.3% in comparison with that of using the grouped and equispaced pilot pattern.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05345736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Systems Over Fast-Fading and Dispersive Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Systems Over Fast-Fading and Dispersive Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177534","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5345736/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Systems Over Fast-Fading and Dispersive Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2037639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094451S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5345736","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345737,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro M.

In this paper, a new voltage compensation scheme for high-voltage-based (> 100 V) energy harvesting is introduced, and its fundamental concepts, as well as the operation details, are elaborated. This scheme, when applied to the voltage inversion method [synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI)], provides an increase of over 14% in harvested power when compared to the parallel inversion method (parallel SSHI) alone and more than 50% in the case of series inversion method (series SSHI). Second, tapered cantilever beams were shown to be more effective in generating a uniform strain profile over rectangular and trapezoidal beams if they are precisely shaped, resulting in a significant increase in harvested power over available methods in the literature from laboratory experimental tests. In addition, a simplified method to design such a beam is introduced. Finally, a field test of the proposed tapered beam is conducted by using a dozer for earth-moving applications, and experimental results are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting From Vibration With Alternate Scavenging Circuitry and Tapered Cantilever Beam","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05345740.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting From Vibration With Alternate Scavenging Circuitry and Tapered Cantilever Beam","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5345740/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11137553","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting From Vibration With Alternate Scavenging Circuitry and Tapered Cantilever Beam","sourcePdf":"tie-mehraeen-2037652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078241S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5345740","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5345742,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Vasconcelos Araujo","affiliation":["Center of Competence of Distributed Electric Power Technology (KDEE), University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5545545/5345742/5345742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samuel Vasconcelos Ara\u00fajo (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in renewable energies and energy efficiency (RE2) from the University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany, in 2007.

One significant advance, among some that will be here discussed is, for example, the abolition of the galvanic isolation in inverters installed in Germany. There, transformerless topologies, like the H5 and Heric, can reach very high levels of efficiency and allow the best cost-benefit ratio for low-power grid-tied systems. This paper will follow this direction and propose a single-phase transformerless inverter circuit being composed of the association of two step-down converters. Each one modulates a half-wave of the output current, as the correct polarity of the connection to the grid is provided by low-frequency switches. Due to its straightforward design, reduced amount of semiconductors, and simple operation, it is possible to achieve a high level of efficiency and reliability. These and some other characteristics will be benchmarked against other existing circuits, being followed by a theoretical analysis on the properties of the proposed solution. The project of a laboratory prototype will be presented, along with a discussion about the obtained experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient Single-Phase Transformerless Inverters for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2037654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5545545/05345742.pdf","startPage":"3118","endPage":"3128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2037654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5545545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient Single-Phase Transformerless Inverters for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5345742/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11464221","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient Single-Phase Transformerless Inverters for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-araujo-2037654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125247S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5545545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"415","xplore-issue":"5545545","articleId":"5345742","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5345745,"authors":[{"name":"Golnaz Farhadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Golnaz","lastName":"Farhadi","id":"37296980200"},{"name":"Norman C.

However, with the significant increase in problem size, computational efficiency is critical to making 3D microwave imaging viable in practice. In this paper, we present two 3D image reconstruction methods utilizing 3D scalar and vector field modeling strategies, respectively. Finite element (FE) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithms are used to model the electromagnetic field interactions in human tissue in 3D. Image reconstruction techniques previously developed for the 2D problem, such as the dual-mesh scheme, iterative block solver, and adjoint Jacobian method are extended directly to 3D reconstructions. Speed improvements achieved by setting an initial field distribution and utilizing an alternating-direction implicit (ADI) FDTD are explored for 3D vector field modeling. The proposed algorithms are tested with simulated data and correctly recovered the position, size and electrical properties of the target. The adjoint formulation and the FDTD method utilizing initial field estimates are found to be significantly more effective in reducing the computation time. Finally, these results also demonstrate that cross-plane measurements are critical for reconstructing 3D profiles of the target.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2037691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5405121/05345747.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2037691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405121","startPage":"449","endPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Viable Three-Dimensional Medical Microwave Tomography: Theory and Numerical Experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Viable Three-Dimensional Medical Microwave Tomography: Theory and Numerical Experiments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118398","pubMedId":"20352084","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5345747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viable Three-Dimensional Medical Microwave Tomography: Theory and Numerical Experiments","sourcePdf":"tap-fang-2037691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096521S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5405121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5405121","articleId":"5345747","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345749,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Chan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Communications Engineering, and Center of Telecommunication Research, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5405121/5345749/5345749-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Chan Chang (S'99\u2013M'04) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1995, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at Davis (UCD), CA, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.","She was a full-time Teaching Assistant with the Department of Electronics Engineering at National Chiao-Tung University from 1995 to 1997.

This paper reviews recent state-of-the-art research on the enabling technologies needed to realize future WDM-PON and WDM/TDM-PON systems, and discusses future directions toward practical PON systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5594752/05345772.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2035640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2035640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Technologies for Future Scalable and Flexible WDM-PON and WDM/TDM-PON Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Passive optical networks","Optical network units","WDM networks","Optical fiber networks","Time division multiplexing","Optical fiber subscriber loops","Next generation networking","Explosions","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre subscriber loops","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WDM-TDM-PON system","wavelength division multiplexing","next generation scalable passive optical networks","optical network unit","optical line terminal","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communication","optical subscriber loops","passive optical networks","wavelength-division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Technologies for Future Scalable and Flexible WDM-PON and WDM/TDM-PON Systems","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5345772/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560860","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Technologies for Future Scalable and Flexible WDM-PON and WDM/TDM-PON Systems","sourcePdf":"jstqe-kani-2035640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078119S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5594752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5594752","articleId":"5345772","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345776,"authors":[{"name":"James C.

Statistics indicate that the primary cause of most road accidents is vehicles' excessive speed and delayed drivers reaction. Thus, road safety can be improved by early warning based on V2V communication. An innovative system called wireless local danger warning (WILLWARN), which is based on recent and future trends of cooperative driving, enables an electronic safety horizon for foresighted driving by implementing onboard vehicle-hazard detection and V2V communication. One of the key innovative features of the proposed system is the focus on low penetration levels in rural traffic by a new message-management strategy that is based on storing warning information in the vehicle and distributing warnings through communication, particularly with oncoming traffic. The system timely warns the driver about a dangerous situation ahead by decentralized distribution of warnings and incident messages via ad hoc intervehicle communication. The WILLWARN system is based on a modular object-oriented architecture consisting of the V2V communication module (VVC), the warning message-management module (WMM), the hazard-detection-management module (HDM), the hazard-warning-management module (HWM), a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and various onboard sensors.

The proposed DWT processor conforms to dual-line scanning to remove the transpose buffer. In the previous single-line DWT architectures, the transpose buffer size is proportional to the row size of the image. The conventional dual-line DWT architecture is constructed by using the convolution-based filter structure and replicates registers to alternatively deal with two lines, resulting in a long delay, as well as a number of operators and registers. The proposed architecture is based on the lifting-based DWT to embed the additional registers in the middle of the DWT operation. In addition, the computation topology is optimized for the proposed dual-line DWT architecture to achieve almost the same hardware cost and critical path as the single-line DWT architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2035257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5353851/05345791.pdf","startPage":"916","endPage":"920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2035257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Discrete Wavelet Transform Architecture Scanning Dual Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345791/","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Discrete Wavelet Transform Architecture Scanning Dual Lines","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11020364","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345791/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Discrete Wavelet Transform Architecture Scanning Dual Lines","sourcePdf":"tcsii-park-2035257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057395S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5353851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5353851","articleId":"5345791","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345793,"authors":[{"name":"Sanming Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Positioning and Wireless Technology Centre, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5405121/5345793/5345793-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanming Hu (S'07) was born in Tongcheng, Hubei, China.

The derivation of discrete difference operators for the ADE-CPML equations for FDTD is also presented. The ADE-CPML method is also extended in a compact form to a multiple-pole PML formulation. The advantage of the ADE-CPML method is that it provides a more flexible representation that can be extended to higher-order methods. In this paper, it is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin finite element time-domain (DGFETD) method. It is demonstrated that the ADE-CPML maintains the exponential convergence of the DGFETD method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5423254/05345799.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2037765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2037765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Auxiliary Differential Equation Formulation for the Complex-Frequency Shifted PML","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Differential equations","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Perfectly matched layers","Finite element methods","Frequency","Moment methods","Reflection","Maxwell equations","Difference equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing media","convergence of numerical methods","differential equations","electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave polarisation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Galerkin method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auxiliary differential equation formulation","complex-frequency shifted PML","complex frequency shifted perfectly matched layer absorbing media","stretched coordinate PML formulation","Roden convolutional PML method","FDTD","discrete difference operators","higher-order methods","discontinuous Galerkin finite element time-domain method","exponential convergence","wave polarization","unit step response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorbing boundary conditions","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","finite element methods","perfectly matched layer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Auxiliary Differential Equation Formulation for the Complex-Frequency Shifted PML","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11152792","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Auxiliary Differential Equation Formulation for the Complex-Frequency Shifted PML","sourcePdf":"tap-sgedney-2037765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04137S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5423254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"79","articleId":"5345799","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345801,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410625/5345801/5345801-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Lei received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2009.","In 2008, she joined the Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University, as a Research Associate.

Each subarray is assumed to be well calibrated, so that the steering vectors of all subarrays are exactly known. However, the intersubarray gain and/or phase mismatches are known imperfectly or remain completely unknown. Our first approach is based on a worst-case beamformer design which, in contrast to the existing worst-case designs, exploits a specific structured ellipsoidal uncertainty model for the signal steering vector rather than the commonly used unstructured uncertainty models. Our second approach is based on estimating the unknown intersubarray parameters by maximizing the output power of the minimum variance beamformer subject to a proper constraint that helps to avoid trivial solution of the resulting optimization problem. Different modifications of the second approach are developed for the cases of gain-and-phase and phase-only intersubarray distortions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11105829","htmlLink":"/document/5345801/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming in Partly Calibrated Sparse Sensor Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming in Partly Calibrated Sparse Sensor Arrays","sourcePdf":"tsp-gershman-2037852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097151S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5345801","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5345804,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Long","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Long","id":"37285706900"},{"name":"Jinghua Kuang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinghua","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37666048000"},{"name":"Shanshan Shen","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37668530900"},{"name":"Kan Zheng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276693000"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5345804","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frame relay","Power system relaying","Protocols","Filters","Equalizers","Noise reduction","Wireless communication","Educational programs","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","protocols","radio links","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive spatial channel mapping","MIMO relay systems","amplify-and-forward protocols","source-relay links","relay-destination links","relaying noise power","system reliability","multiinput-multioutput relay systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative systems","MIMO systems","relays"]}],"abstract":"In multi-input-multi-output relay systems with amplify-and-forward protocols, the source-relay and the relay-destination links can be treated as two groups of spatial channels.

A simulated optical radiation model was constructed to evaluate the identification performance of the given multispectral system for the tree species, and the effects of spectral-band selection and data preprocessing were studied in this setting.

Leica ADS80 airborne sensor with four spectral bands (channels) was used as a fixed multispectral sensor system that leads to response values for the at-sensor radiance signal. Results suggest that this four-band system has inadequate classification performance for the three tree species. The simulations demonstrate on average a 5-15 percentage points improvement in classification performance when the Leica system is combined with one additional spectral band. It is also demonstrated for the Leica data that feature mapping through a Mahalanobis kernel leads to a 5-10 percentage points improvement in classification performance when compared with other kernels.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032239","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1364","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05345831.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated Multispectral Imagery for Tree Species Classification Using Support Vector Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Simulated Multispectral Imagery for Tree Species Classification Using Support Vector Machines","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345831/","accessionNumber":"11138157","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345831/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated Multispectral Imagery for Tree Species Classification Using Support Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"tgrs-heikkinen-2032239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137337S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5345831","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5345833,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Baraldi","affiliation":["Baraldi Consultancy in Remote Sensing, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5416603/5345833/5345833-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Baraldi was born in Modena, Italy, in 1963.

The original contribution of this paper to existing knowledge on the development of operational automatic remote sensing image understanding systems (RS-IUSs) is fourfold. First, existing RS-IUS architectures are critically revised. In this review section, the two-stage stratified hierarchical RS-IUS model, originally proposed by Shackelford and Davis, is identified as a subclass of the parent class of multiagent hybrid systems for RS image understanding, which is potentially superior to the two-stage segment-based RS-IUS architecture that is currently considered the state-of-the-art in commercial RS image-processing software toolboxes. Second, this paper highlights the degree of novelty of an operational automatic near-real-time well-posed model-driven application-independent per-pixel Landsat-like spectral-rule-based decision-tree classifier (LSRC) recently presented in RS literature. Third, five original downscaled implementations of the LSRC system are proposed to be input with a multispectral image whose spectral resolution overlaps with, but is inferior to, Landsat's. These five downscaled LSRC implementations are identified as the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-like SRC, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-like SRC, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer-like SRC, the IKONOS-like SRC, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation-like SRC, respectively. LSRC, together with its five downscaled implementations, called the integrated SRC system of systems, is eligible for use as the automatic pixel-based preliminary classification first stage of a two-stage stratified hierarchical RS-IUS instantiation. Fourth, to sustain the feasibility of the new downscaled LSRC implementations, a novel vegetation spectral index is introduced and discussed. In Part II of this paper, experimental results are presented and discussed for the entire SRC family of classifiers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiometry","Remote sensing","Image resolution","Image segmentation","Computer architecture","Software tools","Multispectral imaging","Satellite broadcasting","Monitoring","Vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","geophysical image processing","image classification","inference mechanisms","radiometry","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic spectral-rule-based preliminary classification","radiometry","SPOT-4/IRS","AVHRR/MSG","AATSR","IKONOS/QuickBird/OrbView/GeoEye","DMC/SPOT-1 imagery","multisource multiresolution spaceborne imagery","remote sensing image understanding systems","multiagent hybrid systems","two-stage segment-based RS-IUS","spectral-rule-based decision-tree classifier","LSRC system","Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre","Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer","Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer","Disaster Monitoring Constellation","LSRC implementation","SPOT-5/IRS","DMC/SPOT-2 imagery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision-tree classifier","image classification","inductive and deductive inference","prior knowledge","radiometric calibration","remote sensing (RS)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5416603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032457","startPage":"1299","endPage":"1325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5416603/05345833.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Spectral-Rule-Based Preliminary Classification of Radiometrically Calibrated SPOT-4/-5/IRS, AVHRR/MSG, AATSR, IKONOS/QuickBird/OrbView/GeoEye, and DMC/SPOT-1/-2 Imagery\u2014Part I: System Design and Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Spectral-Rule-Based Preliminary Classification of Radiometrically Calibrated SPOT-4/-5/IRS, AVHRR/MSG, AATSR, IKONOS/QuickBird/OrbView/GeoEye, and DMC/SPOT-1/-2 Imagery\u2014Part I: System Design and Implementation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11138158","publicationDate":"March 2010","volume":"48","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2010","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345833/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Spectral-Rule-Based Preliminary Classification of Radiometrically Calibrated SPOT-4/-5/IRS, AVHRR/MSG, AATSR, IKONOS/QuickBird/OrbView/GeoEye, and DMC/SPOT-1/-2 Imagery\u2014Part I: System Design and Implementation","sourcePdf":"tgrs-baraldi-2032457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153564S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5416603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5416603","articleId":"5345833","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5345836,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5437364/5345836/5345836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Luo was born in Hunan, China, in 1984.

Mixture Analysis of Hyperspectral Scenes Using Intelligently Selected Training Samples","abstract":"In this letter, we address the use of artificial neural networks for spectral mixture analysis of hyperspectral scenes. We specifically focus on the issue of how to effectively train neural network architectures in the context of spectral mixture analysis applications. To address this issue, a multilayer perceptron neural architecture is combined with techniques for intelligent selection and labeling of training samples directly obtained from the input data, thus maximizing the information that can be obtained from those samples while reducing the need for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n information about the scene. The proposed approach is compared to unconstrained and fully constrained linear mixture models using hyperspectral data sets acquired (in the laboratory) from artificial forest scenes, using the compact airborne spectrographic imaging system. The Spreading of Photons for Radiation INTerception (SPRINT) canopy model, which assumes detailed knowledge about object geometry, was employed to evaluate the results obtained by the different methods. Our results show that the proposed approach, when trained with both pure and mixed training samples (generated automatically without \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">prior</i>\n information) can provide similar results to those provided by SPRINT, using very few labeled training samples. An application to real airborne data using a set of hyperspectral images collected at different altitudes by the digital airborne imaging spectrometer 7915 and the reflective optics system imaging spectrometer, operating simultaneously at multiple spatial resolutions, is also presented and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11246563","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345844/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Mixture Analysis of Hyperspectral Scenes Using Intelligently Selected Training Samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Mixture Analysis of Hyperspectral Scenes Using Intelligently Selected Training Samples","sourcePdf":"lgrs-plaza-2036139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078992S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5446594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5446594","articleId":"5345844","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345856,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5405121/5345856/5345856-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Yu (SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 1998.","From 1982 to 1992, he was an RF Design and Research Engineer with the China Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation, Xingxiang, China.

We focus on packet scheduling, given that it has a significant impact on the overall performance of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. Most previous schedulers designed at the packet level do not take into account the traffic characteristics (different packet lengths and the arrival process parameters); consequently, they fall short of simultaneously providing fairness and a low average packet transmission delay. We are making use of a flexible packet transmission algorithm at the medium access control (MAC) layer to develop and propose a novel scheduler, which is referred to as MIMO packet-based proportional fairness (MP-PF). The new scheduler is designed with the goal of providing high performance in terms of a low average packet transmission delay and time and service fairness among the users based on the concept of proportional fairness. The scheduler also conserves work and takes into consideration the packet length, the user queue length, the user transmission rate (related to its channel quality), and the service guarantees for heterogeneous users. The well-known ideal service fair scheduler called max-min can also significantly be improved using our framework by taking into consideration the traffic characteristics. We also provide an analysis for the fairness of the new scheduler in terms of time and service allocation, which is the key contribution of this paper. Simulations that consider the traffic characteristics and the mobility of users show the relatively low average packet transmission delay and demonstrate the time and service fairness capabilities of MP-PF, compared with other well-known MIMO schedulers.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05345865.pdf","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet Scheduling and Fairness for Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345865/","displayDocTitle":"Packet Scheduling and Fairness for Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177551","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345865/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet Scheduling and Fairness for Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-torabzadeh-2037969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088973S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5345865","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345866,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Sun","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Mobile Communications Group, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5345866/5345866-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Sun (S'02\u2013M'05) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2005.","From August 2004 to May 2008, he was a Researcher with ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan.

In vehicular applications, cognitive radios typically transit regions with differing densities of primary users. Therefore, speed of detection is key, and so, detection based on a small number of samples is particularly advantageous for vehicular applications. Assuming no prior knowledge of the primary user's signaling scheme, the channels between the primary user and the cognitive user, and the variance of the noise seen at the cognitive user, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed to detect the presence/absence of the primary user. Asymptotic performance analysis for the proposed GLRT is also presented. A performance comparison between the proposed GLRT and other existing methods, such as the energy detector (ED) and several eigenvalue-based methods under the condition of unknown or inaccurately known noise variance, is provided.

To reduce the feedback requirement, we propose a two-phase scheduling scheme that exploits quantized channel direction information (CDI) from only a small subset of the overall users, as well as a 1-bit signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) indicator feedback per user. In the proposed scheme, we introduce a newly defined expression for evaluating SINR that extends the existing SINR approximation for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">KS</i>\n = \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n to a more general case with arbitrary \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">KS</i>\n \u00bf \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n. Asymptotic analysis reveals that the proposed two-phase scheduling is asymptotically optimal for large user numbers. Through numerical simulations, we also show that the proposed scheme requires less feedback than conventional schemes, whereas the resulting sum rate loss due to the reduced feedback is negligible.

The antenna design merges two planar inverted F-shaped antennas (PIFAs) into a single-antenna structure that not only occupies less volume in a handheld device but also eliminates the need to separate two individual antenna elements, which provides further space-saving efficiency. This can be accomplished even while maintaining desirable isolation and diversity characteristics. The proposed design can thus be utilized in compact wireless handheld communication devices that require signal diversity. An example design is described for 2.6-GHz LTE/Wi-Fi bands (2.5-2.7 GHz), which has been implemented in real-world cellular phone environments and include interactions between the antenna, other components of the device, and a model of a human head (the specific anthropomorphic mannequin phantom). The simulated and experimental results, including S-parameters, radiation patterns, signal correlations, and mean effective gain values, have validated the proposed antenna design as useful for compact mobile devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05345870.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Dual-Port Diversity Antenna for Long-Term Evolution Handheld Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity methods","Handheld computers","Signal design","Wireless communication","Cellular phones","Antenna accessories","Humans","Anthropomorphism","Imaging phantoms","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","diversity reception","mobile handsets","planar antenna arrays","planar inverted-F antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long term evolution","compact dual-port diversity antenna","wireless fidelity applications","Wi-Fi applications","planar inverted F-shaped antennas","PIFA","compact wireless handheld communication devices","signal diversity","cellular phone","radiation pattern","S-parameters","signal correlation","mean effective gain values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Envelope correlation coefficient (ECC)","mean effective gain (MEG)","multifed antenna","radiation efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Dual-Port Diversity Antenna for Long-Term Evolution Handheld Devices","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5345870/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177548","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Dual-Port Diversity Antenna for Long-Term Evolution Handheld Devices","sourcePdf":"tvt-rao-2037884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104783S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5345870","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345871,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These practical considerations are accurately taken into account. By utilizing the characteristic function (CF) method of error-rate analysis, we interestingly blend the concepts of time and frequency domains and develop an error-rate expression that is simple and general for several system parameters, including adjacent channel separation, RRC filter roll-off factor, and PA output back-off (OBO). Hence, the error rate in the presence of cochannel interference (CCI) is obtained as a special case. The developed results for a single-branch receiver are then extended for diversity receivers, and several interesting observations are made.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2037821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05345871.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2037821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Rate Analysis of Band-Limited BPSK With Nakagami/Nakagami ACI Considering Nonlinear Amplifier and Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345871/","displayDocTitle":"Error Rate Analysis of Band-Limited BPSK With Nakagami/Nakagami ACI Considering Nonlinear Amplifier and Diversity","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177554","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345871/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Rate Analysis of Band-Limited BPSK With Nakagami/Nakagami ACI Considering Nonlinear Amplifier and Diversity","sourcePdf":"tvt-rahman-2037821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074756S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5345871","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345872,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liang","affiliation":["Edmonton Product Center, Schlumberger, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5416618/5345872/5345872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Liang (M'06) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Shenyang Polytechnic University, Shenyang, China, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, in 2004.","From 1995 to 1999, she was a Lecturer and a Research Assistant in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Northeastern University, China.

The starting point of this framework relates to the assessment of the so-called operator functional state using psychophysiological measures. An adaptive fuzzy model linking heart-rate variability and task load index with the subjects' optimal performance has been elicited and validated offline via a series of experiments involving process control tasks simulated on an automation-enhanced Cabin Air Management System. The elicited model has been used as the basis for an online control system via the predictions of the system performance indicators corresponding to the operator stressful state. These indicators have been used by a fuzzy decision maker to modify the level of automation under which the system may operate. A real-time architecture has been developed as a platform for this approach. It has been validated in a series of human volunteer studies with promising improvement in performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2035301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5415834/05345873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2035301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415834","startPage":"251","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Automation System Based on Identification of Operator Functional State in Simulated Process Control Operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Adaptive Automation System Based on Identification of Operator Functional State in Simulated Process Control Operations","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11138017","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5345873/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Adaptive Automation System Based on Identification of Operator Functional State in Simulated Process Control Operations","sourcePdf":"tsmca-mahfouf-2035301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147936S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5415834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5415834","articleId":"5345873","onlineDate":"04 December 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5345890,"authors":[{"name":"Chui-Yu Chiu","affiliation":["Industrial Engineering and Management Department, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Chui-Yu","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37276699000"},{"name":"Cheng-Hsin Ke","affiliation":["Industrial Engineering and Management Department, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hsin","lastName":"Ke","id":"37665874400"},{"name":"K.

Multi RFID readers are implemented to the product line in many industries and they consist of varied reader resources. But there are some defects with the disposition of the RFID-based application. The phenomenon of incorrect negative reads occurs in a multi-tag and multi-reader environment where a tag that is present is not detected. Collisions occurring between readers cause the faulty or missing reads. The stopgap is to solve the frequency allocation problem for networks of RFID readers. Furthermore, finding the optimal structure of readers and scheduling the readers to reduce the total system transaction time or response time are both challenging problems. In the presence of interdependencies, the optimal scheduling problem to minimize the overall transaction or response time is modeled as a graph partitioning problem (GPP). GPP is a well known NP-complete problem. The more readers exist in the product line, the higher complexity of the problem. Designing a schedule having the maximum parallelism reduces the total transaction time but may not minimize it. In this research, we integrate genetic algorithms with binary particle swarm optimization (GA-BPSO) to solve the Multi RFID networks scheduling problem. Simulation results on a real-world problem show that the GA-BPSO algorithm provides robust solution quality and is suitable for scheduling large scale RFID reader networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5345890","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1208","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5345890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05345890.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal RFID networks scheduling using genetic algorithm and swarm intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345890/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal RFID networks scheduling using genetic algorithm and swarm intelligence","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5345890/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004673","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal RFID networks scheduling using genetic algorithm and swarm intelligence","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"02101201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101894S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5345890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5345960,"authors":[{"name":"Valquiria Aparecida Rosa Duarte","affiliation":["Federal University of Uberlandia - UFU, Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Valquiria Aparecida Rosa","lastName":"Duarte","id":"37665424300"},{"name":"Rita Maria Silva Julian","affiliation":["Professor at the Computer Science Department Federal University of Uberlandia - UFU, Uberlandia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rita Maria Silva","lastName":"Julian","id":"37087150174"},{"name":"Ayres Roberto Araujo Barcelos","affiliation":["Federal University of Uberlandia - UFU, Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ayres Roberto Araujo","lastName":"Barcelos","id":"37679736100"},{"name":"Alana Bueno Otsuka","affiliation":["Federal University of Uberlandia - UFU, Uberlandia, Uberlandia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alana Bueno","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37665902600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5345960","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Humans","Computer science","Machine learning","Interference","Cybernetics","USA Councils","US Department of Transportation","Self organizing feature maps","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MP-Draughts","multiagent reinforcement learning system","Kohonen-SOM neural network","multiagent environment","human supervision","continuous activity","VisionDraughts","endgame agent","endgame board-state","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reinforcement Learning","Draughts","Machine Learning","Neural Networks","Temporal Difference","Cluste-ringKohonen Self-Organizing Maps","Games"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345960","abstract":"This paper presents MP-Draughts (MultiPhase-Draughts): a multiagent environment for Draughts, where one agent \u2014 named IIGA- is built and trained such as to be specialized for the initial and the intermediate phases of the games and the remaining ones for the final phases of them. Each agent of MP-Draughts is a neural network which learns almost without human supervision (distinctly from the world champion agent Chinook). MP-Draughts issues from a continuous activity of research whose previous product was the efficient agent VisionDraughts. Despite its good general performance, VisionDraughts frequently does not succeed in final phases of a game, even being in advantageous situation compared to its opponent (for instance, getting into endgame loops). In order to try to reduce this misbehavior of the agent during endgames, MP-Draughts counts on 25 agents specialized for endgame phases, each one trained such as to be able to deal with a determined cluster of endgame board-states. These 25 clusters are mined by a Kohonen Network from a Data Base containing a large quantity of endgame board-states. After trained, MP-Draughts operates in the following way: first, VisionDraughts is used as IIGA; next, the endgame agent that represents the cluster which better fits the current endgame board-state will replace it up to the end of the game. This paper shows that such a strategy significantly improves the general performance of the player agents.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5345960","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05345960.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2275","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5345960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MP-Draughts: A multiagent reinforcement learning system based on MLP and Kohonen-SOM neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5345960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MP-Draughts: A multiagent reinforcement learning system based on MLP and Kohonen-SOM neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11004742","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5345960/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MP-Draughts: A multiagent reinforcement learning system based on MLP and Kohonen-SOM neural networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"03932270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065541S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5345960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5345983,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Li","id":"37674005600"},{"name":"Jinhua Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jinhua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276383900"},{"name":"Miqing Li","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Miqing","lastName":"Li","id":"37675086900"},{"name":"Cong Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37672918100"},{"name":"Hui Lv","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Lv","id":"37670675000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5345983","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel algorithm for non-dominated hypervolume-based multiobjective optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5345983","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Design optimization","Steady-state","Cybernetics","USA Councils","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing","Convergence","Pareto optimization","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nondominated hypervolume based multiobjective optimization","quality measure","evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm","hypervolume based evolutionary algorithm","unique fitness assignment strategy","slicing based method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Fitness assignment","Slicing objectives","Hypervolume indicator"]}],"abstract":"Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure to assess the set of non-dominated solutions obtained by an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm.

This is important since a trend in wireless communication transceivers is the adoption of increasingly sophisticated radio link algorithms which maximize utility functions consisting of network capacity, data rate reliability, and throughput. Many prior efforts in software defined radio suffer from either a presumption that sufficiently high clock rates exist to employ traditional single instruction multiple data (SIMD) multi-processor architectures or that renaissance programmers are available to convert thousand page wireless protocol specifications into fine-grain data flow graphs at the operation level. The challenge for new generations of software defined radio is to maintain flexibility whiles simultaneously supporting computationally efficient broadband communication algorithms and ease of programming. Our system architecture is viable for wide varieties of communication protocols and physical data channels. We focus principally on OFDM transceiver styles due to their bandwidth scalability and their popularity in many next generation wireless air interfaces. Our SDR system jointly minimizes power, maximize algorithm flexibility, and to enable rapid software re-programming.

First, the effective features are extracted from accelerometer data using DCT. Next, feature dimension is reduced by PCA in DCT domain. After implementing the PCA, the most invariant and discriminating information for recognition is maintained. As a consequence, Multi-class Support Vector Machines is adopted to distinguish different human activities.

In this work, a new margin based feature selection model is proposed based on the IPICSR model for supervised classification problems. Owing to the nature of supervised classification problems, a more accurate class separating margin could be found by the classifier.

In this paper, we develop an automated Chinese female facial beauty classification system through the application of machine learning algorithm of SVM (Support Vector Machine). We present a simple but effective feature extraction for facial beauty classification. 17 geometric features are designed to abstractly represent each facial image. The experiment is based on 510 facial images, high accuracy of 95.3% is obtained for 2-level classification (beautiful or not), but the accuracy of 4-level classification is 77.9% by SVM. The results clearly show that the notion of beauty perceived by human can also be learned by machine through the employment of supervised learning techniques. Furthermore, the finding of big gap between the accuracy of 2-level classification and 4-level classification is interesting and surprising: the high accuracy naturally leads to the conclusion that there indeed exists simplicity and objectiveness underlying the judgment of aesthetical ideal facial attractiveness; In contrast, the relatively low accuracy for 4-level classification indicates that the presented simple feature vectors is not sufficient for the classification of other levels of facial attractiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346057","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","startPage":"4842","endPage":"4846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of Chinese female facial beauty using Support Vector Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of Chinese female facial beauty using Support Vector Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346057/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003986","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5346057/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of Chinese female facial beauty using Support Vector Machine","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"08294842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05744S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346060,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["Transportation Management College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37676405500"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Transportation Management College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407076700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346060","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Scheduling algorithm","Job shop scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Single machine scheduling","Genetic algorithms","Transportation","Conference management","Educational institutions","Job production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic scheduling","genetic algorithms","job shop scheduling","minimisation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic job shop scheduling problem","neural network","genetic algorithm","machine breakdown","static scheduling problem","job completion time minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic job shop","neural network","genetic algorithm","hybrid methodology","makespan"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346060","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346060.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"4836","endPage":"4841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network and genetic algorithm-based hybrid approach to dynamic job shop scheduling problem","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of the dynamic job shop scheduling problem when machine breakdown and new job arrivals occur.

Compared with single model fully connected neural networks, NNTrees are more suitable for structural learning, and faster for decision making. To increase the realizability of the NNTrees, we have tried to induce more compact NNTrees through dimensionality reduction. So far, we have used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and confirmed that in most cases the LDA based approach can result in very compact NNTrees without degrading the performance. One drawback in using the LDA based approach is that the cost for finding the transformation matrix can be very high for large databases. To solve this problem, in this paper we investigate the efficiency and efficacy of two centroid based approaches for NNTree induction. One is to map each datum directly to the class centroids; and the other is to find the least square error approximation of each datum using the centroids. Experimental results show that both approaches, although simple, are comparable to the LDA based approach in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346091","startPage":"948","endPage":"953","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346091.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Induction of compact neural network trees through centroid based dimensionality reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Linear discriminant analysis","Decision trees","Decision making","Principal component analysis","Costs","Least squares approximation","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","neural nets","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network tree induction","centroid based dimensionality reduction","NNTree","machine learning","structural learning","decision making","principal component analysis","PCA","linear discriminant analysis","transformation matrix","large database","least square error approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","pattern recognition","decision tree","neural network","multivariate decision tree"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Induction of compact neural network trees through centroid based dimensionality reduction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction of compact neural network trees through centroid based dimensionality reduction","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0166948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0831S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5346098,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zong","id":"37665863900"},{"name":"Feng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37064878100"},{"name":"Jun Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37683631400"},{"name":"Jian Lv","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Lv","id":"37671124000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346098","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling","Clustering methods","Quality management","Decision support systems","Cybernetics","USA Councils","Laboratories","Computer science","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","decision support systems","distributed processing","information retrieval","neural nets","pattern clustering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broker-assisting trust and reputation system","artificial neural network","e-services","e-commerce","decision support systems","trust computation models","distributed trust and reputation system","ANN","broker-assisting information collection strategy","clustering method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346098","abstract":"Due to the dynamic and anonymous nature of open environments, it is critically important for agents to identify trustful cooperators which work consistently as they claim. In the e-services and e-commerce communities, trust and reputation systems are applied broadly as one kind of decision support systems, and aim to cope with the consistency problems caused by uncertain trust relationships. However, challenges still exist: on the one hand, we require more flexible trust computation models to satisfy various personal requirements since agents in these communities are heterogeneous; on the other hand, trust and reputation systems calculate the trustworthiness of agents based on the agents' past behavior. The open environments are dynamic, agents are anonymous and the records about agents' past behavior are distributed in the environments, so agents have to search the required records through the environments due to their lack of valid information. Thus, efficient, scalable and effective information collection strategies are required to address these issues. In this paper we present a distributed trust and reputation system to cope with the challenges. We propose a novel and flexible trust computation model based on artificial neural networks. With the advantages of ANN, our trust model tunes the parameters automatically to adapt to various personal requirements. We propose a broker-assisting information collection strategy based on clustering method. With the support of brokers, subcommunities are managed by reputation mechanism in an efficient and scalable way and help their members collect information with high quality. We show the performance of our trust and reputation system by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346098","startPage":"4710","endPage":"4715","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346098.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broker-assisting trust and reputation system based on artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346098/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A broker-assisting trust and reputation system based on artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346098/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004027","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broker-assisting trust and reputation system based on artificial neural network","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"08064710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084132S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5346107,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavendra V.

A common solution to the localization problem is to deploy a few special beacon nodes having location awareness, which help the ordinary nodes to localize. In this approach, non-beacon nodes estimate their locations using noisy distance measurements from three or more non-collinear beacons they can receive signals from. In this paper, the ranging-based localization task is formulated as a multidimensional optimization problem, and addressed using bio-inspired algorithms, exploiting their quick convergence to quality solutions. An investigation on distributed iterative localization is presented in this paper. Here, the nodes that get localized in an iteration act as references for remaining nodes to localize. The problem has been addressed using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA). A comparison of the performances of PSO and BFA in terms of the number of nodes localized, localization accuracy and computation time is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired node localization in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346107","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346107.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired node localization in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346107/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004036","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired node localization in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0040205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071318S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5346108,"authors":[{"name":"Hsu-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, HungKuang University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsu-Chih","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401094100"},{"name":"Ching-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37291087300"},{"name":"Shui-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shui-Chun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37402313700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346108","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Path planning","Mobile robots","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Convergence","Intellectual property","Software libraries","Real time systems","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","hardware-software codesign","mobile robots","operating systems (computers)","parallel algorithms","path planning","pipeline processing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous omnidirectional mobile robot","SoPC-based parallel elite genetic algorithm","system-on-a-programmable-chip","global path planning","grid-based map","migration operator","population diversity","premature convergence","collision-free path","pipelined hardware implementation","intellectual property core library","field-programmable gate array","FPGA chip","soft-core processor","real-time operating system","RTOS","hardware/software co-design technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elite genetic algorithm","embedded","omnidirectional","parallel","system-on-a-programmable-chip"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an efficient parallel elite genetic algorithm (PEGA) for global path planning of an omnidirectional mobile robot moving in a static environment expressed by a grid-based map.

The PEGA takes advantages of maintaining better population diversity, inhibiting premature convergence and keeping parallelism than conventional GAs do. The generated collision-free path is optimal in the sense of the shortest distance. The pipelined hardware implementation of IP (intellectual property) core library on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip is employed to significantly speedup the processing time. Furthermore, a soft-core processor and a real-time operating system (RTOS) are embedded into the same chip to perform the global path planning using hardware/software co-design technique and SoPC (system-on-a-programmable-chip) concept. The merit and performance of the proposed SoPC-based PEGA are illustrated by conducting several simulations and experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SoPC-based parallel elite genetic algorithm for global path planning of an autonomous omnidirectional mobile robot","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346108","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346108.pdf","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"SoPC-based parallel elite genetic algorithm for global path planning of an autonomous omnidirectional mobile robot","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346108/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SoPC-based parallel elite genetic algorithm for global path planning of an autonomous omnidirectional mobile robot","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"03401959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105141S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5346114,"authors":[{"name":"Sameh F.

When using NC (non contiguous)-OFDM to transmit data, CU (cognitive user) promptly evacuates the channel reused for communication once PU's (Primary User's) reappearance is detected, and needs to acquire new channel. One way is to increase modulation rate on remainder uninterfered channels, while the other is to acquire new channels. Acquiring new subcarriers takes a great portion of the link maintenance time. This paper proposes using increased modulation mode to keep the same transmission data rate so that CU can save the time of acquiring new channel. Numerical result shows that the goodput of increased modulation rate method is 14 Mb/s advantageous over that of acquiring new channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346138/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11004076","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346138/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Non spectrum handover link maintenance performance in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non spectrum handover link maintenance performance in cognitive radio","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"04692713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112372S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5346158,"authors":[{"name":"DongBin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"DongBin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292971600"},{"name":"Timothy C.

It can be done by carrying out negotiation among secondary users. However, significant overhead may be incurred by the negotiation since the negotiation needs to be done frequently due to the rapid change of primary users' activity. In this paper, a channel selection scheme without negotiation is considered for multi-user and multi-channel cognitive radio systems. To avoid collision incurred by non-coordination, each secondary user learns how to select channels according to its experience. Multi-agent reinforcement leaning (MARL) is applied in the framework of Q-learning by considering opponent secondary users as a part of the environment. The dynamics of the Q-learning are illustrated using Metrick-Polak plot. A rigorous proof of the convergence of Q-learning is provided via the similarity between the Q-learning and Robinson-Monro algorithm, as well as the analysis of convergence of the corresponding ordinary differential equation (via Lyapunov function). Examples are illustrated and the performance of learning is evaluated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346172","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346172.pdf","startPage":"1893","endPage":"1898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-agent Q-learning of channel selection in multi-user cognitive radio systems: A two by two case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346172/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent Q-learning of channel selection in multi-user cognitive radio systems: A two by two case","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004110","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346172/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent Q-learning of channel selection in multi-user cognitive radio systems: A two by two case","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"03291893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059192S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5346183,"authors":[{"name":"Ana-Maria Cretu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Ana-Maria","lastName":"Cretu","id":"37273944200"},{"name":"Emil M.

GDNNs are artificial neural networks with internal dynamics. All layers have feedback connections with time delays to the same and to all other layers. The parameters are trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm. Therefore the Jacobian matrix is required. The Jacobian is calculated by real time recurrent learning (RTRL). As both LM and OBS need Hessian information, computing time can be saved, if OBS uses the scaled inverse Hessian already calculated for the LM algorithm. This paper discusses the effect of using the scaled Hessian instead of the real Hessian in the OBS pruning approach. In addition to that an adaptive pruning interval is introduced. Due to pruning the structure of the identification model is changed drastically. So the parameter optimization task between the pruning steps becomes more or less complex. To guarantee that the parameter optimization algorithm has enough time to cope with the structural changes in the GDNN-model, it is suggested to adapt the pruning interval during the identification process. The proposed algorithm is verified simulatively for two standard identification examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346186","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346186.pdf","startPage":"3402","endPage":"3408","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Levenberg-marquardt-based OBS algorithm using adaptive pruning interval for system identification with dynamic neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Levenberg-marquardt-based OBS algorithm using adaptive pruning interval for system identification with dynamic neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11004124","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5346186/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Levenberg-marquardt-based OBS algorithm using adaptive pruning interval for system identification with dynamic neural networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"05843402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083944S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346190,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hsu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hsu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37336440400"},{"name":"Kun-Neng Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Neng","lastName":"Hung","id":"37411801100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346190","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Nonlinear systems","System identification","Convergence","Computational modeling","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Lyapunov method","Real time systems","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-order Hopfield-based neural network","nonlinear system identification","functional link net","nonlinear dynamical system","Lyapunov stability criterion","weighting factors","uncertain dynamical systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hopfield neural network","functional link net","Lyapunov theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346190","abstract":"The high-order Hopfield neural network (HOHNN) with functional link net has been developed in this paper for the purpose of system identification of nonlinear dynamical system.

Instead of using deterministic algorithms or simple genetic algorithms (GAs), this paper presents a hybrid approach of a GA and a stochastic search. This approach comprises two core modules. The first is the interaction module, which is applied to improve the quality of the population through interaction of individuals. The second is the self construction module, which is a stochastic search procedure running without interaction of individuals. The interaction module is implemented as a combination of selection and crossover, which can efficiently exploit the solutions currently found. The self-construction module includes an adjusted mutation operation and three additional operations. This module is the main force to explore the solution space which can eliminate the inefficiency of using classical GA operations to explore the solution space.

In this paper, we compare the performance of four variations of PSO algorithms in several benchmark functions considering five different Random Number Generators. PSO with inertia and constricted were analyzed. Global and local topologies were explored as well. The five different Random Numbers Generators are derived from Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and the Marsaglia\u00b4s algorithm.

However, we also showed that no significative improvements were achieved when we compared high quality random number generators to medium quality Random Number Generators.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346366","startPage":"4988","endPage":"4993","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346366.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the quality of random numbers generators on the performance of particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346366/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of the quality of random numbers generators on the performance of particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346366/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004632","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the quality of random numbers generators on the performance of particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"08554988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052355S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5346407,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37403170600"},{"name":"Yu Suwaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Suwaki","id":"37391698200"},{"name":"Shinya Matsufuji","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Matsufuji","id":"37354063000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4378-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4380-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4379-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3680"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3699"}],"articleNumber":"5346407","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High speed optical techniques","Optical filters","Multiaccess communication","Stimulated emission","Wireless communication","Interchannel interference","Light emitting diodes","Field programmable gate arrays","Optical arrays","Programmable logic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","code division multiple access","interference suppression","matched filters","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel transmission","optical ZCZ-CDMA system","optical wireless communication","optical code division multiple access communication system","code generator","optical ZCZ code","infrared light emitting diode","LED","avalanche photo diode module","logic gates","optical parallel transmission","matched filters","FPGA","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless communication","CDMA system","Shifting of optical axis","parallel transmission"]}],"abstract":"In the high speed parallel transmission of optical wireless communication, shifting of optical axis is important problem. An optical CDMA system using the optical ZCZ code is proposed as a method with the possibility that this problem can be solved without complicating hardware. The optical ZCZ code, which is a set of pairs of binary and bi-phase sequences with zero correlation zone, can provide optical code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system without co-channel interference. We proposed the compact construction of a code generator and a bank of matched filters for this code . In this paper, we verified that this system can remove co-channel interference even if an optical axis is shifted, by experiment of parallel transmission using an optical ZCZ-CDMA wireless communication system, consisting of a infrared light emitting diode(LED), an avalanche photo diode(APD) module and field programmable gate array( FPGA) boards corresponding to 400,000 logic gates. Desired to undesired signal ratio (DU ratio) in correlation output whose shiftings of optical axis are 0\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 are improved about 61.9 dB and 39.1 dB, respectively.

In addition, we propose the effective demodulation scheme to decrease bit errors and compare the BER performances of the proposed method with that of the original demodulation scheme of CDMA systems using complete complementary codes through some numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/IWSDA.2009.5346409","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340201/5346400/05346409.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSDA.2009.5346409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new demodulation procedure for CDMA systems based on complete complementary codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346409/","displayDocTitle":"A new demodulation procedure for CDMA systems based on complete complementary codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003041","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346409/","conferenceDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new demodulation procedure for CDMA systems based on complete complementary codes","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036619S","chronDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340201","isNumber":"5346400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340201","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5346400","articleId":"5346409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5346412,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4378-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4380-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4379-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3680"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3699"}],"articleNumber":"5346412","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Cognitive radio","Peak to average power ratio","Radio interferometry","Interference","Frequency division multiplexing","Chromium","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Chaos","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","codes","cognitive radio","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiowave interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncontinuous carrier-interferometry code","noncontinuous multicarrier system","noncontinuous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average-power-ratio","PAPR","IEEE 802.22","interference avoidance","spectrum hole","NCI-OFDM system","wireless transmission scheme","broadband cognitive radio system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["carrier interferometry","CI","non-continuous CI codes","OFDM","cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"Carrier interferometry (CI) codes have been proposed for multi-carrier systems, e. g., orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM), which achieves higher transmission rate and lower peak to average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, non-continuous carrier interferometry (NCI) codes have been constructed for the non-continuous multi-carrier systems. In the cognitive radio system such as IEEE 802.22, non-continuous OFDM is employed to avoid interference for spectrum holes. In this scheme, all the subcarriers within the spectrum holes are activated. Otherwise, the subcarriers are deactivated. This mechanism is quite suitable to involve NCI codes and formulate the NCI-OFDM system. Simulation results show that the NCI-OFDM system enjoys a wonderful transmission rate and low PAPR compared with the traditional NC-OFDM, which confirms that the NCI-OFDM is a promising transmission scheme for broadband cognitive radio systems.","doi":"10.1109/IWSDA.2009.5346412","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Workshop on Signal Design and its Applications in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340201/5346400/05346412.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWSDA.2009.5346412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-continuous carrier-interferometry codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346412/","displayDocTitle":"Non-continuous carrier-interferometry codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11001990","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346412/","conferenceDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-continuous carrier-interferometry codes","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065729S","chronDate":"19-23 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340201","isNumber":"5346400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340201","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5346400","articleId":"5346412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5346414,"authors":[{"name":"Xueqin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37403103700"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279700800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4378-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4380-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4379-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3680"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3699"}],"articleNumber":"5346414","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346414","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to the construction of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based on hyperplanes (mu-flats) of different dimensions in Euclidean geometries.

This paper proposes two-step SPA decoding method (Proposed Method 1: PM1). The PM1 is as follows. (1) Only parity bits are decoded by SPA. (2) With decoded parity bits, information bits are decoded by SPA. The PM1 can provide much better decoding performance in comparison to the conventional SPA. Furthermore, this paper proposes the combined use of PM1 and method of [4] (Proposed Method 2: PM2). The PM2 provides good performance near BCJR performance.

In this paper the noise reduction of the LCMV beamformer is analyzed and compared with the noise reduction of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. In addition, it is shown that the constraint of the LCMV can be modified such that we only require relative transfer functions rather than ATFs to achieve perfect cancellation of coherent interferences.

These arrays have the advantage of spherical symmetry facilitating three-dimensional analysis. Performance of microphone arrays at the high-frequency range is typically limited by aliasing, which is a result of the spatial sampling process. A potential approach to avoid spatial aliasing is by using continuous sensors, in which spatial sampling is not required. This paper presents an optimal beamforming technique for the spherical-aperture microphone, which is based on a continuous sensor. The proposed beamforming technique is used to compute the optimal real-valued aperture weighting function. Real-valued aperture weighting functions are required to ensure the realizability of the sensor.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346470","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340192/5346456/05346470.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346470","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum directivity beamformer for spherical-aperture microphones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximum directivity beamformer for spherical-aperture microphones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346470/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003008","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum directivity beamformer for spherical-aperture microphones","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"86paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067055S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340192","isNumber":"5346456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340192","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5346456","articleId":"5346470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5346472,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Franck","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IDMT, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Franck","id":"37541150300"},{"name":"Karlheinz Brandenburg","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IDMT, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Karlheinz","lastName":"Brandenburg","id":"37320411700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3678-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3679-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"5346472","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Lagrangian functions","Interpolation","Filters","Signal design","Polynomials","Chebyshev approximation","Design methodology","Frequency response","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","interpolation","optimisation","polynomials","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overall optimization method","arbitrary sample rate conversion filter","integer rate","Lagrange interpolation","polynomial interpolator","discrete signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sample rate conversion","Interpolation","Acoustic signal processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346472","abstract":"Combinations of integer ratio sample rate conversion and polynomial interpolators are widely used structures for arbitrary or asynchronous sample rate conversion (ASRC). However, since these two components are typically designed independently, the performance of the structure is not optimal with respect to a given error norm such as weighted least squares or Chebyshev norms. To overcome this drawback, we propose a design method for this class of ASRC filters that enables an optimization of the whole structure. For this reason, an analytical description of the continuous frequency response of the system, derived from a closed formula for the continuous frequency response of Lagrange interpolators, is introduced. Based on this model, we propose a design method that minimizes the error in the Chebyshev sense. ASRC filters designed according to this design procedure exhibit considerably reduced error norms compared to existing designs, whereas the improvement depends on several factors such as signal bandwidth, the prototype filter order, the integer interpolation ratio and the order of polynomial interpolation.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346472","startPage":"301","endPage":"304","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340192/5346456/05346472.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overall optimization method for arbitrary sample rate converters based on integer rate SRC and lagrange interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An overall optimization method for arbitrary sample rate converters based on integer rate SRC and lagrange interpolation","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346472/","accessionNumber":"11001928","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346472/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overall optimization method for arbitrary sample rate converters based on integer rate SRC and lagrange interpolation","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"88paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075146S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340192","isNumber":"5346456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340192","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5346456","articleId":"5346472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5346482,"authors":[{"name":"Julio C.

To estimate both azimuth and elevation angle with the same accuracy, 3-dimensional (3-D) array must be used. Spherical arrays have the advantage of spherical symmetry, facilitating 3-D DOA estimation. To apply high resolution subspace DOA estimation algorithms, such as MUSIC, in a coherent environment, a smoothing technique is required. This paper presents the development of a smoothing technique in the frequency domain for spherical microphone arrays. We show that frequency smoothing can be efficiently performed using spherical arrays due to the decoupling of frequency and angular components. Experimental comparison of DOA estimation between beamforming and MUSIC with frequency smoothing is performed with data measured in a real auditorium.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346456","startPage":"221","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340192/5346456/05346492.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent signals direction-of-arrival estimation using a spherical microphone array: Frequency smoothing approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5346492/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent signals direction-of-arrival estimation using a spherical microphone array: Frequency smoothing approach","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003018","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent signals direction-of-arrival estimation using a spherical microphone array: Frequency smoothing approach","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"105paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04344S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340192","isNumber":"5346456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340192","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5346456","articleId":"5346492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5346495,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Ganapathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Ganapathy","id":"37637655200"},{"name":"Samuel Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37629677800"},{"name":"Petr Motlicek","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Motlicek","id":"37681641000"},{"name":"Hynek Hermansky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Hynek","lastName":"Hermansky","id":"37284540600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3678-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3679-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"5346495","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Amplitude modulation","Frequency modulation","Speech recognition","Frequency domain analysis","Predictive models","Wideband","Audio coding","Robustness","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","audio coding","frequency modulation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal analysis","autoregressive models","amplitude modulation","frequency domain linear prediction","speech-audio signals","temporal envelopes","frequency modulations","AM-FM decomposition technique","wide-band audio coding","speech recognition","reverberant environments","robust feature extraction","phoneme recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency Domain Linear Prediction (FDLP)","AM-FM decomposition","Wide-band audio coding","Robust features for speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346495","abstract":"Frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) represents an efficient technique for representing the long-term amplitude modulations (AM) of speech/audio signals using autoregressive models.

Most previous approaches rely on the approximation of the mixing process by complex-valued multiplication in each frequency bin. This is equivalent to assuming that the spatial covariance matrix of each source, that is the covariance of its contribution to all mixture channels, has rank 1. In this paper, we propose to represent each source via a full-rank spatial covariance matrix instead, which better approximates reverberation. We also investigate a possible parameterization of this matrix stemming from the theory of statistical room acoustics.

We demonstrate that both filters are related as we decompose the MVDR filter into the LCMV and a matched filter (MVDR solution in the absence of interference). Both components are properly weighted to achieve maximum interference-plus-noise reduction at each frequency bin. Furthermore, we elaborate new closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the LCMV, MVDR, and matched filters. These expressions theoretically prove that a tradeoff between noise reduction and interference rejection has to be made. In fact, the total removal of the interference may severely amplify the output ambient noise. Conversely, totally focussing on noise reduction leads to increased level of residual interference. The proposed study is finally supported by numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11001959","htmlLink":"/document/5346525/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On optimal beamforming for noise reduction and interference rejection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal beamforming for noise reduction and interference rejection","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"21paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065686S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340192","isNumber":"5346456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340192","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5346456","articleId":"5346525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5346527,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Ozerov","affiliation":["Metiss Group, IRISA, Rennes, France","Institut Telecom, CNRS LTCI, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Ozerov","id":"37550840600"},{"name":"C\u00e9dric F\u00e9votte","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"F\u00e9votte","id":"37284366200"},{"name":"Maurice Charbit","affiliation":["Institut Telecom, CNRS LTCI, Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Charbit","id":"37389738300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3678-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3679-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"5346527","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":439},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Source separation","Telecommunications","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Convergence","Speech","Music information retrieval","Conferences","Acoustic signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","signal representation","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factorial scaled hidden Markov model","polyphonic audio representation","source separation","polyphonic audio","Gaussian scaled mixture model","Itakura-Saito nonnegative matrix factorization model","expectation-maximization algorithm","maximum likelihood estimation","speech-music separation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Factorial hidden Markov model","Gaussian scaled mixture models","nonnegative matrix factorization","expectation-maximization algorithm","audio source separation"]}],"abstract":"We present a new probabilistic model for polyphonic audio termed factorial scaled hidden Markov model (FS-HMM), which generalizes several existing models, notably the Gaussian scaled mixture model and the Itakura-Saito nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model.

In particular, a batch-wise adaptation in the frequency domain based on the independent component analysis (ICA) can be effectively used to jointly perform source separation and multi-channel acoustic echo cancellation (MCAEC) without double-talk detection. However, the non-uniqueness problem due to the correlated far-end reference signals still affects the SBSS approach. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the SBSS de-mixing matrix and the behavior of a batch on-line adaptation algorithm under two most common far-end mixing conditions. We show that with a proper constraint on the de-mixing matrix, high echo reduction can be achieved just as the misalignment remains relatively low even for the worst-case scenario of single far-end talker and also without any pre-processing procedure to decorrelate the far-end signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346539/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11003034","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346539/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the non-uniqueness problem and the semi-blind source separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the non-uniqueness problem and the semi-blind source separation","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"41paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048692S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340192","isNumber":"5346456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340192","xplore-issue":"5346456","articleId":"5346539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346561,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085492703"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085589030"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346561","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Quadratic programming","Manipulators","Laboratories","Kinematics","Smoothing methods","Paper technology","Information science","Technology planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","computational complexity","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","quadratic programming","recurrent neural nets","redundant manipulators","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinematically redundant manipulator","recurrent neural network","inverse kinematic motion planning","obstacle avoidance","uncertain system","real-time nonlinear optimization problem","time-varying quadratic programming problem","polyhedral obstacle","velocity smoothing technique","joint velocity assignment problem","structural complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346561","abstract":"Inverse kinematic motion planning of redundant manipulators by using recurrent neural networks in the presence of obstacles and uncertainties is a real-time nonlinear optimization problem. To tackle this problem, two subproblems should be resolved in real time. One is the determination of critical points on a given manipulator closest to obstacles, and the other is the computation of joint velocities of the manipulator which can direct the manipulator following a desired trajectory and away from obstacles if it is getting close to them. Different from our previous approaches where the critical points on the manipulator were assumed to be known, these points are to be computed by using a recurrent neural network in the paper. A time-varying quadratic programming problem is formulated for avoiding polyhedral obstacles. In view that the problem is not strictly convex, an existing recurrent neural network, general projection neural network, is applied for solving it. By introducing a velocity smoothing technique into our previous quadratic programming formulation of the joint velocity assignment problem, a recently developed recurrent neural network, improved dual neural network, is proposed to solve it, which features lower structural complexity compared with existing neural networks. Moreover, The effectiveness of the proposed neural networks is demonstrated by simulations on the Mitsubishi PA10-7C manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346561","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346561.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"142","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning with obstacle avoidance for kinematically redundant manipulators based on two recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning with obstacle avoidance for kinematically redundant manipulators based on two recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11003924","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5346561/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning with obstacle avoidance for kinematically redundant manipulators based on two recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0028137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072042S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5346572,"authors":[{"name":"Heon-Cheol Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heon-Cheol","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599329600"},{"name":"Shin-Kyu Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Shin-Kyu","lastName":"Park","id":"37677784300"},{"name":"Jeong-Sik Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Sik","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405972000"},{"name":"Beom-Hee Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Beom-Hee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281108400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346572","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346572","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Particle filters","Computer simulation","Mobile robots","Cybernetics","USA Councils","Target tracking","Particle tracking","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","particle filtering (numerical methods)","particle swarm optimisation","sampling methods","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO-FastSLAM","particle swarm optimization","simultaneous localization-and-mapping","mobile robot","Rao-Blackwellized particle filter","particle depletion","resampling phase","robot position estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile robot","FastSLAM","particle filter","particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346572","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346572.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2763","endPage":"2768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSO-FastSLAM: An improved FastSLAM framework using particle swarm optimization","abstract":"FastSLAM is a framework which solves the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Conventional FastSLAM is known to degenerate over time in terms of accuracy due to the particle depletion in resampling phase. In this work, a new FastSLAM framework is proposed to prevent the degeneracy by particle cooperation. First, after resampling phase, a target that represents an estimated robot position is computed using the positions of particles. Then, particle swarm optimization is performed to update the robot position by means of particle cooperation. Computer simulations revealed that the proposed framework shows lower RMS error in both robot and feature positions than conventional FastSLAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346572/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11003935","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346572/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PSO-FastSLAM: An improved FastSLAM framework using particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSO-FastSLAM: An improved FastSLAM framework using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"04782763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056168S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5346575,"authors":[{"name":"Erion Hasanbelliu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Erion","lastName":"Hasanbelliu","id":"37424203300"},{"name":"Jose Principe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Principe","id":"37267418400"},{"name":"Clint Slatton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Clint","lastName":"Slatton","id":"38182496000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346575","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346575","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Filtering","Data mining","Shape","Sonar measurements","Object detection","Training data","Testing","Noise shaping","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","higher order statistics","image classification","matched filters","object detection","sonar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correntropy based matched filtering","sidescan sonar imagery","mine classification","nonlinear extension","decision statistic","shape variability","template design","high-order moments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["correntropy","matched filtering","clssification","sidescan sonar imagery"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correntropy based matched filtering for classification in sidescan sonar imagery","startPage":"2757","endPage":"2762","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346575.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346575","abstract":"This paper presents an automated way of classifying mines in sidescan sonar imagery.

NBUTC-PDs with different active areas (28-144 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) are fabricated and flip-chip bonded with coplanar waveguides onto an AlN-based pedestal. The overshoot drift velocity of the electrons in the collector layer of the NBUTC-PD means that both the thicknesses of the collector layer and active areas of our device can be increased to reduce the density of the output photocurrent, compared to that of the traditional UTC-PD. This improves the high power performance without seriously sacrificing the speed performance. According to the measured O-E frequency responses, devices with even a large active area (144 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n ) can still have a flat O-E frequency response, from near dc to 110 GHz. A three-port equivalent circuit model for accurately extracting the 3-dB bandwidth of the devices is established. The extracted 3-dB O-E bandwidth of a device with a small active area (28 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) can be as high as 280 GHz under a load of 25 Omega .

The proposed regrouping PSO (RegPSO) avoids the stagnation problem by automatically triggering swarm regrouping when premature convergence is detected. This mechanism liberates particles from sub-optimal solutions and enables continued progress toward the true global minimum. Particles are regrouped within a range on each dimension proportional to the degree of uncertainty implied by the maximum deviation of any particle from the globally best position. This is a computationally simple yet effective addition to the computationally simple PSO algorithm.

EMO algorithms are designed to find a non-dominated solution set that approximates the entire Pareto front of a multiobjective optimization problem. Whereas EMO algorithms usually work well on two-objective and three-objective problems, their search ability is degraded by the increase in the number of objectives. One difficulty in the handling of many-objective problems is the exponential increase in the number of non-dominated solutions necessary for approximating the entire Pareto front. A simple countermeasure to this difficulty is to use large populations in EMO algorithms. In this paper, we examine the behavior of EMO algorithms with large populations (e.g., with 10,000 individuals) through computational experiments on multiobjective and many-objective knapsack problems with two, four, six, eight and ten objectives. We examine two totally different algorithms: NSGA-II and MOEA/D. NSGA-II is a Pareto dominance-based algorithm while MOEA/D uses scalarizing functions. Their search ability is examined for various specifications of the population size under the fixed computation load. That is, we use the total number of examined solutions as the stopping condition of each algorithm. Thus the use of a very large population leads to the termination at an early generation (e.g., 20th generation). It is demonstrated through computational experiments that the use of too large populations makes NSGA-II very slow and inefficient. On the other hand, MOEA/D works well even when it is executed with a very large population. We also discuss why MOEA/D works well even when the population size is unusually large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346628/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004175","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346628/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary many-objective optimization by NSGA-II and MOEA/D with large populations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary many-objective optimization by NSGA-II and MOEA/D with large populations","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"03051758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075364S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5346629,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Yeh Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Yeh","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37304564000"},{"name":"Sheng-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Wei","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37675974600"},{"name":"Cheng-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346629","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346629","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Chaos","Logistics","Statistical analysis","Random sequences","Cybernetics","USA Councils","Chemical engineering","Stochastic processes","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic catfish particle swarm optimization","embedded chaotic map","gbest fitness value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos","Chaotic map","Swarm Intelligence","Catfish Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346629","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346629.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"3895","endPage":"3900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved catfish particle swarm optimization with embedded chaotic map","abstract":"Chaotic catfish particle swarm optimization (C-CatfishPSO) is a novel optimization algorithm proposed in this paper. C-CatfishPSO introduces chaotic maps into catfish particle swarm optimization (CatfishPSO), which increase the search capability of CatfishPSO via the chaos approach. Simple CatfishPSO relies on the incorporation of catfish particles into particle swarm optimization (PSO). The introduced catfish particles improve the performance of PSO considerably. Unlike other ordinary particles, catfish particles initialize a new search from extreme points of the search space when the gbest fitness value (the best previously encountered value) has not changed for a certain number of consecutive iterations. This results in further opportunities of finding better solutions for the swarm by guiding the entire swarm to promising new regions of the search space, and by accelerating search efficiency. In this study, we adopted chaotic maps to strengthen the solution quality of PSO and CatfishPSO. After the introduction of chaotic maps into the process, the improved PSO and CatfishPSO are called chaotic PSO (C-PSO) and chaotic CatfishPSO (C-CatfishPSO), respectively. PSO, C-PSO, CatfishPSO and C-CatfishPSO were extensively compared on six benchmark functions. Statistical analysis of the experimental results indicates that the performance of C-CatfishPSO is better than the performance of PSO, C-PSO, and CatfishPSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346629/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004176","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346629/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved catfish particle swarm optimization with embedded chaotic map","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved catfish particle swarm optimization with embedded chaotic map","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"06693895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077388S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346639,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Suleiman","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Suleiman","id":"37541167700"},{"name":"Adel Hussein","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Hussein","id":"37535318000"},{"name":"Khaldoun Bataineh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Khaldoun","lastName":"Bataineh","id":"37535021000"},{"name":"David Akopian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Akopian","id":"37266784500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346639","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"abstract":"This paper presents a family of architectures for FFT implementation based on the decomposition of the perfect shuffle permutation, which can be designed with variable number of processing elements.

According to the characteristic of heterogeneous CMP system, we present a novel encoding and decoding scheme of genetic algorithm, improve the crossover operator and the mutation operator. Based on that, we improve the genetic algorithm architecture by using the relative fuzzy membership grade fitness and the elitist strategy.

The algorithms are tested by solving the motion planning problem of a nonholonomic unicycle robot in several maps of varying degrees of difficulty and results show that the generalized methods have excellent performance in such situations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Motion planning","Uncertainty","Robot motion","Orbital robotics","Robot sensing systems","Trajectory","Costs","Cybernetics","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","deterministic algorithms","Markov processes","mobile robots","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic sampling","motion planning","generalized probabilisitic road maps","generalized rapidly exploring random tree","robot motion model","nonholonomic unicycle robot"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346705","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346705.pdf","startPage":"4077","endPage":"4082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized sampling based motion planners with application to nonholonomic systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized sampling based motion planners with application to nonholonomic systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346705/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346705/","accessionNumber":"11004449","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized sampling based motion planners with application to nonholonomic systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"06994077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040306S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5346737,"authors":[{"name":"Khader Mohammad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Khader","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37571332500"},{"name":"Sos Agaian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sos","lastName":"Agaian","id":"37266785500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346737","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2619},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FPGA implementation of convolution","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346737.pdf","startPage":"3478","endPage":"3483","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346737","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Convolution","Hardware","Application specific integrated circuits","Circuit testing","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Energy consumption","Delay","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","convolution","field programmable gate arrays","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","convolution processing time","hardware computing","discrete linear convolution","finite length sequences","convolution building blocks","application specific integrated circuit","image acquisition","convolution circuit","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolution","Verilog","implementations","FPGA","Design and Implementation for discrete linear convolution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346737","abstract":"This paper presents a direct method of reducing convolution processing time using hardware computing and implementations of discrete linear convolution of two finite length sequences (NXN).

The efficiency of the proposed convolution circuit is tested by embedding it in a top level FPGA. Simulation and comparison to different design approaches show that the circuit uses only 5 mw that saves almost 35% of area and is four times faster than what is implemented in. In addition, the presented circuit uses less power consumption and has a delay of 20 ns from input to output using 32 nm process library.

In an attempt to at least partially improve the GPS positioning process, a global ionospheric correction model is introduced within the standard GPS positioning service. Referred to as the Klobuchar model after its inventor, this model appeared as a compromise between computation complexity and correction accuracy. Neural Networks (NNs) are ideal tool for the approximation of single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay behaviour, which has nature highly non-linear. A major advantage of using NNs for the approximation of single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay behaviour over analytical methods is that no previous knowledge of the nature of the non-linear relationships is required. This paper presents the use of NN modeling to approximate single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay to reduce GPS signal propagation error. The ionospheric time-delay is approximated utilizing the Radial Basis Function (RBF) NN approach. The NN-based approach reduces the computational burden respect to Klobuchar model. The method employed here is applicable on the L1 GPS receivers.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346770","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346770.pdf","startPage":"4592","endPage":"4595","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay approximation using radial basis function neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay approximation using radial basis function neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11004562","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5346770/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-frequency GPS receivers ionospheric time-delay approximation using radial basis function neural network","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"07854592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080083S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5346801,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper we propose a framework for enabling the efficient discovery of Web services using artificial neural networks (ANN) best known for their generalization capabilities. The core of this framework is applying a novel neural network model to Web services to determine suitable Web services based on the notion of the quality of Web service (QWS). The main concept of QWS is to assess a Web service's behaviour and ability to deliver the requested functionality. Through the aggregation of QWS for Web services, the neural network is capable of identifying those services that belong to a variety of class objects. The overall performance of the proposed method shows a 95% success rate for discovering Web services of interest. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the neural network algorithm, some of the QWS features were excluded from the training set and results showed a significant impact in the overall performance of the system. Hence, discovering Web services through a wide selection of quality attributes can considerably be influenced with the selection of QWS features used to provide an overall assessment of Web services.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346817","startPage":"4250","endPage":"4255","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346817.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering the best web service: A neural network-based solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Neural networks","Quality of service","Artificial neural networks","Service oriented architecture","Monitoring","Cybernetics","USA Councils","Computer networks","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","neural nets","quality of service","software quality","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web service discovery","neural network-based solution","artificial neural networks","quality of Web service","UDDI","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UDDI","Service Registries","Web Services","Quality of Service","Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discovering the best web service: A neural network-based solution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346817/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering the best web service: A neural network-based solution","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"07284250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101733S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5346819,"authors":[{"name":"Roseann Trevino","affiliation":["Department of Rehabilitation, University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Roseann","lastName":"Trevino","id":"37671133500"},{"name":"Michael Frye","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Inc.arnate Word, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Frye","id":"37393145000"},{"name":"Chunjiang Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chunjiang","lastName":"Qian","id":"37277127700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346819","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346819","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to identify body balance using an artificial neural network approach. This research entails the study of dynamic stability within a normal person. This study is inspired because persons suffering from lower extremity loss suffer a variety of complications including numbness on the residual limb and sores caused from the prosthetic. Because this occurs, they have a slightly abnormal gait pattern, possibly to keep balance while in motion. This study analyzes the gait motion of a normal healthy subject. We take the data and manipulate it to delete or alter the function of the right leg. Data was taken using an 8 camera VICON motion capture system at the Andrew Gitter GAIT Laboratory located in the Audie L. Murphy Veterans hospital. The markers placed at joints of the body were captured to give a 3-D position at a sampling rate of 120 MHz. A neural network was used for the modeling of normal walking gait using the given data.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346819","startPage":"4238","endPage":"4242","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346819.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a full body balance model using an artificial neural network approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Stability","Extremities","Neural prosthesis","Motion analysis","Leg","Cameras","Laboratories","Hospitals","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","image motion analysis","image sampling","mechanoception","medical image processing","neural nets","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full body balance model","artificial neural network approach","dynamic stability","prosthetics","gait pattern","gait motion analysis","VICON motion capture system","Audie L.

This paper explores the link between neural networks and the human brain in the context of simultaneous vs. successive learning. Learning experiments conducted on human subjects were modeled and repeated using neural networks as test subjects. Neural networks confirmed the conclusion from human subject experiments that simultaneous learning was faster than successive learning. Loess and Duncan further extended their hypothesis without formal experimental evidence that simultaneous would outperform successive as complexity increased beyond the scope of their human experiments. Interestingly, neural networks contradict their hypothesis. The results from neural networks demonstrate an existence of a threshold, after which the effects of simultaneous and successive learning become negligible. Intuitively, when humans are presented with complicated tasks, the type of learning is immaterial, since the complexity of the problem would overwhelm any advantages one method has over the other. Confirmation of this intuition can only be confirmed through future human experiments. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that neural networks can be used as a rough model and give valuable insight into a problem, before the costly human subject experiments are conducted.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346827","startPage":"4224","endPage":"4231","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346827.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous verses successive learning in neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Humans","Artificial neural networks","Psychology","Cognition","Learning","Artificial intelligence","Brain modeling","Cognitive science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain models","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive learning","neural network","human brain","learning experiment","human subject experiment","simultaneous learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Learning","artificial intelligence","neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous verses successive learning in neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346827/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004618","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous verses successive learning in neural networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"07244224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051688S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346836,"authors":[{"name":"Salvador Jauregui","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, CINVESTAV, Unidad Jalisco, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Jauregui","id":"37678772500"},{"name":"Mario Siller","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, CINVESTAV, Unidad Jalisco, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Siller","id":"37283465800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346836","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Wireless sensor networks","Surveillance","Monitoring","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Robot sensing systems","Protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radio direction-finding","radiowave propagation","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["localization algorithm","sensor logic location","wireless sensor network","WSN","propagation model","communication protocol","traffic patterns analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WSN","localization schemes","communication protocols","traffic pattern analysis","sensor logic location"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346836","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346836.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"734","endPage":"739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A big picture on localization algorithms considering sensor logic location","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been applied in areas such as military surveillance, environmental monitoring, habitat and structural monitoring, domotics, battlefield surveillance and robotics. The aim of this survey is to present the state-of-the-art in localization algorithms which consider the combination of different factors such as localization schemes, propagation models, communication protocols, traffic patterns analysis and sensor logic location. The latter represents the inherent characteristic of the object to which the sensor is attached to. We believe that the precision of the localization algorithms can be improved when these factors are considered as whole rather than isolated effects. A classification and the main solutions for each factor are presented. The advantages, performance issues and the relation of the solutions with the other factors are discussed.

With encouraging results for synthetic signals, we apply this technique to the problem of image compression, where typical image blocks can be expected to exhibit many very small elements under a transformation like the DCT.

In this research, the classical ACO is adapted in the data-parallel GPU computing platform featuring `single instruction - multiple thread' (SIMT). The global optimal search of the ACO is enhanced by the classical local pattern search (PS) method. The hybrid ACO-PS method is implemented in a GPU + CPU hardware platform and compared to a similar implementation in a central processing unit (CPU) platform.

This study suggests an approach of RBF Network training through simultaneous optimization of architectures and weights with Adaptive PSO-based multi-objective algorithm. Our goal is to determine whether Adaptive Multi-objective PSO can train RBF Networks, and the performance is validated on accuracy and complexity.

Both cases of continuous-time and discrete-time signals are considered, and properties of the mixed transformations are described. The concept of mixed Fourier transform includes the fractional power of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) which is referred to as a discrete version of the fractional Fourier transform. Mixed Fourier transformations can be used for calculation of roots of the Fourier and identity transformations. Examples of such root transforms for signal processing and image encryption are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346884.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"552","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5346884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed fourier transforms and image encryption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Cryptography","Signal processing","Discrete Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis","Discrete transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Equations","Cybernetics","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","discrete Fourier transforms","image representation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed Fourier transforms","image encryption","time-frequency domain","discrete-time signals","continuous-time signal","discrete Fourier transform","fractional Fourier transform","identity transformations","signal processing","signals representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mixed fourier transforms and image encryption","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11004233","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed fourier transforms and image encryption","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"0097547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071252S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5346890,"authors":[{"name":"Subhadeep Chakraborty","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Subhadeep","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37534533700"},{"name":"Eric Keller","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Keller","id":"37429627600"},{"name":"Asok Ray","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Asok","lastName":"Ray","id":"37277094200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2793-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2794-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"5346890","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Samarium","Remote monitoring","Testing","Permanent magnet motors","Degradation","Artificial neural networks","Systems engineering and theory","Aircraft","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","feedback","large-scale systems","machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven anomaly detection","symbolic identification","complex dynamical systems","health monitoring","multicomponent human-engineered systems","dynamical system structure","system identification","grammatical inference techniques","permanent magnet synchronous motor","encoder orientation feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Symbolic Dynamics","System Identification","Fixed Structure Automata","PMSM","Demagnetization"]}],"abstract":"Some of the critical and practical issues regarding the problem of health monitoring of multi-component human-engineered systems have been discussed, and a syntactic method has been proposed.

Particle swarm optimization has been used to solve the optimal problem in the static environment; however, optimal path planning for UGV groups in a dynamical environment has not been fully discussed. Accordingly, a dynamic obstacle-avoidance path planning for an unmanned ground vehicle group was considered as optimal problem for shortest path with formation constraints. The problem was formulated in Cartesian space with detectable velocity of both the vehicles and obstacles. The fitness function was defined by minimizing the trajectory of the group while keeping the V-shape formation of the group. Stable region of the parameters are determined by analyzing the convergence of the PSO algorithm. The simulation results demonstrated that the augmented particle swarm optimization could get the shortest path while keeping the V-formation and converged very fast.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346947","startPage":"4341","endPage":"4346","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5345886","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340904/5345886/05346947.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory planning for an unmanned ground vehicle group using augmented particle swarm optimization in a dynamic environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5346947/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trajectory planning for an unmanned ground vehicle group using augmented particle swarm optimization in a dynamic environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5346947/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11004390","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory planning for an unmanned ground vehicle group using augmented particle swarm optimization in a dynamic environment","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"07434341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060627S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340904","isNumber":"5345886","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340904","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5345886","articleId":"5346947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5347040,"authors":[{"name":"Kaleem Ahmad","affiliation":["Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Kaleem","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37528427800"},{"name":"Uwe Meier","affiliation":["Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Meier","id":"37301196000"},{"name":"Halina Kwasnicka","affiliation":["Phoenix Contact Electronics, Bad Pyrmont, Germany"],"firstName":"Halina","lastName":"Kwasnicka","id":"37595321700"},{"name":"Andreas Pape","affiliation":["Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Pape","id":"37665567600"},{"name":"Bjoern Griese","affiliation":["Weidmueller Interface, Detmold, Germany"],"firstName":"Bjoern","lastName":"Griese","id":"37666240200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2727-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2728-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"}],"articleNumber":"5347040","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Quality of service","Manufacturing automation","Production facilities","Time varying systems","Software radio","Frequency","System testing","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computerised instrumentation","factory automation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","coexistence optimized wireless automation systems","multiple radio systems","quality of service","QoS","industrial environment"]}],"abstract":"The need for multiple radio systems in overlapping regions of a factory floor introduces a coexistence problem.

Furthermore, remote monitoring and control through data-communication networks are very popular for process supervision and control. The usage of networks provide many well-known benefits, but it also presents some limitations in the amount of transmitted data. This fact is especially visible in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where the bandwidth of communication channel is limited and typically all nodes are battery powered. Event-based sampling techniques appear as a some possible solution to face this problem allowing considerably saving network resources and reducing the power consumption. On the other hand, the control system performance is highly affected due to the event-based sampling techniques, being necessary to analyze and study a compromise between control quality and reduction in the control signal commutations. This paper presents all these ideas applied to the greenhouse climate control problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5346987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347045","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340902/5346987/05347045.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The influence of event-based sampling techniques on data transmission and control performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The influence of event-based sampling techniques on data transmission and control performance","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5347045/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003797","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of event-based sampling techniques on data transmission and control performance","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"MF001163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058276S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340902","isNumber":"5346987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340902","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5346987","articleId":"5347045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5347086,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Quagli","affiliation":["Interdepartmental Research Center Enrico Piaggio, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Quagli","id":"37547110800"},{"name":"Daniele Fontanelli","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Information Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Fontanelli","id":"37398642200"},{"name":"Luca Greco","affiliation":["DIIMA, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Greco","id":"37332833100"},{"name":"Luigi Palopoli","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Information Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Palopoli","id":"37268097200"},{"name":"Antonio Bicchi","affiliation":["Interdepartmental Research Center Enrico Piaggio, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Bicchi","id":"37278626700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2727-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2728-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-0740"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-0759"}],"articleNumber":"5347086","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing real-time embedded controllers using the anytime computing paradigm","abstract":"In this paper we present a methodology for designing embedded controllers with a variable accuracy.

We propose two heuristic solutions to find the users to serve in each time slot in an acceptable polynomial time. Finally we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes by mean of simulations and the results shows the near-optimal performance of the proposed schedulers with very low computational complexity compared to the optimal exhaustive search over all the possible users combinations.

Based on that, a proper scheme combining the two typical features in any avionics application, space and time domains respectively. Space-Time Division Multiple Access (S-TDMA) scheme is incorporated were each sub frame is considered for each sub area. With high accuracy timing derived from other applications, all aircrafts in each sub area are operated autonomously from transmitting, broadcasting its own position information or relaying the neighbor's position information. In addition, against the unevenly distributed aircrafts, ADS-TSR (Autonomous Distance Based-Time Slot Reuse) scheme is proposed to enhance spectrum usage and system performance as well. The system shows the capability in enabling a new generation of widening the view for cockpit display not only for nearby area but also beyond the horizon and contribute to the feasibility of the future trend, a concept of free flight in aviation industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/AIAA 28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341931/5347412/05347419.pdf","startPage":"7.D.2-1","endPage":"7.D.2-13","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/AIAA 28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.5347419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.5347419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5347419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oceanic air traffic control based on space-time division multiple access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Air traffic control","Aerospace electronics","Aircraft","Frequency","Accuracy","Timing","Broadcasting","Relays","System performance","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic control","aircraft communication","avionics","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oceanic air traffic control","space-time division multiple access","aircrafts","aeronautical VHF frequency band","avionics","autonomous distance based-time slot reuse","cockpit display"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Oceanic air traffic control based on space-time division multiple access","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5347419/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002733","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oceanic air traffic control based on space-time division multiple access","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"7d2i.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061234S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341931","isNumber":"5347412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341931","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5347412","articleId":"5347419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5347422,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274217800"},{"name":"Han Han","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Han","id":"37401808200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4077-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4078-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7195"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7209"}],"articleNumber":"5347422","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Time division multiple access","Frequency division multiaccess","Interference","Aircraft","Frequency conversion","Chaotic communication","OFDM","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","code division multiple access","frequency division multiplexing","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air-ground aeronautical communications","capacity evaluation","terrestrial communications","TDMA","CDMA","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"In the practical application, the Air-Ground (A/G) aeronautical communications are deployed in three dimensions (3D), which makes the different capacity evaluation from the terrestrial communications, e. g. 3G and 4G.

FPGAs can be particularly valuable in DSP applications because these tend to be data flow type problems. However, many systems employ FPGAs that are older and offer lower performance and fewer resources, making them difficult to upgrade as more powerful and processing-intensive algorithms become available. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the process of translating all or part of a complex application to an FPGA is complicated, time-consuming, and prone to error, and the result often does not represent the optimum design in terms of performance, size, power consumption, and accuracy. As a result, a large, complex application may not fit on a legacy system or meet critical timing requirements. Commercially available automated design tools cannot guarantee that they represent the most optimal solution. In this paper we describe a new approach to automated FPGA hardware design that guarantees optimized hardware in terms of speed, power, area, or any combination of these characteristics while substantially decreasing design time. The approach also guarantees the correctness of the design in terms of the original algorithm, which may speed any required certification or recertification.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.5347446","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/AIAA 28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/AIAA 28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341931/5347412/05347446.pdf","startPage":"6.B.5-1","endPage":"6.B.5-6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.5347446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel technique for upgrading the performance of FPGA-based legacy systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5347446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347446/","displayDocTitle":"A novel technique for upgrading the performance of FPGA-based legacy systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002747","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5347446/","conferenceDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel technique for upgrading the performance of FPGA-based legacy systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"6b5i.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0542S","chronDate":"23-29 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341931","isNumber":"5347412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341931","xplore-issue":"5347412","articleId":"5347446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5347454,"authors":[{"name":"Dayong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Oklahama, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Dayong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37673760500"},{"name":"Hazem H.

The goal is to develop a compact and low cost electronic circuit to drive and control the current of LEDs arranged in a single enclosure. The proposed idea allows using the same equipment in the daily activities, supplied by mains, and under a possible failure of it. The proposal aims energy saving, high luminous efficacy and high useful life when replacing traditional emergency lighting systems, using fluorescent lamps by LEDs. The use of E-27 socket (the same used in traditional incandescent lamps), provides the advantage of easy installation, with the simple replacement of the lamp without any change in the electrical installation. To supply the LEDs by mains and by battery a Buck and a Boost converter were employed. The converters work without electrolytic capacitors which has advantages such as reducing of size and cost of the circuit and increasing the driver's useful life.

To reduce the IGBT dual module losses means to reduce the operational cost of the system.

This technique ensures that the low-frequency voltage oscillation in the dc-link capacitors is kept within established limits while minimizing the distortion of the ac side output voltages. Generally, space vector pulse width modulation schemes (SVPWM) to implement a given output voltage vector it is selected the nearest three vectors (N3V) to reduce the output distortion voltages. However this approach can lead to imbalances and oscillations in the dc-link capacitors voltages. To reduce this voltage oscillations the NS3V diagram can be used, although this technique penalize the THD of the converter output voltages. This work proposes the utilization of limits to the voltage imbalances as criterion to combine the N3V and the NS3V for the back-to-back NPC converter configuration. Thereby, it is established a compromise between the capacitor voltage oscillations and the output voltage distortion. This provide a degree of freedom to operate with a reduced THD in the voltages at the grid side while minimizing the imbalance in the dc-link voltages. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","Diodes","Capacitors","Frequency conversion","Low voltage","Wind energy","Power electronics","Fluctuations","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capacitors","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector PWM modulation scheme","back-to-back three-level diode-clamped converters","space vector pulse width modulation schemes","low-frequency voltage oscillation","dc-link capacitors","nearest three vectors","back-to-back NPC converter configuration","capacitor voltage oscillations","output voltage distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel converters","Space vector modulation (SVPWM)","diode clamped converters","capacitor voltage balance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COBEP.2009.5347717","publicationTitle":"2009 Brazilian Power Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Brazilian Power Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340226/5347583/05347717.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COBEP.2009.5347717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A space vector PWM modulation scheme for back-to-back three-level diode-clamped converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5347717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A space vector PWM modulation scheme for back-to-back three-level diode-clamped converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347717/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5347717/","accessionNumber":"11003193","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 1 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A space vector PWM modulation scheme for back-to-back three-level diode-clamped converters","confLoc":"Bonito-Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil","sourcePdf":"051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050418S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340226","isNumber":"5347583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340226","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5347583","articleId":"5347717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5347726,"authors":[{"name":"Arineu F.

The effectiveness of the Hello protocol depends on the proper setting of its two parameters. Most existing work on the study of the parameter settings was related to a specific environment in connection with a specific network protocol. Independently of any given associated network protocol, this paper studies the impact of network overload, especially the message loss probability, on the choice of these two parameters through both analysis and simulations. The studies show that in lightly-loaded networks with small message transmission loss probability both parameters of the Hello protocol can be set to small values and we can get a fast failure detection time and small number of false alarms. However, in heavily-loaded networks with large message transmission loss probability, the Hello protocol is not effective at all for any parameter values. In normal situations, adaptive changes of the parameters of the Hello protocol are useful.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5347792","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339421/5347769/05347792.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"23","doi":"10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5347792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On parameter settings of network keep-alive protocol for failure detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On parameter settings of network keep-alive protocol for failure detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5347792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11001742","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347792/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On parameter settings of network keep-alive protocol for failure detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"15101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0328S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339421","isNumber":"5347769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339421","xplore-issue":"5347769","articleId":"5347792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5347842,"authors":[{"name":"Li Peng","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Peng","id":"37396719600"},{"name":"Wang Shanshan","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Shanshan","id":"37547509700"},{"name":"Luo Xingguo","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research and Development Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Luo","lastName":"Xingguo","id":"37682862900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4590-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4591-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5347842","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel rate control","Physical layer","Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","Media Access Protocol","Member and Geographic Activities Board committees","Access protocols","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster based reverse traffic channel rate control","CDMA2000","simple reverse traffic channel rate control","reverse activity bit","transition probability technique","rise over thermal","dedicated rate control","reverse traffic channel quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA2000 1x EV-DO","reverse traffic channel","rate control","cluster scheme","transition probability"]}],"abstract":"CDMA2000 1x EV-DO standard has a simple reverse traffic channel rate control scheme including reverse activity bit (RAB) and transition probability techniques. The RAB is used to specify whether the sector's reverse traffic channel is busy or not, and determined by comparison between the total received RoT (Rise over Thermal) and predefined threshold. Obviously, this determination method doesn't consider each access terminal's status or reflect the respective qualities of reverse traffic channels. Therefore, we propose a new scheme based on cluster to realize dedicated rate control. Different clusters represent different reverse traffic channel qualities, and set different probabilities for rate transition. The propose scheme is validated through simulations.

It seems that modern power systems are more exposed to major blackouts. This raises the necessity of having an obvious restoration plan to rebuild the power system as soon as possible. This problem is characterized by a large solution space which can be constrained with expert knowledge. This paper describes a new power system restoration algorithm jointly using genetic algorithms (GA) and expert systems (ES). GA's are used to obtain optimized skeleton networks for power systems, while ES acts as an effective system operator to constrain the solution space for the GA. Also ES allows the GA to be more informed about the overall power system physical performance. This includes, for example, frequency response to sudden load pick up, reactive power balance, load-generation balance, stability limits, high and low voltage levels limits, MW and MVAR reserve requirement and line transfer capability, etc. In order to show the advantages of combining the GA and ES to this problem, this paper presents a comparative result between the hybrid algorithm and pure ES method. The case study presented in this study is 39 IEEE bus systems. The results presented in this paper show that the application of ES can be significantly enhanced by the stated combination.","doi":"10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5347909","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341887/5347868/05347909.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5347909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backbone-network reconfiguration for power system restoration using genetic algorithm and expert system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system restoration","Genetic algorithms","Expert systems","Power system stability","Power system reliability","Artificial intelligence","Skeleton","Power system security","Mathematical programming","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert systems","genetic algorithms","power engineering computing","power system planning","power system restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backbone-network reconfiguration","genetic algorithm","expert system","power system planning","power system restoration algorithm","optimized skeleton networks","reactive power balance","frequency response","load pick up","load-generation balance","39 IEEE bus systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power System Restoration","System Security","Genetic Algorithm and Expert system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Backbone-network reconfiguration for power system restoration using genetic algorithm and expert system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5347909/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 April 2009","accessionNumber":"11001103","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backbone-network reconfiguration for power system restoration using genetic algorithm and expert system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"S09P0619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059345S","chronDate":"6-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341887","isNumber":"5347868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341887","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5347868","articleId":"5347909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5347917,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, NanJing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaohua Zhang was born in Shanxi province, China, on March 1, 1981.

A hybrid method combining the adaptive Lagrangian relaxation (ALR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is presented in this paper. By using Lagrangian multipliers to relax system-wide demand and reserve constraints, the UC problem is decomposed and converted into a two-level optimization problem. The low-level problems solve the optimal commitment of single unit, and GA is used. The probabilities of crossover and mutation are adaptively changed for each generation. In this way, the prematurity can be avoided. The high-level problems optimize the Lagrangian multipliers, and the adaptive updating of the multipliers is adopted. The oscillations of dual gap are reduced by using adaptive updating of the Lagrangian multipliers. Numerical results show that the feature of easy implementation, better convergence, and highly near-optimal solution to the UC problem can be achieved by the method.

This paper introduces a method to design the elements of Q and R by using genetic algorithm (GA). This method is employed for a single machine against infinite bus model of the power system. Since such controller has potential to excite the torsional modes of the shaft system and in order to avoid negative interactions, these modes are taken into account fully in the controller design. Based on the proposed GA-LOC, a controller has been designed and its performance on the power system is evaluated in both frequency and time domains. Moreover, the effectiveness of the controller is compared with the one when Q and R are to be identity matrices.","doi":"10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5347920","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341887/5347868/05347920.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5347920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-mode genetic algorithm based linear optimal control design for power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5347920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-mode genetic algorithm based linear optimal control design for power systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11002570","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5347920/","conferenceDate":"6-7 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-mode genetic algorithm based linear optimal control design for power systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"S09P0377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08532S","chronDate":"6-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341887","isNumber":"5347868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341887","xplore-issue":"5347868","articleId":"5347920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5347956,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The problem of using solar power including varying weather condition brings different output power of the photovoltaic (PV) array, which may cause a serious waste of solar power. For solving this problem, a Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategy is always required to make PV array keep giving maximum power under different environment condition. In this paper, a variable step MPPT based on gradient descent method is proposed for faster and more precise tracking process. A model based on matlab/simulink was established to analysis the performance of the proposed MPPT strategy. Simulation proves that this MPPT method is practical with a better performance than the traditional strategies.","doi":"10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5348202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERGEN.2009.5348202","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Sustainable Power Generation and Supply","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341887/5347868/05348202.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A variable step maximum power point tracking algorithm based on gradient descent method","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 April 2009","accessionNumber":"11001284","htmlLink":"/document/5348202/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable step maximum power point tracking algorithm based on gradient descent method","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"S03P0023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04507S","chronDate":"6-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341887","isNumber":"5347868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341887","xplore-issue":"5347868","articleId":"5348202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348236,"authors":[{"name":"Ni Feng","affiliation":["Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5341887/5347868/5348236/5348236-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ni Feng is born in 1978.

These objectives are usually conflicting. Based on the concept of ideal point, generation dispatch model and generation scheduling model with fuel and emission minimized simultaneously are formulated. It is accomplished by constructing a hyperspace. In the hyperspace, the dimension number of which is that of the goals to be optimized, different coordinates of a space point are of such realistic meanings as costs or emission quantities. Not only the non-commensurable and conflicting problems of different goals could be dealt with, the conclusions also could give us useful insights into the multi-objective real power optimization problems by analyzing the necessary conditions of these models are discussed. These conditions are also helpful when solving these ideal point method models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348339/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11002716","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348339/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"6-7 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization model of power generation with fuel and emission minimized","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization model of power generation with fuel and emission minimized","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"S01P0494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050431S","chronDate":"6-7 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341887","isNumber":"5347868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341887","xplore-issue":"5347868","articleId":"5348339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5348353,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Ruihua","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5341887/5347868/5348353/5348353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["ZHANG Ruihua is an associate professor in the Institute of Electrical Engineering at Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.

(2) filter system suppress harmonic current and provide reactive power compensation at the same time. Through applying IGA to solve these kinds of complex discontinuous optimization problems, designer can quickly find appropriate parameter values to meet the desired power quality requirement, which minimize the total investment cost. A practical optimal algorithm based on IGA for selecting filter capacity values to achieve lowest investment of the filter system is obtained.

In this work, conventional eigenvalue analysis is extended to the probabilistic environment in which the statistical nature of eigenvalues corresponding to different operating conditions is described by their expectations and variances. Probabilistic sensitivity indices (PSIs) are used for robust damping controller site selection and initial parameter setting. A probabilistic eigenvalue-based objective function for coordinated synthesis of PSS and SVC controller parameters are then proposed.

In order to promote wide acceptance by application designers, the most vendors of these technologies propose powerful tools and run-time environments, adequately supporting both offline network configuration and online real-time exchange of process data over the network. The focus of available facilities, however, is merely confined to the network side. The verification of wiring correctness and proper behavior of the plant sensorial/actuation equipment still relies on error-prone and time-consuming manual work. In order to overcome such limitations, a generally-applicable methodology is presented here, aiming to drastically reduce both operator direct intervention and time needed to ascertain that, not only network devices, but also plant devices fulfill the specified application-dependent requirements. Leaving intrinsic features of actuators and sensors out of consideration, typical plant devices are abstractly modeled in terms of the elementary services they may provide and the control/feedback signals they expose to request/notify execution of individual services. Such models give precise indications about devices that do not behave as expected, promptly reporting the cause(s) of each fault and suggesting possible remedies for fault recovery. The validity of the proposed methodology has been experimentally ascertained by carrying out real-life tests on a complex automated machine with a purposely developed diagnosis tool supporting multiple fieldbus technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348409","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340905/5348395/05348409.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model-driven approach to automated diagnosis of industrial distributed I/O systems based on fieldbus technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A model-driven approach to automated diagnosis of industrial distributed I/O systems based on fieldbus technologies","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348409/","accessionNumber":"11001020","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348409/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-driven approach to automated diagnosis of industrial distributed I/O systems based on fieldbus technologies","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s06p07id067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056935S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340905","isNumber":"5348395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340905","xplore-issue":"5348395","articleId":"5348409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5348437,"authors":[{"name":"Behrang Monajemi Nejad","affiliation":["Control Systems Group (Fachgebiet Regelungssysteme), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Behrang Monajemi","lastName":"Nejad","id":"37678982700"},{"name":"Sid Ahmed Attia","affiliation":["Control Systems Group (Fachgebiet Regelungssysteme), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sid Ahmed","lastName":"Attia","id":"37411986100"},{"name":"Jorg Raisch","affiliation":["Control Systems Group (Fachgebiet Regelungssysteme), Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Raisch","id":"37376847800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4220-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4221-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348437","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Algebra","Nominations and elections","Graph theory","State estimation","Communication system control","Control systems","Control theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","graph theory","information theory","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["max plus algebraic setting","fixed communication topology","distributed computing","distributed cooperative control","max consensus algorithm","minimum time rendezvous","leader election application","time-invariant communication topology"]}],"abstract":"Consensus algorithms have been studied in the field of distributed computing for decades. Recently consensus algorithms have attracted renewed attention because they can be exploited for distributed cooperative control. The purpose of this paper is the analysis of a specific class of consensus algorithms called max-consensus. This class of algorithms is needed for applications such as minimum time rendezvous and leader election. A new approach using max-plus algebra is proposed to analyze convergence of max-consensus algorithm. In this paper we focus on the problem of achieving max-consensus in time-invariant communication topologies. Conditions to achieve max-consensus are discussed and the convergence rate of the algorithm for different communication topologies is studied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Max-consensus in a max-plus algebraic setting: The case of fixed communication topologies","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348437","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340905/5348395/05348437.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Max-consensus in a max-plus algebraic setting: The case of fixed communication topologies","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348437/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002535","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-consensus in a max-plus algebraic setting: The case of fixed communication topologies","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s06p03id047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.147342S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340905","isNumber":"5348395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340905","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5348395","articleId":"5348437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5348444,"authors":[{"name":"Evzudin Ugljesa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Evzudin","lastName":"Ugljesa","id":"37294106900"},{"name":"Josef B\u00f6rcs\u00f6k","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"B\u00f6rcs\u00f6k","id":"37295754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4220-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4221-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348444","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"abstract":"Standards and guidelines give advice on the development of qualitative and quantitative criteria to evaluate safety related systems. Success of many modern applications is highly dependent on the correct functioning of complex computer based systems. In some cases, failures in these systems may cause serious consequences in terms of loss of human life. Systems in which failure could endanger human life are termed safety-critical. The SIS (Safety Instrumented System) should be designed to meet the required safety integrity level as defined in the safety requirement specification (safety requirement allocation). Moreover, the SIS design should be performed in a way that minimizes the potential for common mode or common cause failures (CCF). The purpose of this paper is to describe the calculation of MTTF-values for a 2004-architecture with the help of Markov-models. In the paper equations are indicated for PFD for normal and common-cause-failures. The results are high availability and a high reliability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Safety","Application software","Humans","Computer architecture","Standards development","Guidelines","Instruments","Equations","Phase frequency detector"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","Markov processes","probability","redundancy","safety-critical software","software fault tolerance","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sophisticated hardware architecture","safety application","qualitative criteria","quantitative criteria","safety-related system failure evaluation","complex computer-based safety-critical system","SIS design","safety instrumented system","safety integrity level","safety requirement specification","safety requirement allocation","common mode failure","common cause failure","CCF","Markov-model","system reliability","MTTF-value","mean-time-to-failure value","PFD","probability-failure-on-demand","fault-tolerant system","hardware redundancy","software redundancy","time redundancy","information redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["\u03b2-factor","Common Cause Failures (CCF)","IEC/EN 61508","Markov model","Safety Related System","Safety Integrity Level (SIL)","Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)","Probability Failure on Demand (PFD)","2004-Architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348444","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340905/5348395/05348444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of sophisticated hardware architectures for safety applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of sophisticated hardware architectures for safety applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348444/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348444/","accessionNumber":"11001048","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of sophisticated hardware architectures for safety applications","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s01p02id086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053262S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340905","isNumber":"5348395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340905","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5348395","articleId":"5348444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5348448,"authors":[{"name":"Josef B\u00f6rcs\u00f6k","affiliation":["University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"B\u00f6rcs\u00f6k","id":"37295754000"},{"name":"Ali Hayek","affiliation":["University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Hayek","id":"37542113900"},{"name":"Bashier Machmur","affiliation":["University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Bashier","lastName":"Machmur","id":"37679939800"},{"name":"Muhammad Umar","affiliation":["University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Umar","id":"37679944200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4220-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4221-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348448","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Control systems","Safety","Hardware","Central Processing Unit","Logic devices","Computer architecture","Application software","Intellectual property","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","industrial property","logic design","reduced instruction set computing","safety-critical software","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP-core-based safety-related 1oo2 communication architecture","FPGA","embedded system","industrial application","intellectual property","8 bit RISC processor","system on-chip design","VHDL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","Safety-related Systems","1oo2 architecture"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays embedded systems are increasingly used in industrial applications.

In the beginning, their use brought a revolutionary change, but with the constant growth of system complexity, it became harder to guarantee both functional and extra functional properties, as early as possible in the development process. In this paper, we show how formal methods can be applied to describe PLC-based systems and illustrate it on an example of a car wash system. First, we show how the existing behavioral modeling language REMES (resource model for embedded systems) can be extended to model the behavior of such systems. Second, we show how Remes can be translated into networks of timed automata and priced timed automata in order to support safety and resource-wise reasoning about PLC systems. The formal verification of PLC systems is carried out in the Uppaal and Uppaal Cora tools.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348453","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII International Symposium on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5340905/5348395/05348453.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying REMES behavioral modeling to PLC systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348453/","displayDocTitle":"Applying REMES behavioral modeling to PLC systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348453/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11002538","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying REMES behavioral modeling to PLC systems","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s03p03id105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06536S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5340905","isNumber":"5348395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5340905","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5348395","articleId":"5348453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5348469,"authors":[{"name":"Yaser Miaji","affiliation":["Internet Works Research Group, UUM College of Arts and Sciences, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yaser","lastName":"Miaji","id":"37542504900"},{"name":"Suhaidi Hassan","affiliation":["Internet Works Research Group, UUM College of Arts and Sciences, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suhaidi","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37544945100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4590-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4591-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348469","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348469","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet switching","Scheduling","Traffic control","IP networks","Communication system traffic control","Quality of service","Round robin","Bandwidth","Internet","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","packet switching","quality of service","scheduling","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timestamp scheduler chronological evolution","packet switching network","network congestion","network flow control","Internet","network traffic","quality of service","router scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QoS","real time application","scheduling","queueing","network layer"]}],"abstract":"The interest in solving the issue of congestion or flow control in network established from the first discovery and increase popularity of the Internet in 1967 or earlier. As the use of the network deployed and the popularity increase, the issue grows and the demand for an optimal or tentative solution becomes obvious. Since that time there has been an intensive effort from the scholars and researchers to solve the congestion control problem. The problem get worse by the engagement of novel traffic with different characteristics for application called realtime applications such as video and voice applications. Another cause of this demand is the user himself. The attempt in solving the congestion problem in network layer was popular in 90's. This article will demonstrate chronologically how the attempts toward timestamp based scheduling in the packet-switch network have been evolved. Furthermore, the benefit and the drawbacks of using a mechanism will be presented. Also, a brief explanation of the mathematical, conceptual or implementation issue of a mechanism is given. The key success of the scheduler in the market will be highlighted. This paper will stimulate the research thinking to identify the importance and the ability of scheduling in routers to enhance quality of service (QoS) for real time application over other solution in several layers. In addition it will assist the researcher to distinguish the key failure of other proposed mechanisms which have not been implemented in real routers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348469","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339421/5347769/05348469.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"219","doi":"10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey on the chronological evolution of timestamp schedulers in packet switching networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A survey on the chronological evolution of timestamp schedulers in packet switching networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5348469/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11001705","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348469/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on the chronological evolution of timestamp schedulers in packet switching networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"411071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066875S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339421","isNumber":"5347769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339421","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5347769","articleId":"5348469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5348493,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xinliang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xinliang","id":"37678934600"},{"name":"Liu Fang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37670238700"},{"name":"Chen Luying","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Luying","id":"37669408400"},{"name":"Lei Zhenming","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhenming","id":"37370229100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4590-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4591-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348493","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web server","Monitoring","Internet","Gaussian distribution","Log-normal distribution","Security","Robustness","Traffic control","Sampling methods","Spine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","computer network management","Internet","log normal distribution","normal distribution","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet data center","log-normal distribution","security research community","statistical model","anomaly traffic sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Honeypot","Heavy-tail","Anomaly feature","Anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"The deep study of anomaly feature based on the particular server was made in this paper.

The rise time of switching window does not strongly depend on clock pulse energy, whereas the FWHM and fall time of switching window are increasing with the increase of the clock pulse energy.

From the simulated analyses, it is clear that for the higher output channel suppression ratio, the input clock signal with TE mode is required.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348513","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339421/5347769/05348513.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"374","doi":"10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"640Gbit/s all-optical demultiplexing using nonlinear polarization rotat in semiconductor optical amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"640Gbit/s all-optical demultiplexing using nonlinear polarization rotat in semiconductor optical amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5348513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11001664","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"640Gbit/s all-optical demultiplexing using nonlinear polarization rotat in semiconductor optical amplifier","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"73115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055917S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339421","isNumber":"5347769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339421","xplore-issue":"5347769","articleId":"5348513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5348522,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Lei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37656322800"},{"name":"Ma Jun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Jun","id":"37669452500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4590-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4591-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348522","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"abstract":"Most recent methods for image classification focus on how to formulate different types of features effectively in a uniform formula. Although these features take on different importance for image classification, most previous work gives the same weight to the features when they are combined. In this paper, we propose an approach to integrate multi-features by following the multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework. By using distinct kernels, we propose to combine different similarity measures for each feature type, that is, the feature fusion is calculated at kernel-level. We employ the SimpleMKL algorithm to solve the MKL problem. As illustrated in the experiments on the images extracted from Corel, Caltech-101 and Flickr 18, our approach outperforms the usual fusion schemes in terms of prediction accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image classification","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Histograms","Machine learning","Computer science","Accuracy","Pattern recognition","Voting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","multiple kernel learning","SimpleMKL algorithm","feature fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image classification","multiple kernel learning (MKL)","SVM","SimpleMKL","bag of visual words"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348522","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Broadband Network & Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339421/5347769/05348522.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5347769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5348522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating multi-features by multiple kernel learning to better classify images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrating multi-features by multiple kernel learning to better classify images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348522/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348522/","accessionNumber":"11002862","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating multi-features by multiple kernel learning to better classify images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"97396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089353S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339421","isNumber":"5347769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339421","xplore-issue":"5347769","articleId":"5348522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5348570,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Sauer","affiliation":["Corning, Inc.orporated, Corning, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Sauer","id":"37297870100"},{"name":"Andrey Kobyakov","affiliation":["Corning, Inc.orporated, Corning, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Kobyakov","id":"37294480900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-55752-863-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-108X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1098"}],"articleNumber":"5348570","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna feeds","MIMO","Optical signal processing","Transmitting antennas","Wireless LAN","Throughput","Optical receivers","Signal design","Antenna measurements","Optical fiber losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","microwave photonics","MIMO communication","optical fibre losses","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeding","MIMO systems","fiber-radio links","optical loss"]},{"kwd":["(060.2360) Fiber optic links and and subsystems","(060.2310) Fiber optics"]}],"abstract":"We analyze the performance of MIMO systems fed by fiber-radio links and show that the separation of the MIMO antennas increases the overall coverage area and leads to improved throughput.

The advances are in three key areas for massively parallel computation such as on BlueGene/L (BG/L): fault tolerance, application kernel optimization, and highly efficient parallel I/O. In particular, we have developed novel capabilities for handling hardware parity errors and improving the speed of interatomic force calculations, while achieving near optimal I/O speeds on BG/L, allowing us to achieve excellent scalability and improve overall application performance. As a result we have successfully conducted a 2-billion atom KH simulation amounting to 2.8 CPU-millennia of run time, including a single, continuous simulation run in excess of 1.5 CPU-millennia. We have also conducted 9-billion and 62.5-billion atom KH simulations. The current optimized ddcMD code is benchmarked at 115.1 TFlop/s in our scaling study and 103.9 TFlop/s in a sustained science run, with additional improvements ongoing. These improvements enabled us to run the first MD simulations of micron-scale systems developing the KH instability.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending stability beyond CPU millennium: a micron-scale atomistic simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Information science","Licenses","Hardware","Software algorithms","Permission","Computer science","Concurrent computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Extending stability beyond CPU millennium: a micron-scale atomistic simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348795/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending stability beyond CPU millennium: a micron-scale atomistic simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072151S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348800,"authors":[{"name":"Song Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Fu","id":"37274930100"},{"name":"Cheng-Zhong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Zhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278305300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348800","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software measurement","Checkpointing","Large-scale systems","Computer networks","Accuracy","Availability","Permission","Technology management","Stochastic processes","Information systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coalition clusters","failure prediction","spatial correlation","system availability","temporal correlation"]}],"abstract":"In large-scale networked computing systems, component failures become norms instead of exceptions. Failure prediction is a crucial technique for self-managing resource burdens. Failure events in coalition systems exhibit strong correlations in time and space domain.

We further utilize the information of application allocation to discover more correlations among failure instances. We cluster failure events based on their correlations and predict their future occurrences. We implemented a failure prediction framework, called PREdictor of Failure Events Correlated Temporal-Spatially (hPREFECTs), which explores correlations among failures and forecasts the time-between-failure of future instances. We evaluate the performance of hPREFECTs in both offline prediction of failure by using the Los Alamos HPC traces and online prediction in an institute-wide clusters coalition environment.

Falkon's integration of multi-level scheduling and streamlined dispatchers delivers performance not provided by any other system. We describe Falkon architecture and implementation, and present performance results for both microbenchmarks and applications. Microbenchmarks show that Falkon throughput (487 tasks/sec) and scalability (to 54,000 executors and 2,000,000 tasks processed in just 112 minutes) are one to two orders of magnitude better than other systems used in production Grids. Large-scale astronomy and medical applications executed under Falkon by the Swift parallel programming system achieve up to 90% reduction in end-to-end run time, relative to versions that execute tasks via separate scheduler submissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5348802/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Falkon: a Fast and Light-weight tasK executiON framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Falkon: a Fast and Light-weight tasK executiON framework","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079403S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5348805,"authors":[{"name":"Bingsheng He","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Bingsheng","lastName":"He","id":"37532755800"},{"name":"Naga K.

In this paper, we study these two operations on graphics processing units (GPUs). With superior computing power and high memory bandwidth, GPUs have become a commodity multiprocessor platform for general-purpose high-performance computing. However, due to the random access nature of gather and scatter, a naive implementation of the two operations suffers from a low utilization of the memory bandwidth and consequently a long, unhidden memory latency. Additionally, the architectural details of the GPUs, in particular, the memory hierarchy design, are unclear to the programmers. Therefore, we design multi-pass gather and scatter operations to improve their data access locality, and develop a performance model to help understand and optimize these two operations. We have evaluated our algorithms in sorting, hashing, and the sparse matrix-vector multiplication in comparison with their optimized CPU counterparts. Our results show that these optimizations yield 2--4X improvement on the GPU bandwidth utilization and 30--50% improvement on the response time. Overall, our optimized GPU implementations are 2--7X faster than their optimized CPU counterparts.","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362684","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348805.pdf","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348805/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient gather and scatter operations on graphics processors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5348805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient gather and scatter operations on graphics processors","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069204S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5348806,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa M Tikir","affiliation":["Performance Modeling and Characterization Laboratory, San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mustafa M","lastName":"Tikir","id":"37393240000"},{"name":"Laura Carrington","affiliation":["Performance Modeling and Characterization Laboratory, San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Carrington","id":"37393242500"},{"name":"Erich Strohmaier","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Strohmaier","id":"37271736300"},{"name":"Allan Snavely","affiliation":["Performance Modeling and Characterization Laboratory, San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Allan","lastName":"Snavely","id":"37281816700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348806","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348806","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Robustness","Delay","Computer architecture","Computer science","Data engineering","Large-scale systems","Aggregates","Bandwidth","Application software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cache bandwidth","genetic algorithms","machine learning","memory bound applications","performance modeling and prediction"]}],"abstract":"Benchmarks that measure memory bandwidth, such as STREAM, Apex-MAPS and MultiMAPS, are increasingly popular due to the \"Von Neumann\" bottleneck of modern processors which causes many calculations to be memory-bound.

Coordinating multiple languages, especially very different languages like hardware and software languages, is awkward and error prone. Additionally, implementing communication mechanisms between different device types unnecessarily increases development time. This is compounded by the fact that the application developer, to be effective, needs performance data about the application early in the design cycle. We describe an application development environment specifically targeted at hybrid systems, supporting data-flow semantics between application kernels deployed on a variety of device types.

High-performance implementations use multiple levels of tiling to exploit the hierarchy of parallelism and cache/register locality. Efficient generation of multi-level tiled code is essential for effective use of multi-level tiling. Parameterized tiled code, where tile sizes are not fixed but left as symbolic parameters can enable several dynamic and run-time optimizations. Previous solutions to multi-level tiled loop generation are limited to the case where tile sizes are fixed at compile time. We present an algorithm that can generate multi-level parameterized tiled loops at the same cost as generating single-level tiled loops. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated on several benchmarks. We also present a method-useful in register tiling-for separating partial and full tiles at any arbitrary level of tiling.

These architectures support single-threaded performance and multithreaded throughput at lower costs (e.g., die size and power). However, they also pose unique challenges to operating systems, which traditionally assume homogeneous hardware. This paper presents AMPS, an operating system scheduler that efficiently supports both SMP-and NUMA-style performance-asymmetric architectures. AMPS contains three components: asymmetry-aware load balancing, faster-core-first scheduling, and NUMA-aware migration. We have implemented AMPS in Linux kernel 2.6.16 and used CPU clock modulation to emulate performance asymmetry on an SMP and NUMA system. For various workloads, we show that AMPS achieves a median speedup of 1.16 with a maximum of 1.44 over stock Linux on the SMP, and a median of 1.07 with a maximum of 2.61 on the NUMA system. Our results also show that AMPS improves fairness and repeatability of application performance measurements.","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362694","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient operating system scheduling for performance-asymmetric multi-core architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient operating system scheduling for performance-asymmetric multi-core architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348812/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5348812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient operating system scheduling for performance-asymmetric multi-core architectures","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124115S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5348824,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Lingyun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37336092800"},{"name":"Chuang Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292985200"},{"name":"Jennifer M.

In this paper we introduce a strategy to detect anomalies and diagnose the possible reasons behind them. Our approach extends the traditional window-based strategy by using signal-processing techniques to filter out recurring, background fluctuations in resource behavior. In addition, we have developed a diagnosis technique that uses standard monitoring data to determine which related changes in behavior may cause anomalies. We evaluate our anomaly detection and diagnosis technique by applying it in three contexts when we insert anomalies into the system at random intervals. The experimental results show that our strategy detects up to 96% of anomalies while reducing the false positive rate by up to 90% compared to the traditional window average strategy. In addition, our strategy can diagnose the reason for the anomaly approximately 75% of the time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection and diagnosis in grid environments","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362667","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348824.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection and diagnosis in grid environments","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348824/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection and diagnosis in grid environments","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080284S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5348835,"authors":[{"name":"Rubing Duan","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Rubing","lastName":"Duan","id":"37301850800"},{"name":"Radu Prodan","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Prodan","id":"37299754000"},{"name":"Thomas Fahringer","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Fahringer","id":"37299753200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-59593-764-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348835","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Large-scale systems","Application software","Resource management","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","Partitioning algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Heuristic algorithms","Computer science"]}],"abstract":"Scheduling large-scale applications on the Grid is a fundamental challenge and is critical to application performance and cost. Large-scale applications typically contain a large number of homogeneous and concurrent activities which are main bottlenecks, but open great potentials for optimization. This paper presents a new formulation of the well-known NP-complete problems and two novel algorithms that addresses the problems. The optimization problems are formulated as sequential cooperative games among workflow managers. Experimental results indicate that we have successfully devised and implemented one group of effective, efficient, and feasible approaches. They can produce soultuins of significantly better performance and cost than traditional algorithms. Our algorithms have considerably low time complexity and can assign 1,000,000 activities to 10,000 processors within 0.4 second on one Opteron processor. Moreover, the solutions can be practically performed by workflow managers, and the violation of QoS can be easily detected, which are critical to fault tolerance.","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362639","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and cost optimization for multiple large-scale grid workflow applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348835/","displayDocTitle":"Performance and cost optimization for multiple large-scale grid workflow applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5348835/","conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and cost optimization for multiple large-scale grid workflow applications","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077723S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348860,"authors":[{"name":"Rajagopal Ananthanarayanan","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajagopal","lastName":"Ananthanarayanan","id":"37683387100"},{"name":"Dharmendra S.

An important step towards this end is the study of large networks of cortical spiking neurons. We have built a cortical simulator, C2, incorporating several algorithmic enhancements to optimize the simulation scale and time, through: computationally efficient simulation of neurons in a clock-driven and synapses in an event-driven fashion; memory efficient representation of simulation state; and communication efficient message exchanges. Using phenomenological, single-compartment models of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing dependent plasticity, we represented a rat-scale cortical model (55 million neurons, 442 billion synapses) in STB memory of a 32, 768-processor BlueGene/L. With 1 millisecond resolution for neuronal dynamics and 1--20 milliseconds axonal delays, C2 can simulate 1 second of model time in 9 seconds per Hertz of average neuronal firing rate. In summary, by combining state-of-the-art hardware with innovative algorithms and software design, we simultaneously achieved unprecedented time-to-solution on an unprecedented problem size.","doi":"10.1145/1362622.1362627","publicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348789/5348790/05348860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1362622.1362627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348790","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anatomy of a cortical simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anatomy of a cortical simulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348860/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5348860/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anatomy of a cortical simulator","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"37640003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077597S","chronDate":"10-16 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5348789","isNumber":"5348790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348789","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5348790","articleId":"5348860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348869,"authors":[{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"},{"name":"Hans Mulder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Mulder","id":"38180988500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-459-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348869","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":23,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process design"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOVE: a framework for high-performance processor design","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1145/125826.126159","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348845/5348846/05348869.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/125826.126159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"MOVE: a framework for high-performance processor design","conferenceDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOVE: a framework for high-performance processor design","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"5348869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048723S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"5348846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348845","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5348869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348871,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Zagha","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Zagha","id":"37378459800"},{"name":"Guy E.

We introduce a new hardware scheme based on the prediction of the execution of the instruction stream and associated operand references. It consists of a reference prediction table and a look-ahead program counter and its associated logic. With this scheme, data with regular access patterns is preloaded, independently of the stride size, and preloading of data with irregular access patterns is prevented. We evaluate our design through trace driven simulation by comparing it with a pure data cache approach under three different memory access models. Our experiments show that this scheme is very effective for reducing the data access penalty for scientific programs and that is has moderate success for other applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective on-chip preloading scheme to reduce data access penalty","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1145/125826.125932","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348845/5348846/05348911.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/125826.125932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348846","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"An effective on-chip preloading scheme to reduce data access penalty","conferenceDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"11083916","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective on-chip preloading scheme to reduce data access penalty","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"5348911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057989S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"5348846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348845","citationCount":"123","articleId":"5348911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348959,"authors":[{"name":"William Pugh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Pugh","id":"37320870600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-459-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5348959","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis","Production","Polynomials","Vectors","Workstations","NP-complete problem","Software tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348959","abstract":"The Omega test is an integer programming algorithm that can determine whether a dependence exists between two array references, and if so, under what conditions. Conventional wisdom holds that integer programming techniques are far too expensive to be used for dependence analysis, except as a method of last resort for situations that cannot be decided by simpler methods. We present evidence that suggests this wisdom is wrong, and that the Omega test is competitive with approximate algorithms used in practice and suitable for use in production compilers. The Omega test is based on an extension of FourierMotzkin variable elimination to integer programming, and has worst-case exponential time complexity. However, we show that for many situations in which other (polynomial) methods are accurate, the Omega test has low order polynomial time complexity. The Omega test can be used to simplify integer programming problems, rather than just deciding them. This has many applications, including accurately and efficiently computing dependence direction and distance vectors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348846","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '91:Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348845/5348846/05348959.pdf","doi":"10.1145/125826.125848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/125826.125848","startPage":"4","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Omega test: A fast and practical integer programming algorithm for dependence analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348959/","displayDocTitle":"The Omega test: A fast and practical integer programming algorithm for dependence analysis","conferenceDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Omega test: A fast and practical integer programming algorithm for dependence analysis","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"5348959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023614S","chronDate":"18-22 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"5348846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348845","citationCount":"101","articleId":"5348959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5348968,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Tiles become a natural candidate as the unit of work for parallel task scheduling. Synchronization between processors can be done between tiles, reducing synchronization frequency (at some loss of potential parallelism). The shape and size of a tile can be optimized to take advantage of memory locality for memory hierarchy utilization. Vectorization and register locality naturally fits into the optimization within a tile, while parallelization and cache locality fits into optimization between tiles.","doi":"10.1145/76263.76337","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '89:Proceedings of the 1989 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '89:Proceedings of the 1989 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5348943/5348944/05348968.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/76263.76337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5348944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"More iteration space tiling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5348968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Nov. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5348968/","displayDocTitle":"More iteration space tiling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","conferenceDate":"12-17 Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"More iteration space tiling","confLoc":"Reno, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"5348968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033522S","chronDate":"12-17 Nov. 1989","isNumber":"5348944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5348943","citationCount":"94","articleId":"5348968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5348973,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Experiments show that the adaptive TTS-Coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) can get more excellent composite service plan than Matrix-Coded and Tree-Coded GA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349052/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11006312","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349052/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TTS-Coded Genetic Algorithm for QoS-driven web service selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TTS-Coded Genetic Algorithm for QoS-driven web service selection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"807251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053608S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5349061,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optic-Electronic & Communication, Jiangxi Science and Technique Normal University, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Lin","id":"37674338300"},{"name":"Fang Zhijun","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Fang Zhijun","id":"37267681000"},{"name":"Wang Shengqian","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optic-Electronic & Communication, Jiangxi Science and Technique Normal University, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Wang Shengqian","id":"37328977100"},{"name":"Zhang Wenrui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optic-Electronic & Communication, Jiangxi Science and Technique Normal University, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Wenrui","id":"37671025300"},{"name":"Yang Fan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optic-Electronic & Communication, Jiangxi Science and Technique Normal University, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Yang Fan","id":"37678206700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349061","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Infrared imaging","Optical fiber communication","Lighting","Infrared heating","Skin","Temperature","Laboratories","Biomedical optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","infrared imaging","principal component analysis","Radon transforms","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infrared face recognition","Radon transform","multiwavelet transform","PCA","low-frequency components","infrared facial images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiwavelet","Radon","infrared face recognition"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new infrared face recognition approach combining Radon, multiwavelet transform and PCA, which gains the low-frequency components LL via Radon and multiwavelet transform and then applies the PCA to LL to get the features of the infrared facial images.

This study investigated the classification accuracy of a combined surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) sensor system for monitoring activities of daily living in patients with stroke. sEMG and ACC data (eight channels each) were recorded from 10 hemiparetic patients while they carried out a sequence of 11 activities of daily living (identification tasks), and 10 activities used to evaluate misclassification errors (nonidentification tasks). The sEMG and ACC sensor data were analyzed using a multilayered neural network and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to identify the minimal sensor configuration needed to accurately classify the identification tasks, with a minimal number of misclassifications from the nonidentification tasks. The results demonstrated that the highest sensitivity and specificity for the identification tasks was achieved using a subset of four ACC sensors and adjacent sEMG sensors located on both upper arms, one forearm, and one thigh, respectively. This configuration resulted in a mean sensitivity of 95.0%, and a mean specificity of 99.7% for the identification tasks, and a mean misclassification error of <10% for the nonidentification tasks. The findings support the feasibility of a hybrid sEMG and ACC wearable sensor system for automatic recognition of motor tasks used to assess functional independence in patients with stroke.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11037608","pubMedId":"20051332","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5349073/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Combined sEMG and Accelerometer System for Monitoring Functional Activity in Stroke","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined sEMG and Accelerometer System for Monitoring Functional Activity in Stroke","sourcePdf":"tnsre-sroy-2036615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12047S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5349072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5349072","articleId":"5349073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5349085,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Yang","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, China"],"lastName":"Xi Yang","id":"37672383300"},{"name":"Minghua He","affiliation":["College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, China"],"lastName":"Minghua He","id":"37672093700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349085","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Time frequency analysis","Personal area networks","Interference","Code standards","FCC","Bandwidth","Helium","Educational institutions","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","diversity reception","interference (signal)","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband orthogonal frequency division modulation","ultra-wide band system","MB-OFDM UWB system","time-frequency codes","interferences","neighboring piconets","international standard ECMA-368","collision possibility","channel diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-Frequency Codes","Interference","UWB","MB-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a time-frequency code by 5 bands in multi-band orthogonal frequency division modulation (MB-OFDM) ultra-wide band (UWB) system to enhance the performance in a situation where interferences happen among neighboring piconets.

Combined with bidirectional shift registers to store survivor path history, branch identification and branch metrics of each node, all the rules of the Fano algorithm are checked immediately and corresponding procedures like forward move, backward move and loosen threshold are implemented in the one clock cycle. A FPGA prototype of Fano decoder is built, and high speed is obtained by optimized state scheme to avoid additional time consuming read/write operations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349112","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349112.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","startPage":"687","endPage":"691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple hardware implementation of soft decision sequential decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple hardware implementation of soft decision sequential decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349112/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006369","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349112/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple hardware implementation of soft decision sequential decoder","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"638208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071784S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349116,"authors":[{"name":"Yinglei Teng","affiliation":["BUPT-Ericsson Future Communication Research and Development Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinglei","lastName":"Teng","id":"37410693400"},{"name":"Mei Song","affiliation":["BUPT-Ericsson Future Communication Research and Development Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Song","id":"37278154700"},{"name":"Yong Zhang","affiliation":["BUPT-Ericsson Future Communication Research and Development Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405802800"},{"name":"Yijia Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Yijia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37674135000"},{"name":"Junde Song","affiliation":["BUPT-Ericsson Future Communication Research and Development Center, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junde","lastName":"Song","id":"37277429900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349116","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Relays","Resource management","Power system relaying","Decision making","Nash equilibrium","Intelligent networks","Research and development","Computer networks","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","frequency division multiple access","game theory","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA orthogonal channels","hierarchical game theory","subscribers cooperative relaying network","user coalition","global optimal solution","resource allocation","Nash equilibrium game","access point level","scheduling evaluation","two-user decision making game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative transmission","game theory","infrastructure relay","subscriber relay"]}],"abstract":"A two-user decision making game is studied in the OFDM based subscriber cooperative relaying network, in which subscribers transmit their own data in the first phase, while helping to retransmit their partner's or choosing to freeride in the second phase. In the paper, we study a hierarchical game (HG) for a two user coalition, where cooperation is preferred and total payoff is transferable. Instead of consulting to a global optimal solution, we decouple the cooperation resource allocation into two level subproblems: a user level Nash equilibrium game for distributed cooperation decision and an access point (AP) level coalition game for centralized resource allocation. Meanwhile, due to the consideration of efficiency and immediacy, we reduce a repeated game theory into a scheduling evaluation across two scheduling time slots-the second cooperation phase in the first time slot and the first self-transmission phase in the next slot. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a well tradeoff between fairness and efficiency, and greatly reduces the system complexity compared to the centralized resource allocation strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349116","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349116.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical game theory analysis in subscribers cooperative relaying network with OFDMA orthogonal channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349116/","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical game theory analysis in subscribers cooperative relaying network with OFDMA orthogonal channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006373","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349116/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical game theory analysis in subscribers cooperative relaying network with OFDMA orthogonal channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"634519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07018S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349119,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan Zhang","affiliation":["IRT Laboratory, Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405436600"},{"name":"Hidetoshi Kayama","affiliation":["IRT Laboratory, Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hidetoshi","lastName":"Kayama","id":"37296977000"},{"name":"Xiaolin Hou","affiliation":["IRT Laboratory, Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Hou","id":"37281315400"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Otsuka","affiliation":["IRT Laboratory, Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37396597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Signal design","OFDM","Time-varying channels","Clustering algorithms","Receivers","Multipath channels","Image processing","Image denoising","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","least squares approximations","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel tracking","multi-carrier transmissions","high-mobility radio channels","OFDM signal detection method","time-varying channels","channel status information","finite alphabet","finite number","multipath channels","total-variation regularization","image processing area","image denoising","inter-carrier-interferences","least-square detection method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349119","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349119.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic channel tracking and signal detection for multi-carrier transmissions over high-mobility radio channels","abstract":"Adding into the cluster of available detection schemes designed for scenarios where user terminals are highly mobile, this paper describes a semi-self-recovery OFDM signal detection method for rapidly time-varying channels. The proposed algorithm does not assume the channel status information (CSI) at the receiver, it tracks the channel variation while detecting the data symbols. The key feature of the scheme is that it exploits both the finite alphabet (FA) property of the symbols and the finite number of the discrete significant signal replicas over multipath channels. Characteristically, it judiciously utilizes a total-variation regularization (TVR) and iteratively enforces FA property to gain the accuracy of the channel tracking. TVR was widely applied in the image processing area for image denoising. In the proposed method for multi-carrier transmissions, it is found very effective to properly employ TVR in suppressing the spurious components in the estimated channel coefficients. As a result, the algebraic method is able to well exploit the signal frame structure, it can work either in a semi-self-recovery fashion without pilot-subcarriers or work with an arbitrary pilot-subcarrier pattern. Computational simulation verifies that the proposed scheme exhibits a quick convergence, and at a benign or a high SNR case, it delivers a performance asymptotically approaching that of the inter-carrier-interferences (ICI) mitigating least-square detection method that ideally assumes perfect CSI at the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349119/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006376","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic channel tracking and signal detection for multi-carrier transmissions over high-mobility radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic channel tracking and signal detection for multi-carrier transmissions over high-mobility radio channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"633517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066804S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349121,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwu Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang Hong Kong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Hongwu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292097600"},{"name":"Gaojun Song","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang Hong Kong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Gaojun","lastName":"Song","id":"37535562700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349121","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Receiving antennas","Signal resolution","Particle swarm optimization","Multiaccess communication","Estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Fading","Spatial resolution","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","code division multiple access","diversity reception","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","quantum particle swarm optimization","Pareto optimality","space-time block coded-multicarrier code-division multiple-access","STBC-MC-CDMA system","independent log-likelihood function","maximum likelihood detection","spatial diversity","signal estimation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STBC-MC-CDMA","quantum","PSO","Pareto optimality"]}],"abstract":"A multiuser detection based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) with Pareto optimality is proposed for the space-time block coded-multicarrier code-division multiple-access (STBC-MC-CDMA) system.

The average bit-error rate (BER) performance of M-ary on the correlated fading channel simulated by the Kronecker model and the Weichselberger model is studied. The results show that the BLLR scheme is optimum since it minimizes the BER of MIMO system. With the same total number of antennas, the system which possesses the higher diversity order exhibits better performance. Moreover, with the same diversity order, the BER performance is improved due to the higher number of receive antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349140","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349140.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of MIMO system with transmit antenna selection based on LLR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MIMO system with transmit antenna selection based on LLR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349140/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006397","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MIMO system with transmit antenna selection based on LLR","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"610214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034795S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349143,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoli Yang","id":"37672382800"},{"name":"Xiaofang Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofang Wu","id":"37539931900"},{"name":"Jianghong Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"lastName":"Jianghong Shi","id":"37533992700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349143","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the 2D LUT (2-dimension look-up table) techniques for the mitigation of HPAs' (high power amplifiers') memory effects when transmitting WCDMA wideband signal.

In the proposed iterative scheme, not only the soft-out decision but also the channel estimations are updated in each iteration by partially combining with the former stage's counterparts.

The new scheme takes full advantage of the modulation diversity of rotated MPSK/ QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), the frequency diversity of OFDM system and the coding-gain of Turbo codes all together.

To this end, per-antenna rate control (PARC), selective-PARC (S-PARC) and dual-stream transmit antenna array (D-TxAA) are three candidate MIMO schemes. System-level evaluation for these MIMO schemes is significant for the finalization of TD-SCDMA HSPA+ standardization roadmap. Specifically, a new interface between link-level simulation and system-level simulation is required to model accurately MIMO link behavior in a system-level simulator. In this paper, we first elaborate the new simulation interface used in our simulator, and then present the performance results of these three MIMO schemes. It's shown that S-PARC can provide relatively high throughput and has low requirement on feedback overhead; therefore, it deserves more attention in TD-SCDMA HSPA+ standardization work.","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349151","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","startPage":"507","endPage":"512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level evaluation of MIMO performance in TD-HSPA+ system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System-level evaluation of MIMO performance in TD-HSPA+ system","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349151/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006408","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level evaluation of MIMO performance in TD-HSPA+ system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"60165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050015S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349152,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory Optoelect, Elect & Informat Engn Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281346300"},{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory Optoelect, Elect & Informat Engn Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37677551600"},{"name":"Yuying Li","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory Optoelect, Elect & Informat Engn Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuying","lastName":"Li","id":"37676390100"},{"name":"Junfeng Guo","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory Optoelect, Elect & Informat Engn Department, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37673704200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349152","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Traffic control","Chromium","Data communication","Channel allocation","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","Markov processes","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["priority-based variable multi-channel MAC protocols","fair channel access strategy","medium access control protocols","cooperative cognitive radio wireless networks","radio spectrum resources","Markov chain","channel competition period","shorter contention window","opportunistic spectrum access","fair spectrum allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","priority-based multi-channel MAC","opportunistic spectrum access","fair spectrum allocation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority-based variable multi-channel MAC protocols in cognitive radio wireless network: A fair channel access strategy","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","endPage":"492","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349152.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349152","startPage":"488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349152","abstract":"This paper presents a priority-based opportunistic multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocols in cooperative cognitive radio (CR) wireless networks, which used to promote the utilization of radio spectrum resources and to address the fairness issue of channel access among secondary users (SUs).

On the other hand, to ensure fairness, we prioritize the secondary users in the light of their contribution to cooperative spectrum sensing and their amount of traffic as well as the traffic's urgency.

Simulation results showed that these schemes can maximize the transmission rate and guarantee the fairness of multiple secondary users under the interference power constraint.","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349158","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349158.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation for OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349158/","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation for OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006415","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349158/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier and power allocation for OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"507192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083052S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349160,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Hou","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Hua Hou","id":"37652966700"},{"name":"Zhihua Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Zhihua Li","id":"37675290800"},{"name":"Pei Sun","affiliation":["Hebei Broadcasting&TV Network Group, Handan Company Limited, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Pei Sun","id":"37668344500"},{"name":"Dong Cui","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Dong Cui","id":"37547917100"},{"name":"Wuyang Zhou","affiliation":["Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Department of EEIS, USTC, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Wuyang Zhou","id":"37435288500"},{"name":"Yahui Yan","affiliation":["Xinxing Hebei Engineering and Research Inc.orporation Limited, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Yahui Yan","id":"37671718200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349160","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer resource management","cognitive radio system","subcarrier allocation","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Primary users","Secondary users","Utility function","QoS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349160","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349160","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","abstract":"Three new cross-layer resource manage schemes are proposed in this paper, which are from the aspects of decreasing the number of subcarriers allocated to primary users, increasing the probability that one subcarrier is shared between a primary user and a secondary user, as well as, effective tradeoff between the above two schemes through the design of utility function.

Given a licensed channel, the desirable level of detection quality can be achieved by physical-layer sensing algorithms. Furthermore, given multiple licensed channels, more available spectrum opportunities can be found through efficient MAC-layer sensing schemes. An important issue on MAC-layer sensing is how often to sense the availability of licensed channels. To resolve this issue, we focus on how to maximize utilization of spectrum opportunities by optimizing sensing periods of licensed channels. Specifically, an adaptive sensing period algorithm is proposed to realize the automatic adjusting of sensing periods based on the channel-usage model of licensed users. Simulations are used for performance evaluation. It is demonstrated that our proposed algorithm always has steady performance, regardless of the number of channels sensed. Simulation results also illustrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed algorithm over fix sensing period method. For the simulated scenarios, the proposed algorithm utilizes 15~20% more opportunities than fix sensing period method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349162/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11006419","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349162/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive sensing period algorithm in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive sensing period algorithm in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"50352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05381S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349167,"authors":[{"name":"Yixue Lei","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yixue Lei","id":"37673800700"},{"name":"Yongsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongsheng Zhang","id":"37538316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349167","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":687},"abstract":"Femto cells will be adopted in LTE to provide indoor coverage, and CSG (closed subscriber group) will be supported for service provisioning.

One of the challenges of OFDMA systems is the interference at the cell edge where users are likely to get high interference from neighbouring cells. In a network with non-uniform traffic distribution, the problem becomes even more challenging. In this paper, a semi-smart antenna based resource allocation scheme is proposed for the LTE OFDMA system. The scheme features a centralised genetic algorithm (GA) algorithm that changes the cellular coverage in a coordinated manner to improve the system capacity and mitigate network interference. Simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the results showing significant performance improvement in terms of total traffic load achieved for all cells compared to a system with fixed coverage pattern.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent resource optimisation using semi-smart antennas in LTE OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349214","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5339381/5349050/05349214.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent resource optimisation using semi-smart antennas in LTE OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349214/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent resource optimisation using semi-smart antennas in LTE OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"223558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063295S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349216,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Bai","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yong Bai","id":"37289894700"},{"name":"Juejia Zhou","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Juejia Zhou","id":"37404018900"},{"name":"Lan Chen","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lan Chen","id":"37292795300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349216","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Proposals","Interference","Throughput","Area measurement","Laboratories","Poles and towers","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Radio network","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid spectrum sharing","macrocell","femtocell","shared spectrum usage","partitioned spectrum usage"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates flexible spectrum sharing for coexistence of macrocell and femtocell.

MBER equalizers are trained online by restarted BFGS algorithm, and the results show that its convergence rate is much faster than that of stochastic gradient algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349232/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006489","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Volterra equalizers based on MBER and restarted BFGS algorithm for nonlinear channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volterra equalizers based on MBER and restarted BFGS algorithm for nonlinear channels","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"20553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068655S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5339381","isNumber":"5349050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5339381","xplore-issue":"5349050","articleId":"5349232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5349234,"authors":[{"name":"Mingxiang Guan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Technology, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Mingxiang Guan","id":"37684263500"},{"name":"Fang Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Technology, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Fang Yuan","id":"38183111400"},{"name":"Ruichun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Technology, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Ruichun Wang","id":"37065568700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4816-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4817-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349234","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Interference","Power system modeling","Quality of service","Attenuation","Frequency","Transmitters","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference (signal)","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","WCDMA system","outer loop power control","signal interference ratio","multi-service","OLPC algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","outer loop power control","multi-service","performance"]}],"abstract":"The load will change drastically when a new user accesses the CDMA system.

Various antenna selection algorithms based on different criteria have been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a new antenna selection algorithm for MIMO spatial division multiplexing (MIMO-SDM) systems which uses the mean square error (MSE) as a criterion for selecting the best subset of transmit/receive antennas to improve the system error performance. The proposed algorithm helps to achieve lower the bit error rate (BER) for MIMO-SDM systems with linear detectors compared with the previous channel matrix norm based and signal to noise ratio (SNR) based selection algorithms. Compared with the SNR based algorithm, the proposed algorithm provides double diversity gain in receive antenna selection systems and the same diversity order but about 1 dB SNR gain in transmit antenna selection systems.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349320","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","startPage":"108","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MSE based antenna selection for MIMO-SDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MSE based antenna selection for MIMO-SDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349320/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007276","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349320/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MSE based antenna selection for MIMO-SDM systems","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055147S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5349321,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37529216500"},{"name":"Jeffrey Cohn","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Cohn","id":"37270785600"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"},{"name":"Iain Matthews","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Iain","lastName":"Matthews","id":"37281084400"},{"name":"Sridha Sridharan","affiliation":["SAIVT Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Sridha","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37266096100"},{"name":"Kenneth M.

However, if the patient is a child or has limited ability to communicate (i.e. the mute, mentally impaired, or patients having assisted breathing) self-report may not be a viable measurement. In addition, these self-report measures only relate to the maximum pain level experienced during a sequence so a frame-by-frame measure is currently not obtainable. Using image data from patients with rotator-cuff injuries, in this paper we describe an AAM-based automatic system which can detect pain on a frame-by-frame level. We do this two ways: directly (straight from the facial features); and indirectly (through the fusion of individual AU detectors). From our results, we show that the latter method achieves the optimal results as most discriminant features from each AU detector (i.e. shape or appearance) are used.","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2009.5349321","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5342220/5349257/05349321.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2009.5349321","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction and Workshops","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically detecting pain using facial actions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatically detecting pain using facial actions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349321/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007553","pubMedId":"21278824","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically detecting pain using facial actions","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067638S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5342220","isNumber":"5349257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5342220","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5349257","articleId":"5349321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5349325,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By utilizing the BSVD, transmit and receive beamformers divide the MIMO channel into some decoupled MIMO subchannels, which have different sizes. Due to flexibility in dividing the MIMO channel and applying the STC to each MIMO subchannel independently, the system can be designed based on trade off between diversity, multiplexing and complexity. Combining the dominant subspace beamformer and Alamouti STC, which is developed based on one dimensional BSVD (1D-BSVD), can be considered as one approach. To evaluate the performance of the new approach, the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed joint beamforming and ST coding is compared with the BERs of the orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) and the quasi-OSTBCs (QOSTBCs) via computer simulations. The results show that the superior performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349325","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349325.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint subspace beamforming and space-time coding in wireless MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349325/","displayDocTitle":"Joint subspace beamforming and space-time coding in wireless MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349325/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint subspace beamforming and space-time coding in wireless MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051185S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5349336,"authors":[{"name":"Van Duc Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology No.1, Dai Co Viet Road, Hanoi city, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Van Duc","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37535674900"},{"name":"Van Luong Pham","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology No.1, Dai Co Viet Road, Hanoi city, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Van Luong","lastName":"Pham","id":"37087876701"},{"name":"Van Xiem Hoang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology No.1, Dai Co Viet Road, Hanoi city, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Van Xiem","lastName":"Hoang","id":"37087878484"},{"name":"Huy Dung Han","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi city, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Huy Dung","lastName":"Han","id":"38255962000"},{"name":"Huu Thanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi city, Viet Nam"],"firstName":"Huu Thanh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38238891500"},{"name":"Tien Hoa Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Leibniz University of Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Tien Hoa","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38184430800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5139-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"5349336","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"abstract":"In this paper, we present the implementation of an OFDM system based on the TMS320C6416 DSP.

Three noise scenarios, namely \u00bfheavily disturbed\u00bf, \u00bfmedium disturbed\u00bf and \u00bfweakly disturbed\u00bf, that are based on practical measurements are used to investigate the performance of clipping technique before and after employing the proposed adaptive threshold by means of computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349349","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349349.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-threshold clipping for impulsive noise reduction in OFDM-based power line Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-threshold clipping for impulsive noise reduction in OFDM-based power line Communications","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007288","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-threshold clipping for impulsive noise reduction in OFDM-based power line Communications","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087383S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5349350,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Eyben","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Eyben","id":"37542054600"},{"name":"Martin W\u00f6llmer","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"W\u00f6llmer","id":"37542055400"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Schuller","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37283946000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4800-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4799-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8103"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8111"}],"articleNumber":"5349350","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":167,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1912},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349350","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Open source software","Emotion recognition","Engines","Speech recognition","Speech processing","Automatic speech recognition","Software packages","Audio recording","Feature extraction","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","emotion recognition","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpenEAR","Munich open-source emotion recognition","affect recognition toolkit","speech recognition","speech processing","audio recording","audio file reading","paralinguistic feature extraction","plugable classification module"]}],"abstract":"Various open-source toolkits exist for speech recognition and speech processing.

BAC includes an iterative process of renormalization with up to seven iterations for coding each symbol. Since BAC is also a computational intensive unit in H.264 encoder, various hardware realizations have been proposed for it in the literature. In this paper, we propose a hardware implementation for BAC, which uses lookup table to avoid the iterative coding process and achieves coding rate of one symbol per clock at 260 MHz clock rate.

They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of psychological disorder, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. We compared clinical diagnosis of major depression with automatically measured facial actions and vocal prosody in patients undergoing treatment for depression. Manual FACS coding, active appearance modeling (AAM) and pitch extraction were used to measure facial and vocal expression. Classifiers using leave-one-out validation were SVM for FACS and for AAM and logistic regression for voice. Both face and voice demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with depression. Accuracy in detecting depression was 88% for manual FACS and 79% for AAM. Accuracy for vocal prosody was 79%. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic detection of depression, raise new issues in automated facial image analysis and machine learning, and have exciting implications for clinical

has a big effect on communication systems. Estimation of frequency offset is becoming an important, urgent, and practical issue needed to be cared for, especially in multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) systems. The fact shows that an inaccurate frequency offset estimate will reduce the accuracy of other system parameter estimates, which diminishes the expected spectral efficiency of the MIMO antenna system. Regarding to this problem, two algorithm candidates are presented to estimate carrier frequency offset exactly in a MIMO system in this paper. While the first one focus on matrix algorithm, the second one which is more complicated is a subspace-based approach called MUSIC (MUtilple SIgnal Classification) to overcome the limit of DFT resolution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Candidates for estimating carrier frequency offset in MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349369","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349369.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Candidates for estimating carrier frequency offset in MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349369/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007292","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Candidates for estimating carrier frequency offset in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0877S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5349370,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), College of Science and Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbahua","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbahua","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5139-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"5349370","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system security","Information security","Wireless communication","Data security","Telecommunication network reliability","Fading","AWGN","Electronic mail","Public key cryptography","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cryptographic protocols","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless physical-layer security","wireless communication network privacy","wireless communication network security","cryptographic protocols","error free link","ad-hoc networks","decentralized networks","higher-layer techniques","physical-layer security","encryption"]}],"abstract":"The issues of privacy and security in wireless communication networks have taken on an increasingly important role as these networks continue to flourish worldwide. Traditionally, security is viewed as an independent feature addressed above the physical-layer and all widely used cryptographic protocols are designed and implemented assuming the physical-layer has already been established and provides an error free link. However, with the emergence of ad-hoc and decentralized networks, higher-layer techniques, such as encryption, are complex and hard to be implemented. Therefore, there has been a recent attention on studying the fundamental ability of the physical-layer to provide secure wireless communications. In this contribution, we discuss the challenges ahead in implementing wireless physical-layer security.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349370","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349370.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless physical-layer security: The challenges ahead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless physical-layer security: The challenges ahead","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349370/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007293","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349370/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless physical-layer security: The challenges ahead","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085251S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349374,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Nakagawa","affiliation":["Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37393727900"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Mitsuyama","affiliation":["Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Mitsuyama","id":"37396108100"},{"name":"Kohei Kambara","affiliation":["Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohei","lastName":"Kambara","id":"37411344800"},{"name":"Tetsuomi Ikeda","affiliation":["Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuomi","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37404456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5139-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"5349374","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","MIMO","Convolutional codes","Space technology","OFDM","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Roads","Communications technology","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STTC-MIMO-OFDM performance","16-QAM space time trellis code","transmitting antennas","outdoor mobile transmission","bit error rate","BER","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","bandwidth 800 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["16-QAM","STTC","MIMO","OFDM","experiment"]}],"abstract":"A 64-state 16-QAM space-time trellis code (STTC), which uses two transmitting antennas, is proposed and applied to a 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM system for outdoor mobile transmission in the 800-MHz band.

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic frequency controller (AFC) scheme with time diversity combining. The proposed AFC generates the frequency error signal based on the time diversity combined signal. The signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of the frequency error signal is therefore prevented from falling to zero even in the condition of signal blockage. The proposed AFC thus tracks and removes the carrier frequency fluctuation due to Doppler shift more exactly than the conventional one. Results of computer simulation show that the proposed AFC improves the SNR of the frequency error signal significantly.

It is a widely accepted assumption that using multi-hopping in cellular networks will increase the cellular throughput. There are several advantages of MCN such as the improved signal quality and higher coverage. Finding an available relaying path is a critical prerequisite for the success of the multi-hop cellular networks and has a great impact on the network throughput. Most works use signal strength, distance and power consumption as routing criteria, but the effect of interference specially intercell interference does not take into account in routing algorithms. For this reason, in this paper interference is calculated at any receiver during the uplink, and a novel routing scheme based on minimum interference and best link gain in each hop, is proposed.

However, wireless devices such as mobile phones cannot have more than one antenna because of limits on size and complexity. Recently, cooperative communications have been proposed to create virtual antenna systems for circumventing this problem. This technique achieves a diversity gain by using a combination of the relayed signal and the direct signal. Here, we use a dual optimization method for non-convex problems to jointly optimize the power allocation and the scheduling of wireless cooperative OFDM systems. We find the optimal solution, and confirm our analysis by numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349432.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint optimization of power allocation and cooperation in wireless OFDM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Base stations","Mobile communication","Power system relaying","Wireless networks","Rayleigh channels","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","OFDM modulation","telecommunication power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint optimization","power allocation","wireless OFDM networks","transmit diversity","mobile phones","cooperative communications","virtual antenna systems","diversity gain","dual optimization method","nonconvex problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","cooperative communications","power allocation","scheduling","optimization","relay strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimization of power allocation and cooperation in wireless OFDM networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349432/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007309","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimization of power allocation and cooperation in wireless OFDM networks","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069508S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349437,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdizadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Abdizadeh","id":"37398979700"},{"name":"Ali Jafarnia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Jafarnia","id":"37403332800"},{"name":"Hadi Jamali Rad","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi Jamali","lastName":"Rad","id":"37398982600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5139-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"5349437","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Telecommunication network reliability","Power system reliability","Base stations","Power control","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mean square error methods","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser precoding","power allocation","downlink","cooperative CDMA networks","mobile terminals","base station","multiple-access interference","multiuser transmitter precoding","minimum mean-square error"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the downlink of cooperative Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) systems, where a set of Mobile Terminals (MT) cooperate with the purpose of improving their downlink communications reliability with Base Station (BS). For combating Multiple-Access Interference (MAI) as well as transferring complexity and spatial processing from the mobile terminals to the transmitter of BS, multiuser transmitter precoding is considered. In addition to multiuser precoding based on Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) criterion for mitigating MAI, the proper transmission power control strategy under a fixed total power constraint is proposed and analyzed. Compared with equal transmission power assigning, where BS and cooperative terminals transmit with the same power, the proposed power allocation scheme leads to a significant performance gain at the destination.

Two concepts of center-ray tube and lateral-ray tube are defined and then compared in different aspects of accuracy and computational time wherein the use of lateral-ray tube revealed as important step forward in ray tracing accuracy but more time consuming. An acceleration technique developed based on ray tubes coherency that deals with ray-sharing characteristic of tube. New concept of two-ray tube tracing (TRTT) benefiting four-ray tube configuration is presented. A computational procedure developed to implement TRTT technique for simulation of wave propagating through large complex three-dimensional (3D) objects. To verify accuracy of presented TRTT technique and relevant computational procedure, a simple 4 buildings scenario analyzed using CST MICROWAVE STUDIO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00ae</sup>\n. Moreover, field measurement values and TRTT simulation results compared in an urban environment on 910 MHz. The good agreement between simulation results and the measurements validates presented technique. Consequently, proposed technique provides an efficient ray tracing method while retains same accuracy as for four-ray tube launching. Moreover, this method can be used for evaluation of wireless channel characteristics by providing enough 3D information of tube configuration for 3D analysis of environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for

this paper, we investigate the aggregate throughput and proportional fairness of two independent secondary user (SU) groups in a cognitive radio (CR) network. Using a continuous time Markov chain, the expression for the aggregate throughput as a function of traffic intensity, forced termination and blocking probabilities is derived. Furthermore, throughput loss of the individual SU groups is analyzed in terms of proportional fairness. The results show that as the difference between the service rates increases the fairness deviates from its ideal value and this unfairness cannot be countered by changing the arrival/access rate of SUs. For the fixed arrival rate of SU groups there exists an optimal service rate pair which maximize the aggregate throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11007317","htmlLink":"/document/5349453/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and proportional fairness in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and proportional fairness in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087549S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5349463,"authors":[{"name":"Le-Nam Tran","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Le-Nam","lastName":"Tran","id":"37400803900"},{"name":"Een-Kee Hong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Een-Kee","lastName":"Hong","id":"37354825400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5139-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"5349463","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity scheduling algorithms for successive zero-forcing dirty paper coded systems","abstract":"Dirty paper coding scheme (DPC) is known to be a capacity achieving transmission technique in downlink multiuser MIMO channels. As a suboptimal solution to DPC, a precoding technique called successive zero-forcing dirty paper coding (SZF-DPC) has been proposed recently. The condition for the existence of the precoding matrices in SZF-DPC restricts the capability of supporting multiple users simultaneously. Thus, a user scheduling algorithm is needed to achieve multiuser diversity in SZF-DPC as the number of users grows. In this paper, we propose three low-complexity suboptimal scheduling algorithms to exploit the multi-user diversity gain for SZF-DPC. The first algorithm greedily maximizes the true sum capacity. The second algorithm is based on eigenvalues that are closely related to the true capacity. The third algorithm relies on the diagonal elements of the effective channel matrix since we realize a strong relationship between the eigenvalues and diagonal entries of a Hermitian matrix. Simulation results of several cases show that the proposed scheduling algorithms can obtain a significant fraction of sum capacity of the optimal solution.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5341812/5349254/05349463.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2009.5349463","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2009.5349463","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349463","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Downlink","Power system reliability","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Paper technology","Diversity methods","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","Hermitian matrices","MIMO communication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity scheduling algorithms","zero-forcing dirty paper coded systems","dirty paper coding scheme","capacity achieving transmission technique","downlink multiuser MIMO channels","preceding matrices","Hermitian matrix","multiple-input multiple-output systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349463/","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity scheduling algorithms for successive zero-forcing dirty paper coded systems","accessionNumber":"11007318","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349463/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity scheduling algorithms for successive zero-forcing dirty paper coded systems","confLoc":"Hai Phong, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040652S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5341812","isNumber":"5349254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5341812","xplore-issue":"5349254","articleId":"5349463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349466,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The novelty of this paper is to introduce a Bayesian classification framework for affective video tagging that allows taking contextual information into account. A set of 21 full length movies was first segmented and informative content-based features were extracted from each shot and scene. Shots were then emotionally annotated, providing ground truth affect. The arousal of shots was computed using a linear regression on the content-based features. Bayesian classification based on the shots arousal and content-based features allowed tagging these scenes into three affective classes, namely calm, positive excited and negative excited. To improve classification accuracy, two contextual priors have been proposed: the movie genre prior, and the temporal dimension prior consisting of the probability of transition between emotions in consecutive scenes. The f1 classification measure of 54.9% that was obtained on three emotional classes with a nai\u00bfve Bayes classifier was improved to 63.4% after utilizing all the priors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5349563/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007516","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian framework for video affective representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian framework for video affective representation","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110931S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5342220","isNumber":"5349257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5342220","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5349257","articleId":"5349563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5349613,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Safavieh","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Safavieh","id":"37568214000"},{"name":"Amin Gheibi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Gheibi","id":"37670646300"},{"name":"Mohammadreza Abolghasemi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Abolghasemi","id":"38560402500"},{"name":"Ali Mohades","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mohades","id":"37542536000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4261-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4262-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349613","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Topology","Optimization methods","Evolutionary computation","Mathematics","Computer science","Laboratories","Computational geometry","Linear programming","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","Voronoi neighborhood","dynamic geometric neighborhood","Voronoi diagram","geometric naturalistic method","dynamic Euclidean"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349613","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an optimization method that is inspired by nature and is used frequently nowadays.

Optimal assignment of tasks to a multiprocessor is an NP-hard problem in general cases, and precedence task graph makes it more complex. Many factors affect optimal tasks allocation.

Due to high sensitivity of `time' in real-time systems, scheduling with respect to time constraints becomes very important.

There is a growing interest in subspace learning techniques for face recognition.

In this paper, a new supervised discriminative subspace analysis is presented by encoding face image as a high order general tensor. As face space can be considered as a nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space, a decomposition method called Tucker tensor is used which can effectively decomposes this sparse space.

We aim to investigate to what extend it is effective. There is a lack of empirical data to verify the pay-offs of employing MDD tools and techniques. In order to increase the knowledge we have of the impact of MDD in large scale industrial projects, we investigate the project characteristics of a large software development project in which MDD is used in a pure form. This study focuses on analyzing model size and complexity and metrics related to model quality and effort. Furthermore, project team members were asked to elaborate on their views on the impact of using MDD. Our findings include that larger models are more complex, contain more diagrams, are changed more often and worked on longer but do not necessarily contain more defects. However, models that are changed often do contain more defects. Benefits mentioned by team members were an increase in productivity, benefits from a consistent implementation and their perception of improvement of overall quality. Also, a reduction in complexity was attributed to the use of MDD techniques. We could confirm the perceived increase in the quality of the product in that the average amount of defects found is significantly lower than in similar size projects in which MDD was not employed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Programming","Productivity","Software engineering","Computer science","Application software","Computer industry","Software maintenance","Software quality","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","software development management","software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed model driven development process","software engineering","software development project","software complexity","software metrics","MDD techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["model driven development","industrial case study","model metrics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SEAA.2009.70","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349834/5349835/05349868.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAA.2009.70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Investigations of Model Size, Complexity and Effort in a Large Scale, Distributed Model Driven Development Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Investigations of Model Size, Complexity and Effort in a Large Scale, Distributed Model Driven Development Process","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349868/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349868/","accessionNumber":"11006540","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Investigations of Model Size, Complexity and Effort in a Large Scale, Distributed Model Driven Development Process","confLoc":"Patras, Greece","sourcePdf":"3784a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128271S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5349834","isNumber":"5349835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5349834","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5349835","articleId":"5349868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5349924,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwen Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent, Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37671184100"},{"name":"Yue Ma","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent, Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37671221300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4746-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3767-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"5349924","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349924","abstract":"As a kind of service selection algorithm, genetic algorithm is a good way to select an optimal composite plan from many composite plans. Including crossover operation, mutation operation and selection operation, all the executions of GA rely on a randomly search procedure to seek the area of possible solutions. But, bad convergence and prematurity phenomenon of GA are produced by random sequences generation. They have become the obstacle for GA's further application. To improve the convergence of genetic algorithm (GA) for Web service selection with global quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, chaos theory is introduced into the genetic algorithm with the relation matrix coding scheme. These chaotic laws are all based on the relation matrix coding scheme. During crossover and mutation process phases, chaotic time series are adopted instead of random ones. The effect of chaotic sequences and random ones is compared during several numerical tests. And, the performance of GA using chaotic time series and random ones is investigated. The simulation results on Web service selection with global QoS constraints have shown that the proposed strategy based on chaotic sequences can enhance GA's convergence capability. The fitness is also improved after the chaotic approaches are introduced.","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2009.14","startPage":"410","endPage":"416","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349785/5349786/05349924.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for QoS-Aware Web Service Selection Based on Chaotic Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Web services","Chaos","Quality of service","Genetic mutations","Laboratories","Intelligent networks","Multimedia systems","Random sequences","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","matrix algebra","quality of service","random processes","time series","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","QoS-aware Web service selection","chaotic sequences","crossover operation","mutation operation","selection operation","random sequences generation","quality-of-service","relation matrix coding scheme","chaotic time series","global QoS constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for QoS-Aware Web Service Selection Based on Chaotic Sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349924/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007680","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm for QoS-Aware Web Service Selection Based on Chaotic Sequences","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"3767a410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068959S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5349785","isNumber":"5349786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5349785","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5349786","articleId":"5349924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5349948,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen Strunk","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Group, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Strunk","id":"37584455700"},{"name":"Toni Volkmer","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Group, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Volkmer","id":"37572393100"},{"name":"Wolfgang Rehm","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Group, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Rehm","id":"37267026100"},{"name":"Heiko Schick","affiliation":["IBM Deutschland Research and Development GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Schick","id":"37403363400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3782-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5349948","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Field programmable gate arrays","Runtime","Delay","Silicon","Communication networks","Communication channels","Interference","Concurrent computing","Embedded computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","grid computing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run time reconfigurable low latency grid communication","on chip communication network","partially reconfigurable FPGA","run time reconfigurable module","dedicated silicon network","intercommunicating offload compute kernel","host coupled FPGA accelerator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","run-time reconfiguration","dynamic and partial reconfiguration","NoC","Network on Chip"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a low latency, on chip communication network (NoC) for a run-time reconfigurable (RTR) grid inside dynamically and partially reconfigurable (DPR) FPGAs is proposed, which supports the arbitrary placement of run-time reconfigurable modules (RTRM) inside the grid. The dedicated, fully meshed, silicon network should support the arrangement of communication channels between the RTRMs within the different partially reconfigurable regions (PRRs) on the FPGA. The design of the network guarantees a low latency communication of RTRMs without mutual interference of each other. In comparison with an implementation using FPGA resources the dedicated silicon network could save an huge amount of resources in terms of transistors. The new degree of parallel communication provided for a RTR grid with arbitrarily placeable RTRMs offers new application fields for DPR capable FPGAs. Multiple user applications with inter-communicating offload compute kernels can be loaded on a host coupled FPGA accelerator, a real-time (RT) system with concurrent communication tasks are possible and enhancing the functionality on demand for embedded systems is conceivable. A case study was conducted for proof of concept and for the verification of the run-time environment system, which manages the configurable network.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2009.133","publicationTitle":"2009 12th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design, Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design, Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349946/5349947/05349948.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2009.133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on Chip Network inside a FPGA for Run-Time Reconfigurable Low Latency Grid Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349948/","displayDocTitle":"An on Chip Network inside a FPGA for Run-Time Reconfigurable Low Latency Grid Communication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349948/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006597","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on Chip Network inside a FPGA for Run-Time Reconfigurable Low Latency Grid Communication","confLoc":"Patras, Greece","sourcePdf":"3782a539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052771S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5349946","isNumber":"5349947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5349946","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349947","articleId":"5349948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5349953,"authors":[{"name":"Jarno V\u00e4h\u00e4niitty","affiliation":["Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarno","lastName":"V\u00e4h\u00e4niitty","id":"37398820200"},{"name":"Casper Lassenius","affiliation":["Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Casper","lastName":"Lassenius","id":"37265140400"},{"name":"Kristian Rautiainen","affiliation":["Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Rautiainen","id":"37303434100"},{"name":"Pasi Pekkanen","affiliation":["Software Business and Engineering Institute, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Pasi","lastName":"Pekkanen","id":"37670943000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3784-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-6503"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-9505"}],"articleNumber":"5349953","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"abstract":"Success in the software product business requires timely release of new products and upgrades with proper quality and the right features. For this, a systematic approach for managing the contents, timing and roles of future product releases as well as the product architecture is needed. In practice, such an approach is often missing, especially in small companies, due to inexperience, unclear priorities, time-to-market pressures, or the lack of suitable process infra-structure. In this paper, we present a model to visualize product roadmaps developed together with three small software companies and experiences from its use. The model depicts release and development schedules, the composition of individual releases, services that require attention from the developers, changes to the underlying technology and the planned resource usage. We also present lessons learned from the case companies and outline directions for future research.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 35th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349834/5349835/05349953.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"2009 35th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","doi":"10.1109/SEAA.2009.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAA.2009.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-Term Planning of Development Efforts by Roadmapping \u2013 A Model and Experiences from Small Software Companies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software quality","Companies","Technology planning","Programming","Product development","Computer architecture","Visualization","Time to market","Software engineering","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","planning","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software companies","software product business","systematic approach","product architecture","product roadmap visualization","long-term planning","software development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["roadmapping","software development","small company"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Long-Term Planning of Development Efforts by Roadmapping \u2013 A Model and Experiences from Small Software Companies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"11006560","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-Term Planning of Development Efforts by Roadmapping \u2013 A Model and Experiences from Small Software Companies","confLoc":"Patras, Greece","sourcePdf":"3784a300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053974S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5349834","isNumber":"5349835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5349834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5349835","articleId":"5349953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":5349954,"authors":[{"name":"Qifeng Lu","affiliation":["Center for Geospatial Information Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Alexandria, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Qifeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37398733300"},{"name":"Yao Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37401143800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4746-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3767-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"5349954","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Spatial resolution","Training data","Signal resolution","Data mining","Clustering algorithms","Machine learning","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution learning","neural network classifiers","generalization performance","agglomerative hierarchical clustering","coarser resolution training data generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","feature extraction","hierarchical clustering","spatial entropy","spatial information gain","multiresolution learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349954","abstract":"One of the most crucial challenges for classifiers is generalization. In this paper, we present a novel and systematic multiresolution learning approach for neural network classifiers to improve their generalization performance on classification tasks with feature based input space. The proposed approach adopts agglomerative hierarchical clustering to generate coarser resolution training data from the original data because hierarchical clustering captures the detailed structure of clustering for any given data set in feature space, and an effective algorithm is developed to automatically extract critical coarser resolution levels for each class. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated through experiments on six real-world benchmark data sets, where traditional learning (i.e., single resolution learning) is used as the baseline. The empirical results demonstrate that multiresolution learning significantly improves neural network classifiers' generalization performance when compared to the baseline, especially for very difficult tasks.","doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2009.83","startPage":"505","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2009.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349786","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349785/5349786/05349954.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Learning on Neural Network Classifiers: A Systematic Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5349954/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution Learning on Neural Network Classifiers: A Systematic Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5349954/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11007695","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution Learning on Neural Network Classifiers: A Systematic Approach","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"3767a505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081759S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5349785","isNumber":"5349786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5349785","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5349786","articleId":"5349954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5349965,"authors":[{"name":"Katsuyoshi Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems Graduate School of Engineering, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuyoshi","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37307631200"},{"name":"Minoru Uehara","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems Graduate School of Engineering, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37277097700"},{"name":"Hideki Mori","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems Graduate School of Engineering, Toyo University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Mori","id":"37277104900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4746-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3767-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"5349965","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5349965","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Counting circuits","Cellular neural networks","Circuit faults","Fault tolerance","Radiation detectors","Image processing","Information systems","Humidity","Equations","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small-world cellular neural networks","stateful reliability counter evaluation","fault tolerant techniques","image processing","error propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NBiS.2009.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/5349785/5349786/05349965.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems","startPage":"440","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5349786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2009.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Stateful Reliability Counter in Small-World Cellular Neural Networks","abstract":"In this paper, fault tolerant techniques and the evaluation results for the small world cellular network are described.
