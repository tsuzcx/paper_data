The mother wavelet and the basis of wavelet packets were optimized and the wavelet coefficients were encoded with a modified version of the embedded zerotree algorithm. This signal dependant compression scheme was designed by a two-step process. The first (internal optimization) was the best basis selection that was performed for a given mother wavelet. For this purpose, three additive cost functions were applied and compared. The second (external optimization) was the selection of the mother wavelet based on the minimal distortion of the decoded signal given a fixed compression ratio. The mother wavelet was parameterized in the multiresolution analysis framework by the scaling filter, which is sufficient to define the entire decomposition in the orthogonal case. The method was tested on two sets of ten electromyographic (EMG) and ten electrocardiographic (ECG) signals that were compressed with compression ratios in the range of 50%-90%. For 90% compression ratio of EMG (ECG) signals, the percent residual difference after compression decreased from (mean ) 48.69.9% (21.58.4%) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using the wavelet leading to poorest performance to 28.43.0% (6.71.9%) with DWPT, with optimal basis selection and wavelet optimization. In conclusion, best basis selection and optimization of the mother wavelet through parameterization led to substantial improvement of performance in signal compression with respect to DWT and randon selection of the mother wavelet. The method provides an adaptive approach for optimal signal representation for compression and can thus be applied to any type of biomedical signal.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.896596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4376250/04360002.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.896596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"2186","endPage":"2192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression of Biomedical Signals With Mother Wavelet Optimization and Best-Basis Wavelet Packet Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Compression of Biomedical Signals With Mother Wavelet Optimization and Best-Basis Wavelet Packet Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360002/","volume":"54","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4360002/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671783","pubMedId":"18075034","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of Biomedical Signals With Mother Wavelet Optimization and Best-Basis Wavelet Packet Selection","sourcePdf":"54tbme12-brechet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082723S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4376250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4376250","articleId":"4360002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4360033,"authors":[{"name":"Gernot R.

They are used in a broad field of applications nowadays. One important issue is the control of neuroprosthetic devices for the restoration of the grasp function in spinal-cord-injured people. In this communication, an asynchronous (self-paced) four-class BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) was used to control a two-axes electrical hand prosthesis. During training, four healthy participants reached an online classification accuracy between 44% and 88%. Controlling the prosthetic hand asynchronously, the participants reached a performance of 75.5 to 217.5 s to copy a series of movements, whereas the fastest possible duration determined by the setup was 64 s. The number of false negative (FN) decisions varied from 0 to 10 (the maximal possible decisions were 34). It can be stated that the SSVEP-based BCI, operating in an asynchronous mode, is feasible for the control of neuroprosthetic devices with the flickering lights mounted on its surface.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9756926","htmlLink":"/document/4360033/","pubMedId":"18232384","displayDocTitle":"Control of an Electrical Prosthesis With an SSVEP-Based BCI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of an Electrical Prosthesis With an SSVEP-Based BCI","sourcePdf":"55tbme01-mullerputz-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051471S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4404080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"360","xplore-issue":"4404080","articleId":"4360033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4360034,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Sameni","affiliation":["Laboratory of Grenoble Image Parole Signal Automatique (GIPSA), Institute National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France","Biomedical Signal and Image Processing Laboratory (BiSIPL), School of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4376250/4360034/4360034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Sameni (S'05) was born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1977.

The necessary dynamic models of the ECG are based on a modified nonlinear dynamic model, previously suggested for the generation of a highly realistic synthetic ECG. A modified version of this model is used in several Bayesian filters, including the Extended Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Smoother, and Unscented Kalman Filter. An automatic parameter selection method is also introduced, to facilitate the adaptation of the model parameters to a vast variety of ECGs. This approach is evaluated on several normal ECGs, by artificially adding white and colored Gaussian noises to visually inspected clean ECG recordings, and studying the SNR and morphology of the filter outputs. The results of the study demonstrate superior results compared with conventional ECG denoising approaches such as bandpass filtering, adaptive filtering, and wavelet denoising, over a wide range of ECG SNRs. The method is also successfully evaluated on real nonstationary muscle artifact. This method may therefore serve as an effective framework for the model-based filtering of noisy ECG recordings.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.897817","startPage":"2172","endPage":"2185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.897817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4376250/04360034.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering Framework for ECG Denoising","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360034/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering Framework for ECG Denoising","volume":"54","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4360034/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9674299","pubMedId":"18075033","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering Framework for ECG Denoising","sourcePdf":"54tbme12-sameni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11525S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4376250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"314","xplore-issue":"4376250","articleId":"4360034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4360050,"authors":[{"name":"Jessi E.

The near-rectangular induced electric field pulses use 2%-34% less energy and generate 67%-72% less coil heating compared to matched conventional cosine pulses. CTMS is used to stimulate rhesus monkey motor cortex in vivo with PWs of 20 to 100 mus, demonstrating the expected decrease of threshold pulse amplitude with increasing PW.

Although the field of sensitivity analysis is well developed, systematic application of such methods to complex biological models is limited due to the associated high computational costs and the substantial technical challenges for implementation. In the specific case of the forward problem in electrocardiography, the lack of robust, feasible, and comprehensive sensitivity analysis has left many aspects of the problem unresolved and subject to empirical and intuitive evaluation rather than sound, quantitative investigation. In this study, we have developed a systematic, stochastic approach to the analysis of sensitivity of the forward problem of electrocardiography to the parameter of inhomogeneous tissue conductivity. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional, inhomogeneous, geometric model of a slice through the human thorax. We assigned probability density functions for various organ conductivities and applied \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">stochastic finite elements</i>\n based on the generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) method to obtain the standard deviation of the resulting stochastic torso potentials. This method utilizes a spectral representation of the stochastic process to obtain numerically accurate stochastic solutions in a fraction of the time required when employing classic Monte Carlo methods. We have shown that a systematic study of sensitivity is not only easily feasible with the gPC-SG approach but can also provide valuable insight into characteristics of the specific simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4404080/04360056.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.900563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.900563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4404080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Stochastic Finite Element Methods to Study the Sensitivity of ECG Forward Modeling to Organ Conductivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Finite element methods","Electrocardiography","Conductivity","Biological system modeling","Sensitivity analysis","Numerical simulation","Computational modeling","Systematics","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biological tissues","electrocardiography","finite element analysis","Galerkin method","sensitivity analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic finite element method","ECG forward modeling","organ conductivity","sensitivity analysis","electrocardiography","inhomogeneous tissue conductivity","human thorax","probability density function","generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic Galerkin method","stochastic torso potential","Monte Carlo method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrocardiographic forward problem","polynomial chaos","stochastic finite elements","stochastic Galerkin","stochastic processes","uncertainty quantification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Body Surface Potential Mapping","Computer Simulation","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electric Conductivity","Electrocardiography","Finite Element Analysis","Heart Conduction System","Humans","Models, Cardiovascular","Models, Statistical","Stochastic Processes"]},{"kwd":["electrocardiographic forward problem","stochastic finite elements","polynomial chaos","stochastic Galerkin","stochastic processes","uncertainty quantification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of Stochastic Finite Element Methods to Study the Sensitivity of ECG Forward Modeling to Organ Conductivity","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4360056/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9743173","pubMedId":"18232344","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Stochastic Finite Element Methods to Study the Sensitivity of ECG Forward Modeling to Organ Conductivity","sourcePdf":"55tbme01-geneser.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144839S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4404080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4404080","articleId":"4360056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4360057,"authors":[{"name":"Shakti K.

In this paper, we numerically investigate the feasibility of using multichannel microwave backscatter in the 1-11 GHz band to classify the salient features of a dielectric target. We consider targets with three shape characteristics: smooth, microlobulated, and spiculated; and four size categories ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter. The numerical target constructs are based on Gaussian random spheres allowing for moderate shape irregularities. We perform shape and size classification for a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to demonstrate the potential for tumor characterization based on ultrawideband (UWB) microwave backscatter. We approach classification with two basis selection methods from the literature: local discriminant bases and principal component analysis. Using these methods, we construct linear classifiers where a subset of the bases expansion vectors are the input features and we evaluate the average rate of correct classification as a performance measure. We demonstrate that for 10 dB SNR, the target size is very reliably classified with over 97% accuracy averaged over 360 targets; target shape is classified with over 70% accuracy. The relationship between the SNR of the test data and classifier performance is also explored. The results of this study are very encouraging and suggest that both shape and size characteristics of a dielectric target can be classified directly from its UWB backscatter. Hence, characterization can easily be performed in conjunction with UWB radar-based breast cancer detection without requiring any special hardware or additional data collection.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.900564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4404080/04360057.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4404080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.900564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Breast Tumor Characterization Based on Ultrawideband Microwave Backscatter","volume":"55","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4360057/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9743169","pubMedId":"18232367","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360057/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast Tumor Characterization Based on Ultrawideband Microwave Backscatter","sourcePdf":"55tbme01-davis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082429S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4404080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4404080","articleId":"4360057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":4360068,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan J.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality that determines the impedance distribution within tissue and has been used in prior work to map the electrical properties of breast at signal frequencies ranging from a few kHz to 1 MHz. It has been suggested that by extending the frequency range, additional information of clinical significance may be obtained. We have, therefore, developed a new EIT system for breast imaging which covers the frequency range from 10 kHz to 10 MHz. The instrument developed here is a distributed processor tomograph with 64 channels, capable of generating and measuring voltages and currents. Electrical benchmarking has shown the system to have a SNR greater than 94 dB up to 2 MHz, 90 dB up to 7 MHz, and 65 dB at 10 MHz. In addition, the system measures impedances to an accuracy of 99.7% and has channel-to-channel variations of less than 0.05%. Phantom imaging has demonstrated the ability to image across the entire frequency range in both single-and multiplane configurations. Further, 96 women have participated safely in breast exams with the system and the associated conductivity spectra obtained from 3-D image reconstructions range from 0.0237 S/m at 10 kHz to 0.2174 S/m at 10 MHz. These findings are consistent with impedance values reported in the literature.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.903516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","startPage":"650","endPage":"659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360068.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Broadband High-Frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography System for Breast Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4360068/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Broadband High-Frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography System for Breast Imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748171","pubMedId":"18270001","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Broadband High-Frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography System for Breast Imaging","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-halter-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13878S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4360072,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00c9line Moulin","affiliation":["LETI-CEA Research Technologique, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360072/4360072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9line Moulin (S'06) received the electronic engineering degree from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Chimie Physique Electronique de Lyon (CPE Lyon), Lyon, France, in 2003, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es (INSA) de Lyon, Lyon, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","Currently, she is responsible for the reliability growth of electronic systems for various rolling stocks at ALSTOM Transport, Villeurbanne, France."]},"firstName":"C\u00c9line","lastName":"Moulin","id":"37430784200"},{"name":"Alain Gliere","affiliation":["LETI-CEA Research Technologique, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360072/4360072-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Alain Gli\u00e8re received the electrical engineering degree, the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, and a Habilitation degree from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, in 1981, 1988, and 2006, respectively.","He has been involved in industrial and technological research projects dealing with software engineering and numerical simulation of physical phenomena (electromagnetism, computational fluid dynamics, heat transfer, radiation-matter interaction, etc.).

In comparison with a compartmental neuron model, it is shown that the thin-film approximation-based model is able to properly represent the neuron bioelectrical behavior in terms of transmembrane current and potential. Moreover, the model is able to simulate extracellular action potential recordings with properties similar to those observed in biological experiments. It is demonstrated that an ideal measurement system model can be used to represent the recording microelectrode, provided that the electronic recording system adapts to the electrode-tissue interface impedance. By comparing it with a point source approximated neuron, it is also shown that the neuron three-dimensional volume should be taken into account to simulate the extracellular action potential recording. Finally, the influence of the electrode size on the signal amplitude is evaluated. This parameter, together with the microelectrode noise, should be taken into account in order to optimize future microelectrode designs in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.903522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360072.pdf","startPage":"683","endPage":"692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.903522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New 3-D Finite-Element Model Based on Thin-Film Approximation for Microelectrode Array Recording of Extracellular Action Potential","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A New 3-D Finite-Element Model Based on Thin-Film Approximation for Microelectrode Array Recording of Extracellular Action Potential","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748187","pubMedId":"18270005","htmlLink":"/document/4360072/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New 3-D Finite-Element Model Based on Thin-Film Approximation for Microelectrode Array Recording of Extracellular Action Potential","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-moulin-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089307S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4360079,"authors":[{"name":"Janusz Jezewski","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Institute Medical Technology and Equipment, Zabrze, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Jezewski","id":"37327893800"},{"name":"Tomasz Kupka","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Institute Medical Technology and Equipment, Zabrze, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kupka","id":"37340176100"},{"name":"Krzysztof Horoba","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Informatics, Institute Medical Technology and Equipment, Zabrze, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Horoba","id":"37327147200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4360079","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Fetal heart rate","Ultrasonic imaging","Signal processing algorithms","Monitoring","Heart beat","Signal processing","Electrocardiography","Instruments","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","medical signal processing","obstetrics","signal representation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fetal heart-rate signal","time event series","Doppler ultrasound technique","data sampling","invasive fetal electrocardiography","heartbeat detection","FHR signal determination","autocorrelation techniques","cross-correlation techniques","signal representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler ultrasound","fetal heart-rate (FHR) variability","heartbeat events"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Cardiotocography","Echocardiography, Doppler","Heart Rate","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Ultrasonography, Prenatal"]},{"kwd":["Doppler ultrasound","fetal heart rate variability","heart beat events"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360079","abstract":"Analysis of variability of fetal heart rate (FHR) is very important in prediction of the fetal wellbeing. The beat-to-beat variability is described quantitatively by the indices originated from invasive fetal electrocardiography which provides the FHR signal in a form of time event series. Today, monitoring instrumentation is based on Doppler ultrasound technology. We used two bedside fetal monitors with different processing methods for heartbeat detection and FHR signal determination: the autocorrelation and cross-correlation techniques. Both monitors provide the output signal in a form of evenly spaced samples. The goal of this paper is to present a new method for the FHR signal processing, which enables extraction of series of consecutive heartbeat intervals from the sampled signal. The proposed correction algorithms allow recognition and removal of the FHR signal distortions typical for fetal monitors-invalid and duplicated samples. The correction efficiency has been verified based on the FHR variability indices calculated for the sampled signal and the corresponding event series. For both monitors, considerable influence of the signal representation on indices values was noted. Concluding, we recommended implementing these algorithms in fetal surveillance system as a preprocessing stage for the determination of FHR variability indices.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.903532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.903532","startPage":"805","endPage":"810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360079.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Fetal Heart-Rate Signal as the Time Event Series From Evenly Sampled Data Acquired Using Doppler Ultrasound Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Fetal Heart-Rate Signal as the Time Event Series From Evenly Sampled Data Acquired Using Doppler Ultrasound Technique","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4360079/","accessionNumber":"9748176","pubMedId":"18270022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360079/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Fetal Heart-Rate Signal as the Time Event Series From Evenly Sampled Data Acquired Using Doppler Ultrasound Technique","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-jezewski-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054341S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4360105,"authors":[{"name":"Shantanu Sarkar","affiliation":["Medtronic, Inc., Mounds View, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37830647400"},{"name":"David Ritscher","affiliation":["Cardiac Rhythm and Disease Management Research Division, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ritscher","id":"37841414200"},{"name":"Rahul Mehra","affiliation":["Cardiac Rhythm and Disease Management Research Division, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Mehra","id":"37308956300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4360105","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":139,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":1110},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Patient monitoring","Rhythm","Biomedical monitoring","Computerized monitoring","Atrial fibrillation","Electrocardiography","Medical treatment","Computer integrated manufacturing","Pacemakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","biomedical measurement","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chronic implantable atrial tachyarrhythmia monitor","continuous long-term monitoring","atrial fibrillation detection","tachycardia detection","therapeutic decisions","regular ventricular response","sinus rhythm","biomedical signal processing","Lorenz plot","ECG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atrial fibrillation","atrial tachycardia","biomedical signal processing","implantable atrial tachyarrhythmia monitor","Lorenz plot"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Atrial Fibrillation","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Electrocardiography, Ambulatory","Humans","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Prostheses and Implants","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Tachycardia, Ectopic Atrial"]},{"kwd":["Atrial fibrillation detection","Lorenz plot","implantable monitor","RR interval"]}],"abstract":"Continuous long-term monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) and tachycardia (AT) is an unmet clinical need, which could be met with a chronically-implanted monitor.

This paper describes an AF/AT detector that detects AF as well as AT with an irregular ventricular response, and a supplementary AT detector for AT with more regular ventricular response. Seven databases with significant durations of AF, AT, and sinus rhythm were used to evaluate the performance of the detectors. All patient records with AF (N = 124) were detected by the AF/AT detector to have AF/AT burden with a mean, median, and 75 percentile of absolute error in burden detection of 8.8, 0, and 4 min, respectively. In patients having AF burden (ges 10 min), the AF/AT detector was found to have burden accuracy within 20% of true burden in 96% of patients. The specificity was 94%, defined as follows: in patient records without AF/AT (N = 174), the percentage with AF/AT burden les10 min in the 24-h recordings. The AF/AT detector underestimates AT burden, thus degrading performance, in patients with significant amounts of AT with more regular ventricular response. The supplementary AT detector reduces the underestimation of AT while overestimating burden in patients without a significant amount of AT. The detectors described here could be implemented in an implantable monitor for accurate long-term AF/AT monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.903707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4454032/04360105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.903707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454032","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Detector for a Chronic Implantable Atrial Tachyarrhythmia Monitor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Detector for a Chronic Implantable Atrial Tachyarrhythmia Monitor","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9794331","pubMedId":"18334416","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Detector for a Chronic Implantable Atrial Tachyarrhythmia Monitor","sourcePdf":"55tbme03-sarkar-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049304S","chronDate":"March  2008","isNumber":"4454032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"139","articleId":"4360105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4360109,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhold Scherer","affiliation":["Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360109/4360109-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reinhold Scherer received the Dipl.Ing. degree in computer science from the Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 2001, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces (Institute of Knowledge Discovery).","Currently, he is Technical Manager at the Institute for Neurological Rehabilitation and Research, affiliated with the rehabilitation center Judendorf-Strassengel, Judendorf-Strassengel, Austria.

This is important to enhance the usability, flexibility, and response time of a BCI. In this work, we show how subjects, after performing cue-based feedback training (smiley paradigm), learned to navigate self-paced through the \u00bffreeSpace\u00bf virtual environment (VE). Similar to computer games, subjects had the task of picking up items by using the following navigation commands: rotate left, rotate right, and move forward ( three classes). Since the self-paced control paradigm allows subjects to make voluntary decisions on time, type, and duration of mental activity, no cues or routing directives were presented. The BCI was based only on three bipolar electroencephalogram channels and operated by motor imagery. Eye movements (electrooculogram) and electromyographic artifacts were reduced and detected online. The results of three able-bodied subjects are reported and problems emerging from self-paced control are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360109/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9748194","pubMedId":"18270004","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4360109/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toward Self-Paced Brain\u2013Computer Communication: Navigation Through Virtual Worlds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Self-Paced Brain\u2013Computer Communication: Navigation Through Virtual Worlds","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-scherer-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080446S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4360123,"authors":[{"name":"Frida Sandberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360123/4360123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frida Sandberg received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2003, the Licentiate degree in signal processing in 2007, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in signal processing at Lund University.","Her research interests are statistical signal processing and time\u2013frequency analysis with application to biomedical signals."]},"firstName":"Frida","lastName":"Sandberg","id":"37394129200"},{"name":"Martin Stridh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360123/4360123-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Stridh (S'97\u2013M'03) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 1997 and 2003, respectively.","Currently, he is Assistant Professor in the Signal Processing Group at Lund University.

Following QRST cancellation, a sequence of observed frequency states is obtained from the residual ECG, using the short-time Fourier transform. Based on the observed state sequence, the Viterbi algorithm retrieves the optimal state sequence by exploiting the state transition matrix, incorporating knowledge on AF characteristics, and the observation matrix, incorporating knowledge of the frequency estimation method and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The tracking method is evaluated with simulated AF signals to which noise, obtained from ECG recordings, has been added at different SNRs. The results show that the use of HMM improves performance considerably by reducing the rms error associated with frequency tracking: at 4-dB SNR, the rms error drops from 0.2 to 0.04 Hz.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Tracking of Atrial Fibrillation Using Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.905488","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360123.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.905488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Tracking of Atrial Fibrillation Using Hidden Markov Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4360123/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748193","pubMedId":"18269985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Tracking of Atrial Fibrillation Using Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-sandberg-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086668S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4360124,"authors":[{"name":"Samanwoy Ghosh-Dastidar","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360124/4360124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samanwoy Ghosh-Dastidar was born in New Delhi, India, in 1976.

The two-stage classifier is integrated with the mixed-band wavelet-chaos methodology, developed earlier by the authors, for accurate and robust classification of electroencephalogram (EEGs) into healthy, ictal, and interictal EEGs. A nine-parameter mixed-band feature space discovered in previous research for effective EEG representation is used as input to the two-stage classifier. In the first stage, PCA is employed for feature enhancement. The rearrangement of the input space along the principal components of the data improves the classification accuracy of the cosine radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) employed in the second stage significantly. The classification accuracy and robustness of the classifier are validated by extensive parametric and sensitivity analysis. The new wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology yields high EEG classification accuracy (96.6%) and is quite robust to changes in training data with a low standard deviation of 1.4%. For epilepsy diagnosis, when only normal and interictal EEGs are considered, the classification accuracy of the proposed model is 99.3%. This statistic is especially remarkable because even the most highly trained neurologists do not appear to be able to detect interictal EEGs more than 80% of the times.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.905490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360124.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.905490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","startPage":"512","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal Component Analysis-Enhanced Cosine Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Robust Epilepsy and Seizure Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Principal Component Analysis-Enhanced Cosine Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Robust Epilepsy and Seizure Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748170","pubMedId":"18269986","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4360124/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal Component Analysis-Enhanced Cosine Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Robust Epilepsy and Seizure Detection","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-ghoshdastidar-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063944S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"344","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4360130,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Popescu","affiliation":["Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology and the Hoglund Brain Imaging Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4454032/4360130/4360130-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mihai Popescu received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania, in 1994, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 1996 and 2001, respectively.","He worked as a Scientific Researcher in the MEG Laboratory, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama, Japan (2001\u20132003), focusing on studying the neural mechanisms of auditory processing.

The objectives of these studies require accurate spatio-temporal estimation of the underlying neural generators, a challenging task due to the relatively low signal strength and high correlation between bilateral auditory cortical sources. This paper evaluates the performance of two beamforming schemes that can potentially overcome such difficulties: 1) the linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer with partial sensor coverage (LCMV-PSC), and 2) the multiple constrained minimum-variance beamformer with coherent source region suppression (MCMV-CSRS). Simulation experiments are conducted to assess the impact of source parameters on the reconstruction accuracy. The results indicate that the LCMV-PSC method is prone to localization errors that essentially occur along medio-lateral directions, increase with source depth, and are associated to amplitude and phase distortions of the estimated time courses of activity. Comparatively, the MCMV-CSRS method exhibits precise localization and minimal amplitude and phase distortion for a broad range of relative interferer's positions within the suppression region. The results from the numerical experiments are validated on real magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data collected from a 40-Hz ASSR paradigm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.906504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454032","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1102","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4454032/04360130.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio\u2013Temporal Reconstruction of Bilateral Auditory Steady-State Responses Using MEG Beamformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4360130/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatio\u2013Temporal Reconstruction of Bilateral Auditory Steady-State Responses Using MEG Beamformers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9794327","pubMedId":"18334401","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio\u2013Temporal Reconstruction of Bilateral Auditory Steady-State Responses Using MEG Beamformers","sourcePdf":"55tbme03-popescu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094263S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4454032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4454032","articleId":"4360130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4360136,"authors":[{"name":"Angelika Dimoka","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Bourns School of Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4432718/4360136/4360136-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angelika Dimoka (S'01\u2013M'06) was born in Larissa, Greece.

The dentate gyrus is the first region of the hippocampus which receives and integrates sensory information via the perforant path. The perforant path is composed of two distinct pathways: (1) the lateral path and (2) the medial perforant path. The proposed approach examines and captures the short-term dynamic characteristics of these two pathways using a nonparametric, third-order Poisson-Volterra model. The nonlinear characteristics of the two pathways are represented by Poisson-Volterra kernels, which are quantitative descriptors of the nonlinear dynamic transformations. The kernels were computed with experimental data from \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vitro</i>\n hippocampal slices. The electrophysiological activity was measured with custom-made multielectrode arrays, which allowed selective stimulation with random impulse trains and simultaneous recordings of extracellular field potential activity. The results demonstrate that this mathematically rigorous approach is suitable for the multipathway complexity of the hippocampus and yields interpretable models that have excellent predictive capabilities. The resulting models not only accurately predict previously reported electrophysiological descriptors, such as paired pulses, but more important, can be used to predict the electrophysiological activity of dentate granule cells to arbitrary stimulation patterns at the perforant path.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["In vitro","Hippocampus","Biomedical engineering","Kernel","Electrophysiology","Predictive models","Brain modeling","Viterbi algorithm","Face","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical electrodes","brain","cellular biophysics","mean square error methods","neurophysiology","nonparametric statistics","stochastic processes","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hippocampal perforant path-dentate system","nonlinear dynamic transformation","dentate gyrus","sensory information integration","nonparametric model","third-order Poisson-Volterra model","electrophysiological activity","multielectrode array","selective stimulation","random impulse train","extracellular field potential activity","multipathway complexity","dentate granule cell","Laguerre expansion","synaptic transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dentate gyrus","electrophysiology","hippocampus","Laguerre expansion","multielectrode arrays","nonlinear modeling","perforant path","synaptic transmission","Volterra kernel"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Cerebellar Nuclei","Computer Simulation","Hippocampus","Microelectrodes","Models, Neurological","Nerve Net","Nonlinear Dynamics","Perforant Pathway"]},{"kwd":["Hippocampus, , , , , ,","Dentate Gyrus","Poisson-Volterra","Kernel","Laguerre Expansion","Multi Input","Multi Electrode"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.908075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4432718/04360136.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.908075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the Nonlinear Properties of the <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">in vitro</emphasis> Hippocampal Perforant Path-Dentate System Using Multielectrode Array Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4360136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Nonlinear Properties of the <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">in vitro</emphasis> Hippocampal Perforant Path-Dentate System Using Multielectrode Array Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360136/","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4360136/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9748162","pubMedId":"18270006","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Nonlinear Properties of the <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">in vitro</emphasis> Hippocampal Perforant Path-Dentate System Using Multielectrode Array Technology","sourcePdf":"55tbme02-dimoka-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4432718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4432718","articleId":"4360136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4360145,"authors":[{"name":"James J.

Furthermore, there is little radial signal decay within the channel, and a smooth axial variation of signal amplitude along the channel, irrespective of node location. Additional benefits include a greater extracellular voltage generated by large myelinated fibres compared to small unmyelinated axons, and the reduction of gain to unity at the end of the channel which ensures that there can be no crosstalk with electrodes in other channels nearby. A microchannel architecture seems well suited to the requirements of a peripheral nerve interface.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.909533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.909533","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4454032/04360145.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microchannels as Axonal Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Microchannels as Axonal Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4360145/","accessionNumber":"9794312","pubMedId":"18334406","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4360145/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microchannels as Axonal Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tbme03-fitzgerald.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082169S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4454032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4454032","articleId":"4360145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4360147,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Shenoy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Shenoy","id":"38559396000"},{"name":"Kai J.

Higher power efficiency and wider loading current range require rethinking the control method for DC-DC converters. Therefore, a highly efficient tri-mode DC-DC converter is invented in this paper for system-on-chip (SoC) applications, which is switched to sleeping mode at very light load condition or to high-speed mode at heavy load condition. The efficiency improvement is upgraded by inserting new proposed dithering skip modulation (DSM) between conventional pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM). In other words, an efficiency-improving DSM operation raises the efficiency drop because of transition from PWM to PFM. Importantly, DSM mode can dynamically skip the number of gate driving pulses, which is inverse proportional to load current. Simplistically and qualitatively stated, the novel load sensor automatically selects optimum modulation method and power MOSFET width to achieve high efficiency over a wide load range. Moreover, optimum power MOSFET turn-on and turn-off delays in synchronous rectifiers and reduced ground bounce can save much switching loss by current-mode dead-time controller. Experimental results show the tri-mode operation can have high efficiency about 90% over a wide load current range from 3 to 500 mA. Owing to the effective mitigation of the switching loss contributed by optimum power MOSFET width and reduction of conduction loss contributed by optimum dead-times, the novel width and dead-time controllers achieve high efficiency about 95% at heavy load condition and maintain the highly efficient performance to very light load current about 0.1 mA.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.907175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4362082/04362095.pdf","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.907175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dithering Skip Modulation, Width and Dead Time Controllers in Highly Efficient DC-DC Converters for System-On-Chip Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Dithering Skip Modulation, Width and Dead Time Controllers in Highly Efficient DC-DC Converters for System-On-Chip Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362095/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9671183","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362095/","volume":"42","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dithering Skip Modulation, Width and Dead Time Controllers in Highly Efficient DC-DC Converters for System-On-Chip Applications","sourcePdf":"42jssc11-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072211S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4362082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4362082","articleId":"4362095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4362096,"authors":[{"name":"Rafal Karakiewicz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4362082/4362096/4362096-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafal Karakiewicz (S'03) received the B.A.Sc. degree (with honors) and the M.A.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","Currently he is working as an Analog Design Engineer at Snowbush Microelectronics, focusing on high-speed serial data links."]},"firstName":"Rafal","lastName":"Karakiewicz","id":"37422049000"},{"name":"Roman Genov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4362082/4362096/4362096-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Roman Genov (S'96\u2013M'02) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, in 1996, and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He held engineering positions at Atmel Corporation, Columbia, MD, in 1995 and Xerox Corporation, Rochester, NY, in 1996.

Both the integral and proportional loop filter paths use sample and hold switched-capacitor networks that completely isolate the oscillator from the charge-pump switching transients. The sampled nature of the filter, together with a digital domain implementation of the ripple-filtering pole spread the impulsive energy coming from the charge-pump current injection over several reference clock cycles, resulting in a dramatic reduction of the oscillator control signal ripple and thus a very low reference spur level. A multi-regulator PLL architecture reduces the supply injected noise and spurious tones, allowing the integration of the synthesizer on the same die with a large digital core, as required by modern single-chip receiver SoCs. PLL specifications include: < 1deg rms double-sided integrated phase noise from 1 kHz to 10 MHz, -85 dBc reference spurs, < -80 dBc supply injected spurs, 300 times 750 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n die area and < 100 mW power dissipation from a single 2.5 V supply.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362103/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671191","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A low reference spurs 1-5 GHz 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS frequency synthesizer using a fully-sampled feed-forward loop filter architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A low reference spurs 1-5 GHz 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS frequency synthesizer using a fully-sampled feed-forward loop filter architecture","sourcePdf":"42jssc11-maxim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043433S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4362082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","xplore-issue":"4362082","articleId":"4362103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4362104,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Wook Min","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4362082/4362104/4362104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Wook Min (S'03) was born in Seoul, Korea.

The attenuation is controlled by 12 nMOS varistors, and the nMOS parasitics are absorbed in a synthetic transmission line to result in a wide bandwidth. The electrical distance between the varistors is explored to minimize the size of the distributed attenuator, and a method to balance the insertion phase is presented. At 33-37 GHz, the minimum attenuation state loss is 2.1 dB, and the maximum attenuation state loss is 13.0 dB. The attenuator has a maximum attenuation range of 11 dB with 0.9-dB steps (13 states). The rms phase imbalance is less than 3 at DC-50 GHz for all attenuation states. The attenuator does not consume any static power and the input 1-dB compression point is 5 dBm (defined as the 1-dB drop in the maximum attenuation range) at 20 GHz.

It has 100-MHz burst modes that are compatible with a pseudo-SRAM even though the toggle cell requires reading and comparing sequences in write modes. To accelerate operating clock frequency, we propose a distributed-driver wide-swing current-mirror scheme, an interleaved and pipelined memory-array group activation scheme, and a noise-insulation switch scheme. These circuit schemes compensate the toggle cell timing overhead in write modes and maintain write-current precision that is essential for the wide operational margin of MRAMs. Because toggle cells are very resistant to write disturbance errors, we designed the 16-Mb MRAM to include a toggle MRAM cell. The MRAM was fabricated with 0.13-mum CMOS and 0.24-mum MRAM processes with five metal layers.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.906195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4362082/04362112.pdf","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.906195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16-Mb Toggle MRAM With Burst Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A 16-Mb Toggle MRAM With Burst Modes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362112/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9671198","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362112/","volume":"42","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16-Mb Toggle MRAM With Burst Modes","sourcePdf":"42jssc11-sugibayashi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140059S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4362082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4362082","articleId":"4362112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4362114,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Wieckowski","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4362082/4362114/4362114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Wieckowski (S'99) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The AOFB-scheme is obtained from a detailed analysis of the dynamics of general output-ripple-based controller during reference tracking. Then, an adaptive feedback voltage which satisfies the switching criterion for optimum switch control in reference tracking is formulated, and is incorporated into the controller design. The resultant single ON/OFF-switching during reference tracking is very close to the optimal solution for fast reference tracking. Moreover, it also leads to the lowest switching loss and minimized conduction loss at the fastest tracking speed, making the converter very suitable for adaptive-output applications. Fabricated in a 0.35 mum CMOS process, the 3-V input prototype chip exhibits stable operation across a wide output range of 0.7-2.4 V. High tracking speed within 10 mus/V is measured with different output voltages and output voltage steps.

Such an adaptive system requires an accurate, reliable, and practically viable metric predictors to invoke the dynamic management actions in a timely and efficient manner. Unlike ad-hoc predictors proposed in the past, we propose a unified prediction method in which the optimal metric prediction problem is considered as that of minimizing an objective function. Choice of the objective function and the model type determines the form of the solution whether it is a closed form or one that is numerically determined through optimization. We formulate two particular realizations of the unified prediction method by using the total squared error and accumulated squared error as the objective functions in conjunction with autoregressive models. Under this scenario, the unified prediction method becomes linear prediction and the predictive least square (PLS) prediction, respectively. For both of these predictors, there is a analytical closed form solution that determines model parameters. Experimental results with prediction of instruction per cycle (IPC) and L1 cache miss rate metrics demonstrate superior performance for the proposed predictors over the last value predictor on SPECCPU 2000 benchmarks where in some cases the mean absolute prediction error is reduced by as much as 10-fold.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2007.4362178","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362166/4362167/04362178.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2007.4362178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Program Behavior Based On Objective Function Minimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Prediction methods","Predictive models","Power system management","Energy management","Temperature","Adaptive systems","Least squares methods","Closed-form solution","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","reverse engineering","software metrics","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["objective function minimization","computer system","optimal metric prediction problem","total squared error","accumulated squared error","autoregressive model","predictive least square prediction","instruction per cycle","program behavior prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Program Behavior Based On Objective Function Minimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9765768","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Program Behavior Based On Objective Function Minimization","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IISWC-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054051S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362166","isNumber":"4362167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362166","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4362167","articleId":"4362178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362188,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Alvarez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, HiPEAC European Network of Excellence, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Alvarez","id":"37425819600"},{"name":"Esther Salami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, HiPEAC European Network of Excellence, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Esther","lastName":"Salami","id":"37427273900"},{"name":"Alex Ramirez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, HiPEAC European Network of Excellence, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain","Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37275843200"},{"name":"Mateo Valero","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, HiPEAC European Network of Excellence, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain","Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain"],"firstName":"Mateo","lastName":"Valero","id":"37265842600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1561-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1562-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4362188","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HD-VideoBench.

The analysis of multiprogrammed workloads for multicore and SMT processors is challenging and time-consuming because there are many possible combinations of benchmarks to execute and each combination may exhibit several different interesting behaviors. Missing particular combinations of program behaviors could hide performance problems with designs. It is thus of utmost importance to have a representative multiprogrammed workload when evaluating multithreaded processor designs. This paper presents a methodology that uses phase analysis, principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) applied to microarchitecture-independent program characteristics in order to find important program interactions in multiprogrammed workloads. The end result is a small set of co-phases with associated weights that are representative for a multiprogrammed workload across multithreaded processor architectures. Applying our methodology to the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark suite yields 50 distinct combinations for two-context multithreaded processor simulation that6 researchers and architects can use for simulation. Each combination is simulated for 50 million instructions, giving a total of 2.5 billion instructions to be simulated for the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. The performance prediction error with these representative combinations is under 2.5% of the real workload for absolute throughput prediction and can be used to make relative throughput comparisons across processor architectures.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2007.4362195","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362166/4362167/04362195.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2007.4362195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representative Multiprogram Workloads for Multithreaded Processor Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Representative Multiprogram Workloads for Multithreaded Processor Simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362195/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representative Multiprogram Workloads for Multithreaded Processor Simulation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IISWC-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062049S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362166","isNumber":"4362167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362166","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4362167","articleId":"4362195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362248,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Arrayed MC-CDMA systems combine MC-CDMA and antenna array technology to harness the spatial and temporal 'signatures' of received signals, thus making it possible to realize high transmission rates envisioned for next generation wireless communications. Localized scattering, which occurs for each multipath, motivates the frequency selective wireless channel to be modelled as a diffused vector channel. In this paper, space-time diffused vector channels for arrayed MC-CDMA systems are modelled and analyzed. Simulation studies show that the use of this diffused channel modelling in arrayed MC-CDMA receivers yields better bit error rate (BER) performance than receivers that ignore the presence of spatial and/or temporal diffusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362278.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffused Multipath Vector Channels for Arrayed MC-CDMA Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Antenna arrays","Bit error rate","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Multiaccess communication","Robustness","Frequency conversion","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","error statistics","multipath channels","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal diffusion","bit error rate","space-time diffused vector channels","next generation wireless communications","temporal signatures","spatial signatures","antenna array technology","wireless channels","OFDM","multi-carrier code division multiple access","arrayed MC-CDMA communication systems","diffused multipath vector channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Diffused Multipath Vector Channels for Arrayed MC-CDMA Communication Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642476","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffused Multipath Vector Channels for Arrayed MC-CDMA Communication Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053148S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362279,"authors":[{"name":"Bayarpurev Mongol","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Bayarpurev","lastName":"Mongol","id":"37297008000"},{"name":"Takaya Yamazato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Yamazato","id":"37270510400"},{"name":"Hiraku Okada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiraku","lastName":"Okada","id":"37273515400"},{"name":"Masaaki Katayama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Katayama","id":"37276468500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362279","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Dispersion","Time-varying channels","Intersymbol interference","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Equations","Statistical analysis","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offset QAM","maximum-likelihood channel estimator","channel statistics","biorthogonal frequency division system","channel equalization","intercarrier interferences","intersymbol interferences","pulse-shaping OFDM","dispersive time-varying channels","BFDM/OQAM system"]}],"abstract":"Pulse-shaping OFDM is well-known that it performs well in a mobile environment comparing with conventional OFDM.

Practically, proper channel equalization and estimation are needed for further improvement of the systems. In this paper, more general case, namely biorthogonal frequency division system based on offset QAM (BFDM/OQAM) is considered. We first derive analytical equations for the channel statistics. Further, we propose maximum-likelihood channel estimator and its low-complexity versions. The performance analysis shows that the estimators are robust against Doppler spread of the channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for BFDM/OQAM System in Dispersive Time-Varying Channels","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362279","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362279.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for BFDM/OQAM System in Dispersive Time-Varying Channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362279/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for BFDM/OQAM System in Dispersive Time-Varying Channels","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05186S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362286,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Krondorf","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Krondorf","id":"37828291700"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362286","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Channel estimation","Mobile communication","Frequency estimation","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput enhancement","MIMO OFDM","frequency domain channel length indicator guard interval adaptation","channel impulse response","SISO","spectrum mask","changing propagation environments"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a novel scheme for OFDM guard interval adaptation is presented, that uses the frequency domain channel length indicator (FCLI) algorithm for estimating the length of the channel impulse response (CIR).

Spatial division multiple access (SDMA, or called multi-user MIMO) is a potential solution to achieve high system throughput among various MIMO approaches. However, rank deficiency of the varying wireless channel degrades the throughput performance of SDMA. Moreover, when the number of users with non-empty traffic buffers in a sector is small, multi-user MIMO suffers performance loss caused by receiver difference: linear receiver vs. successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver. Multi-user MIMO solution is difficult to support SIC receivers due to the causal/sequential decoding, whereas single user MIMO could easily extended to SIC receiver case. In this paper, we propose a preceded multi-user MIMO transmission scheme with rank selection and single user/multi-user MIMO mode switch, which is called multi-mode per-user unitary rate control (multi-mode PU\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nRC). Feedback from each mobile station to base station is quantified and the limited feedback rate is always preferred at the expense of minimum performance degradation. Simulation results reveal that our proposed scheme outperforms multi-mode single-user schemes, single-mode multi-user MIMO schemes and single user MIMO schemes with SIC receivers altogether in terms of the achievable throughput bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362291.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Mode Multi-User MIMO System with Finite Rate Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Silicon carbide","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Degradation","Switches","Wireless communication","Performance loss","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio links","receivers","sequential codes","space division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","wireless communications link","spatial division multiple access","rank deficiency","wireless channels","traffic buffers","linear receiver","successive interference cancellation","sequential decoding","rank selection","multi-mode per-user unitary rate control","mobile station","base station","finite rate feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Mode Multi-User MIMO System with Finite Rate Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9689059","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Mode Multi-User MIMO System with Finite Rate Feedback","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045126S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4362298,"authors":[{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electroscience, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Buon Kiong","lastName":"Lau","id":"37285007500"},{"name":"Jorgen Bach Andersen","affiliation":["Department of Communications Technology, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jorgen Bach","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37280846000"},{"name":"Andreas F.

However, some important applications, including mobile communications, require compact implementations. One important challenge in miniaturizing MIMO systems for compact terminals is to overcome capacity performance degradation resulting from mutual coupling among closely separated antennas. In this contribution, we begin with a review of the state-of-the-art, with particular emphasis on impedance matching and its impact on capacity. Whereas it has been shown that a multiport extension of the conjugate match is optimum in a reference environment with uniform 3D angular power spectrum, its bandwidth is severely reduced by decreasing antenna separation. On the other hand, noncoupled, individual port matching is inherently simpler to implement and broader in bandwidth, but offers a smaller capacity. Here, we demonstrate that mean capacity can be easily maximized with respect to individual port matching in a given random field. The extent of capacity gains provided by the optimized matching network over existing individual port matching networks strongly depends on the propagation environment.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362298","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","startPage":"253","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Matching for Capacity Maximization in Compact MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Matching for Capacity Maximization in Compact MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642489","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Matching for Capacity Maximization in Compact MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061339S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362299,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus Doppler","affiliation":["Radio Technologies Laboratory, Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Doppler","id":"37399272500"},{"name":"Ari Hottinen","affiliation":["Radio Technologies Laboratory, Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Ari","lastName":"Hottinen","id":"37269045500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362299","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Decoding","Protocols","MIMO","Downlink","Metropolitan area networks","Base stations","Testing","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","protocols","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink","cyclic prefix relays","metropolitan area network","spatial multiplexing","decode-and-forward relaying protocol","effective channel matrix","eigenvalue ratio","multistream MIMO communication","OFDM systems","multiantenna relay nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Relay networks","Amplify and Forward within the Cyclic Prefix","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study different ways of embedding multi-antenna relay nodes to OFDM systems.

Thus, decode and forward relays offer better spatial multiplexing possibilities. In particular we test the performance of the different relaying protocols for a 4times4times4 relay network in the downlink of a metropolitan area network. We show that amplify and forward within the cyclic prefix outperforms half-duplex amplify and forward and decode and forward relaying for a SNR up to 20 dB. Only at higher SNR decode and forward performs better due to its higher spatial multiplexing possibilities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Antenna Relay Nodes in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362299","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362299.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362299/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Antenna Relay Nodes in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362299/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642490","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Antenna Relay Nodes in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078418S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362300,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Theofilakos","affiliation":["Department Technology Education and Digital Systems, University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Theofilakos","id":"37658583700"},{"name":"Athanasios G.

In this paper, we remove the restriction that each antenna element must participate in only one subarray and study the capacity performance when a given number of phase shifters and variable gain amplifiers are available at the receiver. To further reduce the hardware complexity, we introduce a version that discards the variable gain amplifiers. A fast and efficient algorithm for ASF is used, which offers remarkably high data rates while maintaining low hardware and computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362300/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642491","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Hardware Complexity Receive Antenna Subarray Formation for MIMO Systems Based on Frobenius Norm Criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Hardware Complexity Receive Antenna Subarray Formation for MIMO Systems Based on Frobenius Norm Criterion","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071153S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4362302,"authors":[{"name":"Shinsuke Hara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Sumiyoshi, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Hara","id":"37276524200"},{"name":"Quoc Tuan Tran","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Quoc Tuan","lastName":"Tran","id":"37301805400"},{"name":"Atsushi Honda","affiliation":["Mobile Phones Group, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Honda","id":"37284320100"},{"name":"Yuuta Nakaya","affiliation":["Mobile Phones Group, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuta","lastName":"Nakaya","id":"37268127000"},{"name":"Ichirou Ida","affiliation":["Mobile Phones Group, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichirou","lastName":"Ida","id":"37297376300"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Oishi","affiliation":["Mobile Phones Group, Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Oishi","id":"37276013400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362302","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Diversity methods","Bit error rate","Costs","Energy consumption","Hardware","Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems","Switches","Computer simulation","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microswitches","MIMO communication","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency 5 GHz","frequency band","channel data","radiofrequency","microelectromechanical system","RF-MEMS switch","hardware complexity","computational complexity","receive antenna element","diversity gain","bit error rate","BER performance","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple input multiple output system","MIMO-OFDM transmission system","receive antenna selection diverrsity","receive antenna directivity diversity"]}],"abstract":"Receive antenna selection diverrsity in MIMO-OFDM transmission is attractive because it can achieve better BER performance due to higher diversity gain obtained, keeping the cost and energy consumption low.

To sustain sufficient CQI reporting accuracy and high FDPS gain, we show that time- domain CQI averaging over multiple sub-frames is desirable although it lowers the mobility performance. Conducting the averaging on the UE side is most attractive from a signalling perspective.

The analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provide a fair, effective and fast adaptive solution for distributed wireless medium access.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9642499","htmlLink":"/document/4362311/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Synchronised Dynamic p-Persistent MAC Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronised Dynamic p-Persistent MAC Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048546S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362317,"authors":[{"name":"Romeo Giuliano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Romeo","lastName":"Giuliano","id":"37266364600"},{"name":"Pierpaolo Loreti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierpaolo","lastName":"Loreti","id":"37273415500"},{"name":"Franco Mazzenga","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Mazzenga","id":"37273229500"},{"name":"Cristiano Monti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiano","lastName":"Monti","id":"37266471800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362317","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","WiMAX","Intersymbol interference","Interchannel interference","Genetic expression","Base stations","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Performance analysis","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network planning","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point-to-multipoint OFDMA-based network","broadband wireless interface","WiMax","frequency reuse","cellular system"]}],"abstract":"The 4-th generation broadband wireless interfaces for radio access will be based on OFDMA/OFDM multiple access/multiplexing techniques.

To exploit tx diversity and tx antenna array gain one tx antenna weight-set is ideally fed back per OFDMA subcarrier. Usually the uplink bandwidth limits the amount of permissible feedback. Thus feedback compression techniques are essential, three of which are explored in this paper within the framework of 3GPP UTRA long term evolution. The tx antenna weight- sets are chosen from Grassmannian code books for 2times2 and 4times2 antenna configurations. Combining subcarriers in subgroups, and feeding back only one antenna weigh set per subgroup is shown to be a simple and effective technique. It reduces the feedback load by up to 96% for a typical urban channel profile, while maintaining the system performance within 3% from the optimum. Methods on the basis of run-length encoding are also shown to decrease the fed back load significantly, however, when forced to reduce the feedback to the same level as with subgroup encoding, their performance turns out to be inferior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tackling MIMO-OFDMA Feedback Load Through Feedback Encoding","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362320","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362320.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Tackling MIMO-OFDMA Feedback Load Through Feedback Encoding","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362320/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tackling MIMO-OFDMA Feedback Load Through Feedback Encoding","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082618S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362321,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Kimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryota","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37269075500"},{"name":"Shigeru Shimamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Shimamoto","id":"37281343200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362321","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","OFDM","Downlink","Bit error rate","Degradation","Wireless communication","Computer simulation","Narrowband","Intersymbol interference","Multicarrier code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio links","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication","downlink channels","uplink channels","multicarrier transmission technique","OFDD","orthogonal frequency division duplex","wireless duplex"]}],"abstract":"One of the advantages of multi-carrier transmission techniques is the flexibility of frequency resource usage.

Terminals transmit their own signals simultaneously, and thus OFDD realizes full-duplex wireless systems. In this paper, we introduce the principle of OFDD and compare the features of OFDD and the other conventional duplex schemes.

However, interference from the hotspots deteriorates the communication performance of original cellular system. In this paper, in order to decrease these interference, we set up the access point of hotspots with the adaptive array antenna and code assignment method between the cellular and the hotspot communication are considered. OFDM hotspot communication is overlapped to the uplink of MC/DS-CDMA cellular system in the same frequency band and we propose the beam forming method to eliminate inter-system interference. Moreover, by allocating orthogonal variable spreading factors (OVSF) code to the both hotspot users and cellular users in the hotspot uplink period, the orthogonality of each user is kept. As a result, we can embed many hotspots into the cellular system with very small interference toward the uplink communication of cellular and we can improve the capacity of the system. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by computer simulation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362322.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Sharing Hotspot Communication using OFDM Adaptive Array Antenna under Uplink Multi-Carrier CDMA Cellular System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","OFDM","Antenna arrays","Multiaccess communication","Interference elimination","Femtocell networks","Computer simulation","AWGN","Rayleigh channels","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","AWGN","cellular radio","code division multiple access","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","radio links","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency sharing hotspot communication","OFDM adaptive array antenna","uplink multicarrier CDMA cellular system","code assignment method","beam forming method","orthogonal variable spreading factor code","interference","additive white Gaussian noise","Rayleigh fading environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-carrier CDMA","hotspots","adaptive array antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Sharing Hotspot Communication using OFDM Adaptive Array Antenna under Uplink Multi-Carrier CDMA Cellular System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362322/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642509","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Sharing Hotspot Communication using OFDM Adaptive Array Antenna under Uplink Multi-Carrier CDMA Cellular System","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052179S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362323,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Demarez","affiliation":["ISEN Lille, Department, SST, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Demarez","id":"37947660800"},{"name":"David Boulinguez","affiliation":["ISEN Lille, Department, SST, Lille, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Boulinguez","id":"37327121600"},{"name":"Yves Delignon","affiliation":["GET INT ENIC Telecom Lille 1, IEMN CNRS UMR 8520, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Delignon","id":"37294489900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362323","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Multicast algorithms","Error analysis","Channel state information","Unicast","OFDM modulation","Telecommunications","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bit","adaptive power-loading","multicast OFDM transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","Rayleigh fading channel","adaptive modulation","wireless multicarrier system","multicast transmission","wireless multicast system","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive modulation techniques (bit/power- loading) allow great optimisation of spectral efficiency, power consumption and error rates in wireless multicarrier systems.

After deriving an upper bound for the error rate in these conditions, we study the performance degradation occurring with imperfect channel state information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bit And Power-Loading For Multicast OFDM Transmissions In Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362323","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362323.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bit And Power-Loading For Multicast OFDM Transmissions In Rayleigh Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362323/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642510","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bit And Power-Loading For Multicast OFDM Transmissions In Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057542S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4362324,"authors":[{"name":"Teruo Kawamura","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruo","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37273158400"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37299879400"},{"name":"Kenichi Higuchi","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37269866000"},{"name":"Mamoru Sawahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Musashi Institute of Technology, Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Sawahashi","id":"37269819300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362324","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Throughput","Filters","Radio access networks","Frequency conversion","Modulation coding","Interference","Radio frequency","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","filtering theory","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repetition factor","repetition coding","multiuser interference","16QAM modulation","cubic metric","spectrum shaping filter","UTRA uplink","UMTS terrestrial radio access","SC-FDMA radio access","single-carrier frequency division multiple access","DFT-spread OFDM","roll-off factor"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the optimum roll-off factor value of the spectrum shaping filter in DFT-Spread OFDM based single- carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) using the criterion of the maximum achievable throughput considering a cubic metric (CM) in the Evolved UTRA uplink.

The new technique exploits transmit diversity, path diversity as well as coding gain through turbo iterations over the decoder branches in the receiver, and it is referred to as coded space-time single carrier transmission with soft cancellation minimum mean squared error filtering (CST Coded SC-MMSE) based equalization. The proposed system has two different iteration loops: horizontal and vertical, by which the path diversity gain and coding gain are achieved, respectively. The number of horizontal and vertical iterations can be determined using a scheduling technique, which is introduced in this paper as well. Performance of the CST SC-MMSE equalizer is evaluated in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) and frame-error-rate (FER).

Indeed, these measurements showed than it is possible to maintain a low distance between antenna elements for a fix correlation if the transmitting offset is increased.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362350","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","startPage":"510","endPage":"511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Measurements in a Small Tunnel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Measurements in a Small Tunnel","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362350/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9695828","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362350/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Measurements in a Small Tunnel","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03256S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362354,"authors":[{"name":"Virginia Corvino","affiliation":["CNIT - University of Bologna, Bologna, ITALY"],"firstName":"Virginia","lastName":"Corvino","id":"37568572500"},{"name":"Guenther Liebl","affiliation":["Inst. f.

In particular, a channel- and application- aware scheduling strategy is proposed and compared to a traditional maximum throughput algorithm. In our approach, fluctuations in the channel conditions of different users can be exploited via statistical multiplexing, while application-specific constraints (eg, on the delay of the relevant service) are also considered in the scheduling decision. Furthermore, we apply buffer management at the radio link layer to drop (possibly) outdated packets that are of less importance to the achievable quality. We will show that with clever choice of the parameters of our advanced algorithm we can support a larger number of satisfied video users at the expense of an increased average transmission delay for data users.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362354","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362354.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of Mixed Traffic over MC-CDMA under Varying Load and Channel Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362354/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of Mixed Traffic over MC-CDMA under Varying Load and Channel Conditions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642396","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362354/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of Mixed Traffic over MC-CDMA under Varying Load and Channel Conditions","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060922S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362356,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Fraile","affiliation":["University of Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Fraile","id":"37298853400"},{"name":"Jose Monserrat","affiliation":["University of Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Monserrat","id":"37294148100"},{"name":"Narcis Cardona","affiliation":["University of Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Narcis","lastName":"Cardona","id":"38265022400"},{"name":"Jad Nasreddine","affiliation":["University of Politecnica de Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jad","lastName":"Nasreddine","id":"37269319600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362356","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","Autocorrelation","Analytical models","Probability density function","Signal processing","Interference","Power system modeling","Wireless networks","Radio link","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","correlation methods","probability","time division multiple access","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TD-CDMA","system-level simulations","shadowing simulation models","system capacity","cross-correlation","spatial autocorrelation","cross-link correlation","time-duplexing scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a comparative analysis of system-level TD-CDMA simulation results obtained for different shadowing simulation models.

Hence, interference profiles are subject to high increases that can highly affect interference limited systems. The allocation of several frequencies to each operator in 3G systems presents new dimensions to reduce interference patterns by the use of intelligent frequency management methodologies. However, the frequency management problem has not been sufficiently studied for WCDMA systems due to the fact that WCDMA has not yet been implemented in wide range with all possible services. Nevertheless, the arrival of multimedia services will emphasize the critical importance of a smart frequency allocation. Herein, we introduce a novel frequency management methodology based on statistical coupling matrices that reflect the interaction between cells for a given interference pattern. The proposed methodology is implemented as an integral task of the planning tool and has lead to better results than the frequency allocation in the classical hierarchical cell structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Frequency Management Methodology for WCDMA using Statistical Coupling Matrices","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362357","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362357.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Frequency Management Methodology for WCDMA using Statistical Coupling Matrices","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362357/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9682661","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Frequency Management Methodology for WCDMA using Statistical Coupling Matrices","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038764S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362361,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["Mobile Computing and Networking Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li","id":"37066957300"},{"name":"Jean Conan","affiliation":["Mobile Computing and Networking Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Conan","id":"37268191500"},{"name":"Samuel Pierre","affiliation":["Mobile Computing and Networking Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Pierre","id":"37273227000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362361","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Parameter estimation","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Redundancy","Signal processing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile positioning systems","Cramer-Rao lower bound","mean-square errors","algebraic location equations","optimal estimation","multipath parameters estimation","multipath signal parameters","advanced array signal processing","multipath signals","antenna array","direction finding and ranging","wireless location","MIMO communication systems","mobile station location estimation"]}],"abstract":"Wireless location is the procedure that determines the position of the mobile station in a wireless network. The traditional mobile location systems such as direction finding and ranging are based on trilateration/multilateration techniques. In wireless MIMO communication systems which utilize antenna array at both transmit and receive sides, the redundancy of multipath signals can be exploited to extract more parameters such as angle-of-arrival, angle-of-departure and delay-of-arrival using advanced array signal processing techniques. In this paper, based on estimated multipath signal parameters in the context of MIMO communication systems, we propose a novel approach to determine the position of mobile stations using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">only one base station</i>\n. This approach minimizes the errors occurring from the estimation of multipath parameters and gives an optimal estimation of the position of the mobile station by simultaneously resolving a set of algebraic location equations. The mean-square errors are measured and compared with the Cramer-Rao lower bound to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. This solution breaks the bottleneck of conventional mobile positioning systems which have to require multi-lateration of at least three BSs.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362361","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","startPage":"561","endPage":"564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Station Location Estimation for MIMO Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Station Location Estimation for MIMO Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362361/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642398","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362361/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Station Location Estimation for MIMO Communication Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042828S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362366,"authors":[{"name":"Taha Landolsi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Taha","lastName":"Landolsi","id":"37395271500"},{"name":"Marawan Abu-Amara","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Marawan","lastName":"Abu-Amara","id":"38274404100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362366","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Road transportation","Traffic control","Channel capacity","Degradation","Radio frequency","Petroleum","Minerals","Telecommunication traffic","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","mobile radio","queueing theory","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access channel performance","idle-mode ping-pong effect","inter-MSC handoffs","access channel capacity","access failure rate","CDMA wireless systems","queuing behavior","degraded network performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA Access Channel Capacity","Idle-Mode Ping-Pong Effect","Radio Resource Management"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of ping-pong effect at the inter-MSC border on the access channel capacity and access failure rate of CDMA wireless systems.

Under a LoS scenario, the channel is normally rank deficient due to the linear dependence of the LoS rays' phases on the receive elements. To overcome this problem, specifically designed antenna arrays can be employed, where the antenna elements are positioned to preserve the orthogonality of the LoS signal at the receiver; hence maximising the channel rank. A previously derived maximum capacity criterion is employed in the design of the proposed LoS-optimised MIMO system. The performance of this system is then assessed by means of a ray-tracing simulation and compared with that of a conventional MIMO system. It is shown that the proposed system exhibits a significant capacity enhancement (up to 41.8 %) near the deployment area. Moreover, the capacity was found to be higher than that predicted by the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading model due to the non-fading nature of the LoS signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Investigation of a Line-of-Sight Optimised 2\u00d72 MIMO System","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362372","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362372.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance Investigation of a Line-of-Sight Optimised 2\u00d72 MIMO System","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362372/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642403","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Investigation of a Line-of-Sight Optimised 2\u00d72 MIMO System","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051486S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362378,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Angel Rivas Cantero","affiliation":["Dpto. de Teor\u00eda de la Seal y Comunicaciones, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Angel Rivas","lastName":"Cantero","id":"37086674342"},{"name":"M.

This standard just proposes a typical SISO system, and leaves as optional the development of a multiple input - single output (MISO) 2 times 1 scheme employing Alamouti space-time codification (STC). Apart from comparing both systems in terms of data transfer rate and bit error rate (BER), the inclusion of a second antenna in the receiver is studied. Following exactly the preamble structure provided for fixed broadband wireless OFDM access (IEEE 802.16d), several scenarios are studied: single input - single output (SISO) systems, MISO systems, (both applying and not applying STC) and MIMO systems (both applying and not applying STC). Therefore this study can be considered as an extension to the wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN) standard, known as Wimax, which just proposes two of these five scenarios. In all of these communication schemes two algorithms are compared to obtain an accurate channel estimation. The first one is a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator in the frequency domain (Fernandez-Getino Garcia, 2004) and the second one is a least squares (LS) estimator in the time domain (Balamurali, 2004). Both of them are studied in terms of mean squared error (MSE) of the estimation and BER at the receiver. Moreover, algorithms for frequency offset estimation are also developed and analyzed both for SISO and MIMO systems based on IEEE 802.16d standard.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362378.pdf","endPage":"639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation and Frequency Synchronization for a Multi-Antenna Wimax System","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362378","startPage":"635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation and Frequency Synchronization for a Multi-Antenna Wimax System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362378/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9678218","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4362378/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation and Frequency Synchronization for a Multi-Antenna Wimax System","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049976S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362379,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Recently, 3GPP launched multi-carrier based beyond 3G study item (i.e., long-term evolution or LTE) to compete with other solutions such as IEEE 802.16e/20. In LTE or other compatible systems, feedback overhead is a key factor for throughput enhancement. The choice between single- user and multi-user MIMO is equivalently aligned with the problem of feedback burden, while throughput maximization is still of major concern in both scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the throughput performances of those two MIMO modes based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) framework in LTE. Simulation results show that multi-user MIMO scheme is more favorable than single-user MIMO in terms of receiver complexity and throughput gain, assuming that feedback overhead is almost equally allowed (i.e., additional 1-bit feedback is required for preceding in multi-user MIMO).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Limited Feedback Single-/Multi-User MIMO in 3GPP LTE Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362388","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362388.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Limited Feedback Single-/Multi-User MIMO in 3GPP LTE Systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362388/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9682666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Limited Feedback Single-/Multi-User MIMO in 3GPP LTE Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046298S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4362399,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Lei","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT),New Generation Wireless Research Center at Yokosuka, UMCG, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37268374500"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT),New Generation Wireless Research Center at Yokosuka, UMCG, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362399","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","OFDM","MIMO","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms","Bit error rate","Communications technology","Electronic mail","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GSO","Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization","broadband radio channels","frequency-selective fading","spectral efficient transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time","V-BLAST coded MIMO-OFDM","low-complexity detection schemes"]}],"abstract":"The combination of vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising solution for realizing spectral efficient transmission in scattered environments and overcoming the frequency-selective fading in broadband radio channels.

In addressing the complexity issue, two low-complexity detection schemes [8][9] are proposed. Both of them are based on the subcarrier grouping and apply the same detection order to the whole group.

In this paper, performance of the CST SC-MMSE equalizer is evaluated in realistic scenarios using multi-dimensional channel measurement data. Measurement data consists of snapshots measured in different channel conditions in terms of spatial and temporal properties. It is shown that the CST SC-MMSE equalizer can achieve excellent performance even at the lower SNR range due to the vertical iterations between the decoders that can achieve a coding gain on top of the diversity gain. However, performance depends on channel conditions. The impact of the horizontal and vertical iterations is studied in different channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362402","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362402.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Measurement Data Based Performance Evaluation of Coded Space-Time SC-MMSE MIMO Turbo Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362402/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Measurement Data Based Performance Evaluation of Coded Space-Time SC-MMSE MIMO Turbo Equalization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642420","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362402/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Measurement Data Based Performance Evaluation of Coded Space-Time SC-MMSE MIMO Turbo Equalization","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05823S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362406,"authors":[{"name":"Fabienne Nouvel","affiliation":["IETR/INSA, Institue Electronique Telecommunications de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Fabienne","lastName":"Nouvel","id":"37265979300"},{"name":"Arnaud Massiani","affiliation":["IETR/INSA, Institue Electronique Telecommunications de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Massiani","id":"37426424300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362406","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM modulation","Channel estimation","Downlink","Land mobile radio","Radio frequency","Software radio","Frequency synchronization","Modems","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","modems","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC CDMA","reconfigurable demonstrator","3G mobile radio system","RF interface","modem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component: MC-CDMA","4G","Co-Design","Implementation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the architecture and the design of a reconfigurable demonstrator for a downlink multicarrier-CDMA (MC-CDMA) based beyond 3G mobile radio system will be presented.

In this work we present a simple and easily reconfigurable 2 times 2 MIMO testbed for the rapid prototyping of the signal processing baseband functions. The signal generation module consists of a host PC equipped with a board that contains two high performance 100 MHz DACs and a 1 GB memory module that allows the transmission of extremely large frames of data. At the receiver side, we use another host PC equipped with two 105 MHz ADCs, another 1 GB memory module and a trigger that starts the acquisition process when the presence of signal is detected. The platform has been designed to operate at the ISM band of 2.4 GHz with a RF bandwidth of 20 MHz. In order to minimize the number of DAC and ADC circuits, signals are generated and acquired at an IF of 15 MHz. Upconversion to RF is performed with two RF vectorial signal generators (Agilent E4438C) and downconversion with two specific circuits designed from commercial components. Transmitter and receiver signal processing functions are implemented off-line in Matlab. To illustrate the performance and capabilities of the platform, we present the results of two experiments of a 2 times 2 MIMO transmission with Alamouti coding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362407","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362407.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"780","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Testbed for the Rapid Prototyping of MIMO Baseband Modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Testbed for the Rapid Prototyping of MIMO Baseband Modules","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4362407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9689051","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Testbed for the Rapid Prototyping of MIMO Baseband Modules","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050048S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4362411,"authors":[{"name":"Enis Kocan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Enis","lastName":"Kocan","id":"37562353400"},{"name":"Milica Pejanovic-Djurisic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Pejanovic-Djurisic","id":"37370203200"},{"name":"Maja Ilic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Ilic","id":"38631916600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362411","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Frequency synchronization","Frequency domain analysis","Bit error rate","Frequency diversity","Transmitters","Frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","Wireless LAN","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective channel","frequency offset","bit error rate","diversity reception","frequency synchronization","selection combining diversity","OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","diversity","frequency synchronization"]}],"abstract":"A frequency synchronization method for the specific OFDM receive diversity system, with implemented frequency domain subcarrier selection combining (SC), is proposed.

Complexity and latency are two important criteria in implementation of such iterative systems, even if receivers based on MMSE equalization are recognized to have a reasonable complexity. In classical sequencing of iterative receiver, equalization and channel decoding are iteratively and independently performed leading to peaks of calculation. In this paper, we propose to perform in parallel MIMO decoding and channel decoding by updating interference cancellation after each newly decoded bit. Thus, operations within the proposed receiver are uniformly distributed on iteration duration. Moreover, new information obtained owing to each decoding bit is used in the same decoding iteration to accelerate the process convergence. By this way, calculation power is evenly distributed on the iteration duration and number of iterations is reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362413","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362413.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Iterative Receiver with Bit Per Bit Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362413/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Iterative Receiver with Bit Per Bit Interference Cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642426","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362413/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Iterative Receiver with Bit Per Bit Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057138S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362414,"authors":[{"name":"Victor P.

As a conclusion of the work it can be confirmed that it is possible to implement an adaptive MIMO-OFDM system for cellular systems where the feed-back data rate is considerably compressed and therefore the efficiency is not compromised.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362414.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"813","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive MIMO - OFDM System: Design and Performance Evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Adaptive systems","Antenna theory","Adaptive arrays","OFDM modulation","Mobile communication","Radio transmitters","Channel estimation","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","feedback","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO-OFDM system","feedback information schemes","cellular systems","data compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive MIMO - OFDM System: Design and Performance Evaluation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9642427","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive MIMO - OFDM System: Design and Performance Evaluation","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050367S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4362415,"authors":[{"name":"Evan Mella","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Evan","lastName":"Mella","id":"37947606500"},{"name":"Ian Wassell","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Wassell","id":"37269368800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0397-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0398-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4362415","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Stochastic processes","Frequency","Delay","Error analysis","Lattices","Design methodology","Noise generators","Convergence","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM systems","symbol error rate","SER","lattice aided space frequency codes","LASF","stochastic methods","noisy empirical measurements","frequency selective channels"]}],"abstract":"High rate MIMO-OFDM systems can be adapted to improve symbol error rate (SER) by employing effective lattice aided space frequency (LASF) codes. Such high rate systems boasts high parametric dimensions to an extent that analytical formulation becomes restrictive, and in most cases impossible. The design of LASF codes have recently been studied under gradient-based stochastic methods. In this paper a low latency and low complexity novel stochastic method to design LASF codes is proposed. This is achieved by simultaneously perturbing the LASF generator matrix G and, from the noisy empirical measurements of the objective function, estimating the gradient. Algorithm convergence, in terms of the number of iterations, is faster than any other known stochastic methods. In fact, it is five times faster than the gradient based schemes. Comparing with an average randomly generated LASF matrix G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n, it is demonstrated that in quasi-static frequency selective channels the SER is observed to halve at a SNR of 30 dB. While having significantly lower computational complexity, simulations confirm that the novel stochastic method achieves improved SER performance across the entire SNR range. Furthermore, latency is significantly reduced since each computation requires a single pair of noisy measurements of the SER per iteration irrespective of the dimension of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362415","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362242/4362243/04362415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2006.4362415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362243","startPage":"814","endPage":"816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Stochastic LASF codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Stochastic LASF codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362415/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9678226","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Stochastic LASF codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISWCS-00-172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033291S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4362242","isNumber":"4362243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362242","xplore-issue":"4362243","articleId":"4362415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362471,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Cheng","affiliation":["Lane Department of CSEE, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37419808800"},{"name":"Matthew C.

Our approach is to combine subcarrier and power allocation by optimizing a user's power allocation immediately after the user has been allocated a subcarrier. Simulation results show that joint subcarrier and power allocation yields a significant performance improvement compared to other existing schemes which perform subcarrier allocation with a fixed (uniform) power allocation assumption. Joint subcarrier and power allocation is also extended to band-wise allocation of subcarriers in order to help reduce signaling overhead in time varying channels. We examine the trade-off between increasing the sub-band size and the corresponding degradation in system performance for different values of the channel multipath delay spread.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362483.pdf","startPage":"3208","endPage":"3213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06030103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06030103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Scheduling for Multiuser OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Delay","Job shop scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","System performance","Traffic control","Quality of service","Throughput","Downlink","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network management","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time varying channel","power allocation","subcarrier allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiuser OFDM","channel-aware queue-aware scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Scheduling for Multiuser OFDM","volume":"6","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4362483/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628220","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation in Channel-Aware Queue-Aware Scheduling for Multiuser OFDM","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046527S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362486,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Ling","affiliation":["Lucent Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362486/4362486-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Ling received the B.Sc degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ in 1992, and the M.Sc. in computer science from Stevens Institute, Hoboken, NJ in 1999, where he is currently working toward a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.

Various chip waveform shaping schemes are considered, including both one-chip long full-response pulses, and partial-response ones occupying several chip periods. Different figures of merits are considered in a comparative analysis that seeks to establish performance limits in terms of correct timing detection capability, false alarm rate, bandwidth occupancy, multiple-access interference (MAI), and inter-chip interference (ICI). A waveform design algorithm is formulated to optimize system performance in terms of signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) subject to other signalling constraints, and a solution based on the use of prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) is derived. Numerous waveform design examples are then constructed to illustrate acquisition detection capability versus system load for both faded and unfaded cases. A comparative assessment of the performance of conventional signalling waveforms against the optimized ones is also presented. In particular, the numerical results show that the half-sine pulse used in minimum shift keying (MSK) is quasi-optimal within the full-response category, while root-raised cosine (RRC) Nyquist filtering with 22% rolloff (used in third generation CDMA standards) is also close to optimal when considering many-chip-long pulses.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","startPage":"3248","endPage":"3255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Limits in DS-CDMA Timing Acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Limits in DS-CDMA Timing Acquisition","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9620969","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362488/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Limits in DS-CDMA Timing Acquisition","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10988S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362490,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Research TechnoPlaza, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362490/4362490-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinghua Shi received his Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from Southeast University, China, in 2000.

The ORC output instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however, takes the form of a harmonic mean of SNRs on different subcarriers, making its error performance difficult to analyze. In this paper, we tackle the problem in the framework of characteristic functions (CF) ending up with useful results for various modulation schemes including M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM). The general solution for arbitrary real m can be evaluated numerically, and reduces to closed form for m being an odd multiple of half. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis. It is found that in general MQAM outperforms MPSK, and the error performance of MC-CDMA with ORC is insensitive to the number of subcarriers and to the correlation among subcarriers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Probability of Multicarrier CDMA with Orthogonality Restoring Combining Over Nakagami-m Fading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06030","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362490.pdf","startPage":"3268","endPage":"3276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","displayDocTitle":"Error Probability of Multicarrier CDMA with Orthogonality Restoring Combining Over Nakagami-m Fading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4362490/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Probability of Multicarrier CDMA with Orthogonality Restoring Combining Over Nakagami-m Fading","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079687S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362491,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Fujitsu Research and Development Center Company Limited, Beijing, China","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Beijing, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362491/4362491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Zhang received the M.Sc degree in mathematics from the Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2002.

However, these assumptions corrupt the analysis especially in certain operating conditions such as a relatively small number of users, which is particularly relevant for modern CDMA systems that carry data. The contribution of this paper is to provide a general framework for accurately analyzing the performance of the diversity receiver in CDMA systems without these compromising approximations.

Even approximations to the optimal decoder, such as iterating between detection and decoding, are too complex for many practical systems. Thus, we consider a number of spatial stream decouplers with the assumption of separate decoding and decoupling. The linear zero-forcing decoupler, the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) decoupler, the successive soft/hard interference canceller, and the parallel soft/hard interference canceller are investigated. The capacity of the channel including these constrained receiver structures is analyzed. It is shown that no other decoupler can achieve larger capacity than the LMMSE decoupler in a sense that it achieves the maximum sub-channel capacities. This contrasts the general belief that interference cancellation schemes are better than linear filters. This is because this general belief is based on the assumption of perfect interference cancellation, which, in practice, requires joint decoding/decoupling. We discuss the likelihood value derivation from the decouplers, which can be used for decoding error correction codes. The performance of parallel transmission of turbo-coded symbols is given to support the constrained capacity analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362494.pdf","startPage":"3306","endPage":"3314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity for suboptimal receivers for coded multiple-input multiple-output systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362494/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity for suboptimal receivers for coded multiple-input multiple-output systems","volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9686010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362494/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity for suboptimal receivers for coded multiple-input multiple-output systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064976S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4362495,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios S.

CQEI is simple to evaluate, since it depends on the channel statistics which vary much more slowly than the channel state itself, and thus can be obtained at the initialization state using a long training sequence and afterwards continuously improved during the whole communication period. Considering generalized fading channels (Nakagami-m, Nakagami-n, Nakagami-q) and a variety of modulations, we show that CQEI assesses the average error performance of a communication system more efficiently, compared to other long- term performance criteria such as the average signal to noise ratio (ASNR) and the amount of fading (AoF). As an application, we utilize CQEI to present a new class of equal gain combining (EGC) receivers operating over non-identical independent fading channels, called selection-EGC (S-EGC). This kind of receivers reduces or eliminates the combining loss by rejecting the weak branches that contribute more to increasing the noise than the signal during the combining stage. S-EGC could be efficiently applied in the emerging broadband communication systems (e.g., ultra-wideband), where the number of diversity paths can be considerably large due to the strong multipath effects. Numerical results show that the new proposed selection-EGC (S-EGC) receiver outperforms the classical one, when fading with non- identically distributed diversity branches is assumed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362495.pdf","startPage":"3315","endPage":"3323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Quality Estimation Index (CQEI): A Long-Term Performance Metric for Fading Channels and an Application in EGC Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362495/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Quality Estimation Index (CQEI): A Long-Term Performance Metric for Fading Channels and an Application in EGC Receivers","volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628224","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362495/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Quality Estimation Index (CQEI): A Long-Term Performance Metric for Fading Channels and an Application in EGC Receivers","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112089S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4362501,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Das","affiliation":["Airvana, Inc., Chelmsford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362501/4362501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deepak Das (M'0l) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Col-orado, Boulder, CO, in 2001.

In this paper, the performance of orthogonal space-time block codes in MIMO fading channels under keyhole condition is analyzed. Closed-form expressions for the error probability of space-time block codes as well as diversity gains of keyhole channels are derived. We prove that the maximum spatial diversity gain of a keyhole channel with to transmit and n receive antennas is min(m, n) when m ne n. In the case of m = n, the achievable diversity gain is less than n but higher than n - 1. Accordingly, for space-time block codes in keyhole channels, there are two forms of error rate expressions for m ne n and m = n, respectively. Furthermore, coding gains of various space-time block codes in keyhole channels are obtained.

Link adaptation technique allows multi-rate transmission which is assumed to be achieved through adaptive modulation and coding. The radio link level queueing models for these two ARQ protocols are formulated in discrete time where the exact queue length and the delay statistics are obtained by using matrix geometric methods under different feedback delay values, channel and system parameters. The link layer delay statistics are useful in many ways, for example, to perform packet level admission control under statistical delay constraints. We validate the analysis by simulation and discuss useful implications of the analytical model on system performance. For dynamic link adaptation, the mode switching thresholds for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be chosen to obtain very good link level delay performance. This SNR partitioning is shown to achieve significant cross-layer design gain compared to the case where the mode switching thresholds are chosen to maximize the physical layer throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queueing Analysis for GBN and SR ARQ Protocols under Dynamic Radio Link Adaptation with Non-Zero Feedback Delay","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06020038","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362506.pdf","startPage":"3418","endPage":"3428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06020038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","displayDocTitle":"Queueing Analysis for GBN and SR ARQ Protocols under Dynamic Radio Link Adaptation with Non-Zero Feedback Delay","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4362506/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9692380","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queueing Analysis for GBN and SR ARQ Protocols under Dynamic Radio Link Adaptation with Non-Zero Feedback Delay","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078517S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4362507,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Garcia-Lozano","affiliation":["Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362507/4362507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mario Garcia-Lozano received the Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Spain, in 2001.

In particular, the real different path delays, taking into account the repeaters presence and the finite nature of the time window of Rake receivers are considered. This allows an enhanced analysis with respect to classical approaches from a system level viewpoint. Furthermore, higher reliable and accurate predictions on network performance can be obtained, which can be remarkably useful for network planning and management. By using these expressions, relevant network parameters have been evaluated and compared with the ones obtained using the classical approximations. The differences in the obtained metrics are highlighted, putting in evidence the improvement provided by the proposed analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","startPage":"3429","endPage":"3439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Analysis of WCDMA Networks with Repeaters Deployment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Analysis of WCDMA Networks with Repeaters Deployment","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9686012","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362507/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Analysis of WCDMA Networks with Repeaters Deployment","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077986S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4362508,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiao","affiliation":["Telecommunication Theory Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362508/4362508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Xiao (S'02) was born in the SiChuan Province, P.

The system uses LDGM codes as an outer code for CPM. For additive white Gaussian noise channels, we derive the union bound to analyze the error floor performance. Design principles for lowering error floors are suggested from this analysis. We propose a design approach of jointly considering the LDGM code degree and the CPM modulation index. Then we consider the rate-adaptive system for slowly fading channels. By changing the rate of the LDGM codes, the information rate of the CPM signals is adapted according to channel variations. We use a low-rate LDGM code as the mother code. Higher rates are achieved by puncturing the output of these codes. To exploit the rate-flexible property of punctured LDGM codes, a rate function is proposed to calculate the rate of each transmitted block. Thus, we can have a quasi-continuous information rate. Numerical results show that this approach can improve the energy efficiency from a discrete-rate adaptation. Using the rate-adaptive approach, up to 11 dB transmitted energy gain can be achieved from the non-adaptive scheme in the low bit-error-rate region (smaller than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n) for minimum shift keying (MSK).","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06020051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362508.pdf","startPage":"3440","endPage":"3449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06020051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Analysis and Design of Low Density Generator Matrix Codes for Continuous Phase Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Analysis and Design of Low Density Generator Matrix Codes for Continuous Phase Modulation","volume":"6","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9628231","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362508/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362508/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Analysis and Design of Low Density Generator Matrix Codes for Continuous Phase Modulation","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058935S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4362509,"authors":[{"name":"Aggelos Bletsas","affiliation":["Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Radiocommunications Laboratory, Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4362468/4362509/4362509-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aggelos Bletsas (S'03-M'05) received with excellence his diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece in 1998.

In particular, we consider distributed relay-selection algorithms requiring only local channel knowledge. We show that opportunistic DaF relaying is outage-optimal, that is, it is equivalent in outage behavior to the optimal DaF strategy that employs all potential relays. We further show that opportunistic AaF relaying is outage-optimal among single-relay selection methods and significantly outperforms an AaF strategy based on equal-power multiple-relay transmissions with local channel knowledge. These findings reveal that cooperation offers diversity benefits even when cooperative relays choose not to transmit but rather choose to cooperatively listen; they act as passive relays and give priority to the transmission of a single opportunistic relay. Numerical and simulation results are presented to verify our analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.06020050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.06020050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4362468/04362509.pdf","startPage":"3450","endPage":"3460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communications with Outage-Optimal Opportunistic Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communications with Outage-Optimal Opportunistic Relaying","volume":"6","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362509/","publicationDate":"September 2007","accessionNumber":"9628232","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communications with Outage-Optimal Opportunistic Relaying","sourcePdf":"tw_0709_3450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110734S","chronDate":"September  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4362468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"860","xplore-issue":"4362468","articleId":"4362509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4362514,"authors":[{"name":"Ray-Lee Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4362514/4362514-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ray-Lee Lin (SM'02) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tatung University (formerly Tatung Institute of Technology), Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VA Tech), Blacksburg, in 2001.","From October 1988 to October 1994, he was with the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Armament Bureau, Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, as a Research and Development Specialist working to design and develop servo-actuator control systems, including servo-motor and servo-hydraulic control systems. in January 1995, he enrolled as a doctoral student in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, VA Tech, and became a member of the Virginia Power Electronics Center and the Center for Power Electronics Systems. in May 2000, he joined GE Lighting, Cleveland, OH, as an Electronics Design Engineer working to design and develop cost-effective, high-performance electronic ballasts for HID and fluorescent lamps.

Though there are many methodologies for assigning responsibilities to classes, they all rely on human judgment and decision making. Our objective is to provide decision-making help to re-assign methods and attributes to classes in a class diagram. Our solution is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and uses class coupling and cohesion measurement. Our MOGA takes as input a class diagram to be optimized and suggests possible improvements to it. The choice of a MOGA stems from the fact that there are typically many evaluation criteria that cannot be easily combined into one objective, and several alternative solutions are acceptable for a given OO domain model. This article presents our approach in detail, our decisions regarding the multi-objective genetic algorithm, and reports on a case study. Our results suggest that the MOGA can help correct suboptimal class responsibility assignment decisions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSM.2007.4362625","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362596/4362597/04362625.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"133","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2007.4362625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to Support Class Responsibility Assignment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to Support Class Responsibility Assignment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9777409","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362625/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to Support Class Responsibility Assignment","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"ICSM-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083932S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362596","isNumber":"4362597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362596","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4362597","articleId":"4362625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4362691,"authors":[{"name":"Gong-Ru Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4397111/4362691/4362691-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gong-Ru Lin (M'96\u2013SM'04) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1990 and 1996, respectively.","He is currently the Vice Chairman with the Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The key issue is the achievement of a sparse model, i.e., a model in which all irrelevant parameters are set exactly to zero. Alternatively to standard maximum likelihood estimation (Baum Welch training), in the proposed approach the parameters estimation problem is cast into a Bayesian framework, with the introduction of a negative Dirichlet prior, which strongly encourages sparseness of the model. A modified Expectation Maximization algorithm has been devised, able to determine a MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) estimate of HMM parameters in this Bayesian formulation. Theoretical considerations and experimental comparative evaluations on a 2D shape classification task contribute to validate the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362759","publicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362741/4362742/04362759.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparseness Achievement in Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362759/","displayDocTitle":"Sparseness Achievement in Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9874572","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362759/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparseness Achievement in Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Modena, Italy","sourcePdf":"28770067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106922S","chronDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362741","isNumber":"4362742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362741","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4362742","articleId":"4362759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362796,"authors":[{"name":"Harald B.

In the framework, there are two key issues: robust motion estimation and appropriate measurement discarding for reconstruction. An approach to increase the robustness of motion estimation for a multi sampled image sequence is presented. By extracting the luminance component from each captured image in the sequence, and then enhancing the low intensity regions, conventional motion estimation methods can be applied with good results. The research also presents a novel discarding method of invalid measurements. The proposed spatio-temporal discarding method prevents over- discarding in the case of extreme exposure differences. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Dynamic range","Image resolution","Image sequences","Spatial resolution","Motion estimation","Layout","Brightness","Robustness","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","image sequences","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high dynamic range","high resolution image reconstruction","multisampled image sequence","high spatial resolution","robust motion estimation","spatiotemporal discarding method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362796","publicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362741/4362742/04362796.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of a High Dynamic Range and High Resolution Image from a Multisampled Image Sequence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of a High Dynamic Range and High Resolution Image from a Multisampled Image Sequence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362796/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362796/","accessionNumber":"9874609","conferenceDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of a High Dynamic Range and High Resolution Image from a Multisampled Image Sequence","confLoc":"Modena, Italy","sourcePdf":"28770303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05171S","chronDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362741","isNumber":"4362742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362741","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4362742","articleId":"4362796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4362798,"authors":[{"name":"Oswald Lanz","affiliation":["Bruno Kessler Foundation-irst, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Oswald","lastName":"Lanz","id":"37428426100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2877-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2877-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4362798","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"To become robust, a tracking algorithm must be able to support uncertainty and ambiguity often inherently present in the data in form of occlusion and clutter. This comes usually at the price of more demanding computations. Sampling methods, such as the popular particle filter, accommodate this capability and provide a means of controlling the computational trade-off by adapting their resolution. This paper presents a method for adapting resolution on-the-fly to current demands. The key idea is to select the number of samples necessary to populate the high probability regions with a predefined density. The scheme then allocates more particles when uncertainty is high while saving resources otherwise. The resulting tracker propagates compact while consistent representations and enables for reliable real time operation otherwise compromised.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information filtering","Information filters","Particle filters","Layout","State estimation","Particle tracking","Uncertainty","Bayesian methods","Robustness","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","information theory","particle filtering (numerical methods)","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theoretic rule","sample size adaptation","particle filtering","tracking algorithm","sampling method","probability region","image resolution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362798","publicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362741/4362742/04362798.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAP.2007.4362798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An information theoretic rule for sample size adaptation in particle filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An information theoretic rule for sample size adaptation in particle filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362798/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362798/","accessionNumber":"9874611","conferenceDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An information theoretic rule for sample size adaptation in particle filtering","confLoc":"Modena, Italy","sourcePdf":"28770317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039368S","chronDate":"10-14 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362741","isNumber":"4362742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362741","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4362742","articleId":"4362798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362810,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Colombo","affiliation":["DISCo Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Comunicazione, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Colombo","id":"37557669900"},{"name":"Claudio Cusano","affiliation":["DISCo Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Comunicazione, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cusano","id":"37294068600"},{"name":"Raimondo Schettini","affiliation":["DISCo Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Comunicazione, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Raimondo","lastName":"Schettini","id":"37294067800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2877-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2877-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4362810","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Face recognition","Face detection","Nose","Eyes","Image recognition","Layout","Image restoration","Image analysis","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face recognition system","Face3","automatic people recognition","2D images","3D images","3D face detector","face restoration"]}],"abstract":"We present Face3, a system for the automatic recognition of people using 2D and 3D images.

The result is an automatically generated, domain-neutral lexicon of verbs, similar to a natural language dictionary, that represents the common usages of many programmers.","doi":"10.1109/SCAM.2007.18","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362882/4362883/04362913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAM.2007.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362883","startPage":"193","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Programmer's Lexicon, Volume I: The Verbs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Programmer's Lexicon, Volume I: The Verbs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362913/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9875872","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4362913/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Programmer's Lexicon, Volume I: The Verbs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"28800193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063588S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362882","isNumber":"4362883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362882","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4362883","articleId":"4362913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4362915,"authors":[{"name":"Dawn Lawrie","affiliation":["Loyola College, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Lawrie","id":"37599910700"},{"name":"Henry Feild","affiliation":["Loyola College, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Feild","id":"37714194100"},{"name":"David Binkley","affiliation":["Loyola College, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Binkley","id":"37275658000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2880-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2880-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4362915","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Software quality","Dictionaries","Information retrieval","Software engineering","Libraries","Documentation","Educational institutions","USA Councils","Programming profession"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse engineering","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abbreviated program identifier meaning extraction","program understandability","program comprehension","syntactic violation identification","software quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Quality","Program Identifiers","Program Comprehension"]}],"abstract":"Informative identifiers are made up of full (natural language) words and (meaningful) abbreviations. Readers of programs typically have little trouble understanding the purpose of identifiers composed of full words. In addition, those familiar with the code can (most often) determine the meaning of abbreviations used in identifiers. However, when faced with unfamiliar code, abbreviations often carry little useful information. Furthermore, tools that focus on the natural language used in the code have a hard time in the presence of abbreviations. One approach to providing meaning to programmers and tools is to translate (expand) abbreviations into full words. This paper presents a methodology for expanding identifiers and evaluates the process on a code based of just over 35 million lines of code. For example, using phrase extraction, \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fs_exists</b>\n is expanded to \n<b xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">file_status_exists</b>\n illustrating how the expansion process can facilitate comprehension. On average, 16 percent of the identifiers in a program are expanded. Finally, as an example application, the approach is used to improve the syntactic identification of violations to Deissenbock and Pizka's rules for concise and consistent identifier construction.","doi":"10.1109/SCAM.2007.17","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4362882/4362883/04362915.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAM.2007.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4362883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Meaning from Abbreviated Identifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4362915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4362915/","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Meaning from Abbreviated Identifiers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9875874","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4362915/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Meaning from Abbreviated Identifiers","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"28800213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107596S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4362882","isNumber":"4362883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4362882","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4362883","articleId":"4362915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4365454,"authors":[{"name":"Xiyu Liu","affiliation":["School of Management and Economics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Xiyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406534700"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279507300"},{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37964506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0970-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0971-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4365454","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Manifolds","Space technology","Mobile computing","Geometry","Engineering management","Convergence","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computing","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile particle swarm optimization","curved space","nonuniform data distribution","convergence analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Manifold","mobile computing","particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPCA.2007.4365454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4365454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPCA.2007.4365454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4365395","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4365394/4365395/04365454.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Particle Swarm Optimization on Manifolds","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an increasingly used optimization technique which is derived from biology.

Nowadays, there are several proposed task scheduling algorithms which can be applied in the pervasive computing environment. But most of the existing algorithms are based on static task priority and singular predecessor duplication. And they can not schedule tasks effectively. Consequently, considering these drawbacks and combining the attribute of the pervasive computing, a task scheduling algorithm based on dynamic critical path and multitask duplication (HDCPD) is presented. The HDCPD algorithm is a list and duplication based scheduling algorithm that not only makes use of the dynamical critical path to computing the task priority effectively, but also consider the multi-level task to be duplicated. The simulation results show that this algorithm significantly surpasses previous algorithms in SLR and speedup rate metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4365487/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4365487/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9724586","conferenceDate":"26-27 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Heterogeneous Dynamic Critical Path and Duplication based Task Scheduling Algorithm for Pervasive Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heterogeneous Dynamic Critical Path and Duplication based Task Scheduling Algorithm for Pervasive Computing","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"ICPCA-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075145S","chronDate":"26-27 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4365394","isNumber":"4365395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4365394","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4365395","articleId":"4365487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4365510,"authors":[{"name":"Baifeng Wu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Baifeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275267100"},{"name":"Songwen Pei","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Songwen","lastName":"Pei","id":"37396862400"},{"name":"Kun Zhu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37291106500"},{"name":"Qiang Yu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37291676000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0970-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0971-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4365510","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"abstract":"Currently the compiler technology is far from the need of fully exploring the benefits of chip multi-core architecture of nowadays microprocessor.

In recent years ion electron emission microscopy (IEEM) is emerging as an innovative method for device characterization. An advanced implementation of this instrument is under development at the SIRAD irradiation facility at the Legnaro national laboratory (LNL). The aim of this work is the final test and the characterization of the SIRAD IEEM in a realistic environment by using synchronus dynamic RAM (SDRAM) commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices to confirm the capability of the SIRAD IEEM to map out the single event effect (SEE) sensitivity of a typical microelectronic device and to measure its resolution. A potential problem during IEEM operations is the large number of ions that have to be collected on the device under test (DUT) that will induce a degradation of the device characteristics similar to that generated by total ionizing dose (TID). This paper investigates this issue and proposes an online method to monitor the degradation of the devices under test based on the measurement of the bit retention time (BRT), that is the time the information is retained in a memory cell without refresh in SDRAM devices. This paper presents the experimental setup and the results of TID and SEE tests performed to validate the method. The results of TID tests with \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">60</sup>\nCo gamma ray, initially performed to investigate the method, show that BRT measurements could be used to online monitor the level of TID the device accumulates. The same tests performed during heavy ion irradiation show that ions produce similar effects on the SDRAM so that BRT could be used during IEEM operation to monitor the degradation of the DUT.

In this paper, we propose a different approach to enhance edge computing. Our approach lies in a wide area data replication protocol that enables the delivery of dynamic content with full consistency guarantees and with all the benefits of edge computing, such as low latency and high scalability. What is more, the proposed solution is fully transparent to the applications that are brought to the edge.

One of the promising approaches is online failure prediction, which means that the current state of the system is evaluated in order to predict the occurrence of failures in the near future. More specifically, we focus on methods that use event-driven sources such as errors. We use hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs)for this purpose and demonstrate effectiveness based on field data of a commercial telecommunication system. For comparative analysis we selected three well-known failure prediction techniques: a straightforward method that is based on a reliability model, dispersion frame technique by Lin and Siewiorek and the eventset-based method introduced by Vilalta et al. We assess and compare the methods in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, false-positive rate, and computing time. The experiments suggest that our HSMM approach is very effective with respect to online failure prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 26th IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4365668/4365669/04365693.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"2007 26th IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2007)","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2007.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2007.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4365669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4365693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Hidden Semi-Markov Models for Effective Online Failure Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Failure analysis","Runtime","Fault detection","Fault tolerant systems","Condition monitoring","Preventive maintenance","Scheduling","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","fault diagnosis","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden semiMarkov models","faults proactive handling","online failure prediction","event-driven sources","commercial telecommunication system","failure prediction techniques","event set-based method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4365693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using Hidden Semi-Markov Models for Effective Online Failure Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4365693/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9879669","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Hidden Semi-Markov Models for Effective Online Failure Prediction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"29950161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070596S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4365668","isNumber":"4365669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4365668","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4365669","articleId":"4365693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4365694,"authors":[{"name":"Song Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Fu","id":"37274930100"},{"name":"Cheng-Zhong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Cheng-Zhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278305300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2995-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"4365694","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer networks","Production systems","Computer network management","Distributed computing","Stochastic processes","Failure analysis","Computer network reliability","Engineering management","USA Councils","Grid computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","grid computing","object-oriented programming","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal correlation","spatial correlation","proactive management","networked computing systems","component complexity","interaction complexity","component failures","timescale parameter","stochastic model","application allocation","failure instances","cluster failure events","production coalition system","Wayne State Grid","predicting system","failure correlations","cluster coalition environment"]}],"abstract":"Networked computing systems continue to grow in scale and in the complexity of their components and interactions. Component failures become norms instead of exceptions in these environments. Moreover, failure events exhibit strong correlations in time and space domain.

Recent changes to some standards, such as the NFPA-70E; have emphasized the need to look for improved safety compliance to mitigating the risks associated with the operation and maintenance of electrical equipment. The requirements for employee safe work practices have all targeted reducing the risks of electrical arc hazards. However, arcs accompanied by explosions continue to occur in electrical systems. Factors such as inappropriate human interaction with the equipment, equipment malfunctions because of misuse or lack of regular maintenance or unforeseen events continue to contribute to the unexpected release of explosive electrical energy in the workplace. New arc resistant MV control equipment designs provide an additional level of protection if properly installed and applied. This paper will outline the added benefits of arc resistant equipment along with the details surrounding the appropriate installation and site application considerations when arc resistant MV control products are being considered.

Many representations introduced previously assign values to indicate the four DNA nucleotides A, C, G, and T that impose mathematical structures not present in the actual DNA sequence. In this paper, almost all existing methods are compared for the purpose of identifying protein coding regions, using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based spectral content measure to exploit period-3 behaviour in the exonic regions for the GENSCAN test set. False positive vs. sensitivity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and exonic nucleotides detected as false positive results all show that the two newly proposed numerical of DNA representations perform better than the well-known Z-curve, tetrahedron, and Voss representations, with 66-75% less processing. By comparison with Voss representation, the proposed paired numeric method can produce relative improvements of up to 12% in terms of prediction accuracy of exonic nucleotides at a 10% false positive rate using the GENSCAN test set.","doi":"10.1109/GENSIPS.2007.4365821","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4365810/4365811/04365821.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GENSIPS.2007.4365821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4365811","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On DNA Numerical Representations for Period-3 Based Exon Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4365821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On DNA Numerical Representations for Period-3 Based Exon Prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4365821/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9776794","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4365821/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On DNA Numerical Representations for Period-3 Based Exon Prediction","confLoc":"Tuusula, Finland","sourcePdf":"GENSIPS-00-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062586S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4365810","isNumber":"4365811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4365810","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4365811","articleId":"4365821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4365836,"authors":[{"name":"Raman Arora","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Raman","lastName":"Arora","id":"37631435800"},{"name":"William A.

It is very interesting to use the super-structure fiber-Bragg-grating-based en/decoders to construct a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)-compatible OCDMA system. Based on the equivalent phase-shift technique, we have proposed a subsampled-Bragg-grating (S-SBG)-based en/decoder. Based on the proposed method, only a single uniform phase mask can be used to accommodate different WDM channels with relevant central wavelengths and spectrum width. Using the S-SBG-based en/decoder, we can make different WDM channels have similar as well as better encoding efficiency and correlation performance.

The proposed model is therefore a precious tool for the design of multilevel PCM applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change memory","Phase change materials","Crystallization","Voltage","Amorphous materials","Temperature","Nonvolatile memory","Resistors","Physics","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","integrated memory circuits","phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memory compact model","multilevel applications","electrical features","RESET state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact model","multilevel (ML)","nonvolatile memory","phase change memory (PCM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367575","doi":"10.1109/LED.2007.907288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/4367538/04367575.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2007.907288","startPage":"973","endPage":"975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Phase Change Memory Compact Model for Multilevel Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Phase Change Memory Compact Model for Multilevel Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367575/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","volume":"28","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4367575/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671408","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phase Change Memory Compact Model for Multilevel Applications","sourcePdf":"28led11-ventrice.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067651S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4367538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4367538","articleId":"4367575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4367587,"authors":[{"name":"Sanae Boulay","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK","Institut d'Electronique de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Nanotechnologie, Unit\u00e9 mixte de Recherche, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) 8520, Universit\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies de Lille, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4367582/4367587/4367587-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanae Boulay was born in Paris, France, on January 19, 1979.

Finally, simulation results for the magnitude of the threshold voltage variations induced by the poly-Si granularity are presented for a set of carefully scaled ldquorealisticrdquo bulk MOSFETs with gate lengths of 35, 25, 18, 13, and 9 nm and are compared with the variations introduced by random discrete dopants and line-edge roughness.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.907802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4367582/04367588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.907802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367582","startPage":"3056","endPage":"3063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poly-Si-Gate-Related Variability in Decananometer MOSFETs With Conventional Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Poly-Si-Gate-Related Variability in Decananometer MOSFETs With Conventional Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671309","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4367588/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poly-Si-Gate-Related Variability in Decananometer MOSFETs With Conventional Architecture","sourcePdf":"54ted11-brown.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083418S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4367582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4367582","articleId":"4367588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4367599,"authors":[{"name":"Anwar Jarndal","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Hodeidah University, Hodeidah, Yemen"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4367582/4367599/4367599-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anwar Jarndal (S'04) was born in Zabid, Yemen, in 1973.

The measurement method uses the difference between the thermal conductivities of air and water vapor at high temperatures by comparing the output voltages of two heated and thermally isolated diodes; one of which is exposed to the environment and has a humidity-dependent thermal conductance, while the other is sealed and has a fixed thermal conductance. Thermal isolation is obtained by a simple front-end bulk silicon etching process in a TMAH solution, while the diodes are protected by the electrochemical etch-stop technique. The suspended diodes are connected to an on-chip circuit using polysilicon interconnect layers in order to increase their thermal resistance to be able to heat them with less power. Due to the high electrical resistance and positive temperature coefficient of resistance of the polysilicon, temperature sensitivities of the diodes are reduced to -1.3 mV/K at a 100-muA bias level. The diodes and the readout circuit are monolithically integrated using a standard 0.6-mum CMOS process. Characterization results show that humidity sensitivity of the sensor is 14.3, 26, and 46.9 mV/%RH for 20degC, 30degC, and 40degC, respectively, with a nonlinearity less than 0.3%.

Generally, a well tap was not set at every SRAM unit cell so as to increase the packing density. We have introduced a model structure where a p-well for arranging the driver n-MOSFET in a CMOS inverter does not have the well tap in the analyzed cell, and we have studied the inverter action when a drain junction of the n-MOSFET in an OFF-state is hit by an alpha -particle. We found that the p-well is forwardly biased by generated excess carriers. The forward bias at the p-well switches the n-MOSFET from the OFF-to the ON-state, like an on action of an n-p-n transistor, and the output potential of the inverter changes from high to low. This bias change results in a flip on the state of the SRAM unit cell. When a series of n-MOSFETs (or p-MOSFETs) is arranged in the same well and the well tap is not arranged in every unit cell, the switch-on action of the MOSFET is sequentially induced, like a chain reaction. We have developed a multidrain model by adding a p-n junction around the n-MOSFET in the p-well and have successfully demonstrated the chain reaction. In addition, we have demonstrated the soft-error occurrence in an unit cell with the help of circuit simulation. This is the mechanism of multiple soft errors by the bipolar-mode operation. A key factor for evaluating the tolerance of the bipolar-mode soft error is a forwardly biased time at the well (i.e., a well-floating time). The well-floating time (t\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">float</sub>\n) is dependent on an initial charge (Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n) in the depletion layer and a resistance (-R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">well</sub>\n) between the well and the tap.

The image segmentation is performed over the BMR restored image. First, the user selects arbitrarily at least one region, and makes a subjective decision to choose the best estimate from among a set of restored images with different regularization parameter applied to the user-selected region. Then, using this decision the algorithm sets up a perception-based selection of the different regularization parameters for restoring in an adaptive fashion the whole image employing the MHNN computations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Degradation","Hopfield neural networks","Image segmentation","Statistics","Image resolution","Equations","Neurons","Gaussian noise","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Hopfield neural nets","image restoration","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive regularization image restoration","Hopfield neural network","local statistics","Bayesian minimum risk","restoration method","image segmentation","perception-based selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CERMA.2007.4367691","publicationTitle":"Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367641/4367642/04367691.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CERMA.2007.4367691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Regularization Image Restoration Using a Modified Hopfield Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Adaptive Regularization Image Restoration Using a Modified Hopfield Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367691/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4367691/","accessionNumber":"9877289","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Adaptive Regularization Image Restoration Using a Modified Hopfield Network","confLoc":"Cuernavaca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"29740229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038053S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367641","isNumber":"4367642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367641","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4367642","articleId":"4367691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4367702,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Manuel Ramirez","affiliation":["\u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica Coordinaci\u00f3n de Electr\u00f3nica Tonantzintla, Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Juan Manuel","lastName":"Ramirez","id":"37271421100"},{"name":"Pilar Gomez-Gil","affiliation":["Centro Interdisciplinario de Postgrado, Universidad Popular Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Pilar","lastName":"Gomez-Gil","id":"38277124200"},{"name":"Filiberto Lopez Larios","affiliation":["Departamento de Computaci\u00f3n, Electr\u00f3nica y Mecatr\u00f3nica, Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas-Puebla, Cholula, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Filiberto Lopez","lastName":"Larios","id":"38300548100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2974-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2974-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4367702","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":625},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Navigation","Control systems","Fuzzy logic","Automatic control","Robotics and automation","Machine vision","Real time systems","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","fuzzy control","navigation","remotely operated vehicles","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous vehicle","machine vision techniques","control remote car","computer vision techniques","fuzzy logic control"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a navigation system for an autonomous vehicle using machine vision techniques applied to real-time captured images of the track, for academic purposes.

In this paper, an approach to translate UML 2.0 notations to the SystemC language is presented. The UML notation is extended to represent SystemC elements through the adaptation of a UML profile for SystemC.

We consider sharing the MIMO increased rate in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) links. Such sharing allows nodes in a WMN to concurrently meet more demanding communication requirements such as high data rates, increased transmission range, power savings and low dropping rates. In this paper, we propose the rate splitting MIMO-based Mac protocol (RSMP) which is a distributed Mac protocol where pairs of nodes can locally cooperate with other nodes in their vicinities to reserve the required rate through effective selection on transmit antennas. Nodes can then use any preferable MIMO coding technique that best suit their communication requirements. RSMP is evaluated using OPNET interfaced with Matlab. OPNET is used to model the details of the Mac protocol while Matlab is used to compute the MIMO channel capacity and interference. Simulation results are obtained and compared to those of 802.11n MIMO-based DCF MAC protocol. We show that our proposed RSMP scheme outperforms MIMO DCF MAC in medium access delay and throughput. We also show that nodes can always attain their requested rate and that RSMP can be applied to satisfy multiple QoS requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Splitting MIMO-based MAC Protocol","publicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2007.89","displayPublicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367784/4367785/04367804.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2007.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Rate Splitting MIMO-based MAC Protocol","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4367804/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880381","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Splitting MIMO-based MAC Protocol","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"30000018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058901S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367784","isNumber":"4367785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367784","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4367785","articleId":"4367804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4367805,"authors":[{"name":"Hwee-Xian Tan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hwee-Xian","lastName":"Tan","id":"37404446700"},{"name":"Winston K.G.

Such networks are characterized by long and variable propagation delays, intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth and low bit rates. Due to the wireless mode of communication between the sensor nodes, a medium access control (MAC) protocol is required to coordinate access to the shared channel and enable efficient data communication. However, conventional terrestrial wireless network protocols that are based on RF technologies cannot be used underwater. In this paper, we propose PLAN - a MAC Protocol for Long-latency Access Networks that is designed for use in half-duplex underwater acoustic sensor networks. We utilize CDMA as the underlying multiple access technique, due to its resilience to multi-path and Doppler's effects prevalent in underwater environments, coupled with an RTS-CTS handshaking procedure prior to the actual data transmission.

This approach is used to compare the performance of some commonly used DiffServ AC techniques and also to design a novel AC algorithm based on queue estimates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal DiffServ AC Design using Non-Linear Programming","publicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2007.32","displayPublicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367784/4367785/04367891.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2007.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal DiffServ AC Design using Non-Linear Programming","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4367891/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880468","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal DiffServ AC Design using Non-Linear Programming","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"30000591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049767S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367784","isNumber":"4367785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367784","xplore-issue":"4367785","articleId":"4367891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4367909,"authors":[{"name":"Liexin Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liexin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37954556500"},{"name":"Jian Du","affiliation":["School of Electronics & Information Engineering, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Du","id":"37953218500"},{"name":"Guangxi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guangxi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281082400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3000-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3000-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4367909","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Delay systems","Fading","OFDM modulation","Adaptive systems","Power engineering and energy","Wireless networks","Application software","Transmitters","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","fading channels","OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","resource scheduling","delay limited OFDM system","wireless network","multicarrier system","fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmission buffer","optimization","MDP","dynamic programming","suboptimal power allocation algorithm","bit loading algorithm","greedy approach","single carrier system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive","MDP","power allocation","cross layer","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In the wireless networks, the power saving is highly important. The way of power saving by resource allocation and scheduling is attached more attention on recently. This paper explores optimal and suboptimal scheduling strategy for a multi- carrier system over fading channels. The scheduling objective is to minimize the average system power under the delay constraint. Specifically, we study the trade-offs between the total transmit power of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and the buffering delay of the packets in a transmission buffer. We formulate this optimization problem as a MDP and use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the optimal solution. Since finding the optimal policies becomes complex and practically un-realizable for large number of carriers in the system, we offer a suboptimal power allocation and bit loading algorithm using the results of the single carrier system and a greedy approach. Simulations show that the sub-optimal algorithm, which has reduced complexity, has performance close to the optimal one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation and Scheduling for the Delay Limited OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2007.156","displayPublicationTitle":"32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367784/4367785/04367909.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2007.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4367909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Allocation and Scheduling for the Delay Limited OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4367909/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880486","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Resource Allocation and Scheduling for the Delay Limited OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"30000731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057296S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367784","isNumber":"4367785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367784","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4367785","articleId":"4367909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4367962,"authors":[{"name":"Ron A.

Ceph is a highly scalable distributed file system that can scale up to tens of thousands of object-based storage devices (OSDs). The Bourbon framework enables Ceph to become QoS-aware by providing the capability to isolate performance between different classes of workloads. The Bourbon framework is enabled by Q-EBOFS, a QoS-aware enhancement of the EBOFS object-based file system. Q-EBOFS allows individual OSDs to become QoS-aware, and by leveraging on the random element of the CRUSH data distribution algorithm employed by Ceph, it is possible for a collection of independent QoS-aware OSDs to provide class-based performance isolation at the global level. This preserves the highly scalable nature of Ceph by avoiding the introduction of any centralized components or the need to collect and propagate global state information. This paper presents the Bourbon framework by first describing Q-EBOFS, and then examines how a collection of OSDs running Q-EBOFS can work together to provide global-level QoS.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2007.4367971","publicationTitle":"24th IEEE Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"24th IEEE Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367953/4367954/04367971.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2007.4367971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Quality of Service Support in Object-Based File System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Providing Quality of Service Support in Object-Based File System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9880361","htmlLink":"/document/4367971/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing Quality of Service Support in Object-Based File System","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30250157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046938S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367953","isNumber":"4367954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367953","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4367954","articleId":"4367971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4367989,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy Bisson","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Bisson","id":"37293796200"},{"name":"Scott A.

By using the NVCache to satisfy writes while the rotating media is spun-down, hard disk power consumption can be decreased by lengthening low-power periods. However, the NVCache must eventually be flushed back to the rotating media in order to cache additional data. In this paper we explore two questions: when and how should NVCache content be flushed to rotating media in order to minimize the overhead of data synchronization. We show that by using traditional I/O mechanisms such as merging and reordering, combined with a \"flush only when full\" policy, flushing performance improves significantly.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2007.4367989","startPage":"299","publicationTitle":"24th IEEE Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"24th IEEE Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367953/4367954/04367989.pdf","endPage":"304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2007.4367989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4367989/","displayDocTitle":"Flushing Policies for NVCache Enabled Hard Disks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4367989/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9880378","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flushing Policies for NVCache Enabled Hard Disks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30250299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051311S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367953","isNumber":"4367954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367953","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4367954","articleId":"4367989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4368002,"authors":[{"name":"Hitoshi Isahara","affiliation":["Computational Linguistics Group, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Isahara","id":"37283338500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1610-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1611-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4368002","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1930},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural language processing","Computational linguistics","Humans","Dictionaries","Large-scale systems","Software tools","Communications technology","Information analysis","Data mining","Research and development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","information retrieval","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","rule-based methodology","grammar rules","dictionary entries","corpus-based","statistical systems","linguistic resources","quality language analyzer","linguistic information extraction","knowledge processing","machine translation","information retrieval"]}],"abstract":"Research on natural language processing (NLP) started with so-called rule-based methodology, however, compilation of huge amount of grammar rules and dictionary entries are too difficult to develop practical systems.

Combining such linguistic resources and high quality language analyzer, we can extract useful linguistic information and develop practical systems for specific domain.

Moreover, when a log-linear model is built using features from both phrase-and word-based techniques, the tagging accuracy improved on both of our data sets yielding the highest reported performance to date on the more ambiguous tagset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phrase-based Part-of-Speech Tagging","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2007.4368036","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4367991/4367992/04368036.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2007.4368036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4367992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4368036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4368036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2007-Sept. 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Phrase-based Part-of-Speech Tagging","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4368036/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9765836","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phrase-based Part-of-Speech Tagging","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"NLPKE-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035316S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2007-Sept. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4367991","isNumber":"4367992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4367991","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4367992","articleId":"4368036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4368097,"authors":[{"name":"Adam S.W.

To ensure the secure information transaction of the tag, traditionally the focus is on directly applying a low-complexity encryption engine. However, this approach could lead to the problem of known-plaintext attack (KPA). The attacker could make use of the known header to reveal the secret key. Our contributions are proposing a novel dataflow solution enforced by an AES cryptography engine embedded inside the passive RFID tag. Also, various low power design techniques are proposed to reduce the power consumption of the baseband of the passive tag. In particular, we propose a moving window PIE decoding algorithm and an improved Tausworthe sequence generator to reduce the power consumption. Other low power design techniques such as clock gating, optimal clock driving and parallel operations are extensively used in the design of the tag. The complete RFID tag which consists of an analog frontend, 136 bits one-time programmable (OTP) memory, charge pump, rectifier, clock divider, and the proposed baseband system, was designed using TSMC 0.18\u03bcm process and verified.

Most of the RFID networks include a wide range of automation technologies. These technologies are RFID readers, RFID writers, RFID barcode scanners, RFID smart sensors and RFID controllers. In this study, a solution has been provided for the problems encountered in parking-lot management systems via RFID technology. RFID readers, RFID labels, computers, barriers and software are used as for the main components of the RFID technology. The software has been handled for the management, controlling, transaction reporting and operation tasks for parking lots located on various parts of the city. Check-ins and check-outs of the parking-lots will be under control with RFID readers, labels and barriers. Personnel costs will be reduced considerably using this technology. It will be possible to see unmanned, secure, automized parking-lots functioning with RFID technology in the future. Check-ins and check-outs will be handled in a fast manner without having to stop the cars so that traffic jam problem will be avoided during these processes. Drivers will not have to stop at the circulation points and parking tickets will be out of usage during check-ins and check-outs. It will be avoided ticket-jamming problems for the ticket processing machines as well. Vehicle owners will not have to make any payments at each check-out thus a faster traffic flow will be possible. Since there won't be any waiting during check-ins and check-outs the formation of emission gas as a result of such waiting will be avoided. An automized income tracking system, a car tracking system for charging and a central parking-car tracking system have been developed and utilized. Instead of cars' parking on streets, a more modern and a fast operating parking-lot system have been developed.","doi":"10.1109/RFIDEURASIA.2007.4368108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIDEURASIA.2007.4368108","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 1st Annual RFID Eurasia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4368084/4368085/04368108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 1st Annual RFID Eurasia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4368085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Parking Applications Using RFID Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Smart Parking Applications Using RFID Technology","conferenceDate":"5-6 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4368108/","accessionNumber":"9776964","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4368108/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Parking Applications Using RFID Technology","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"RFIDEURASIA-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025269S","chronDate":"5-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4368084","isNumber":"4368085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4368084","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4368085","articleId":"4368108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Istanbul Technical UnivIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4368197,"authors":[{"name":"Leyza Baldo Dorini","affiliation":["Instituto de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, UNICAMP, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leyza Baldo","lastName":"Dorini","id":"37829437800"},{"name":"Rodrigo Minetto","affiliation":["Instituto de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, UNICAMP, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Minetto","id":"37397216300"},{"name":"Neucimar Jeronimo Leite","affiliation":["Instituto de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, UNICAMP, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Neucimar Jeronimo","lastName":"Leite","id":"37266957900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2996-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2996-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1834"}],"articleNumber":"4368197","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":864},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White blood cells","Image segmentation","Cells (biology)","Shape","Clustering algorithms","Morphology","Histograms","Partitioning algorithms","Bones","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","blood","cellular biophysics","image segmentation","mathematical morphology","mathematical operators","medical image processing","optical microscopy","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["white blood cell segmentation","morphological operator","scale-space analysis","video microscopy","disease diagnosis","toggle operator","image quality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4368197","abstract":"Cell segmentation is a challenging problem due to both the complex nature of the cells and the uncertainty present in video microscopy.

The penalties can also be increased after a rule violation to ensure that each of the selection rules are satisfied at a finite frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4369337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4369337/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671696","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An MILP Approach to Wafer Sampling and Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MILP Approach to Wafer Sampling and Selection","sourcePdf":"20tsm04-good.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058626S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4369323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4369323","articleId":"4369337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4369338,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Traditional univariate statistical process control charts have long been used for fault detection. Recently, multivariate statistical fault detection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods have drawn increasing interest in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix, and process steps with variable durations, have posed some difficulties to the PCA-based methods. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a fault detection method using the k-nearest neighbor rule (FD-kNN) is developed in this paper. Because in fault detection faults are usually not identified and characterized beforehand, in this paper the traditional kNN algorithm is adapted such that only normal operation data is needed. Because the developed method makes use of the kNN rule, which is a nonlinear classifier, it naturally handles possible nonlinearity in the data. Also, because the FD-kNN method makes decisions based on small local neighborhoods of similar batches, it is well suited for multimodal cases. Another feature of the proposed FD-kNN method, which is essential for online fault detection, is that the data preprocessing is performed automatically without human intervention. These capabilities of the developed FD-kNN method are demonstrated by simulated illustrative examples as well as an industrial example.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.907607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4369323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.907607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4369323/04369338.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection Using the k-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection Using the k-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes","volume":"20","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4369338/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674099","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4369338/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection Using the k-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Semiconductor Manufacturing Processes","sourcePdf":"20tsm04-he.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078781S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4369323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"4369323","articleId":"4369338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4369340,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00c9 Holfeld","affiliation":["AMD Saxony LLC and Company KG, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/4369323/4369340/4369340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andr\u00e9 Holfeld studied microelectronics at the Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, and at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and graduated in 2001.","He is an APC Engineer at AMD Saxony LLC and Company KG, Dresden.

This is done in order to characterize the manufacturing process by verifying correct processing and ensuring availability of adequate information on the contributors to process variance. In state-of-the-art technologies it has become increasingly challenging to measure all possible and relevant sources of variation. Because low cycle time (manufacturing duration) is of such high importance, it is necessary to minimize the amount of inspection operations/duration on processed material. This paper details the integrated lot-level and wafer-level sampling application deployed in AMD's Fab30 and Fab36, which is capable of providing the means to capture lot, wafer, and event-based sources of variation by best utilizing the available metrology resources. It will also highlight the connection of this application into the areas of advanced-process-control, run-to-run, fault-detection and classification (APC, RtR, FDC). </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4369323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.907613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4369323/04369340.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"399","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.907613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fab-Wide APC Sampling Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Fab-Wide APC Sampling Application","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4369340/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832003","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4369340/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fab-Wide APC Sampling Application","sourcePdf":"20tsm04-holfeld.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043199S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4369323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4369323","articleId":"4369340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4369341,"authors":[{"name":"Aftab A.

Application of factory-wide advanced process control (APC) techniques down to the wafer-to-wafer (W2W) level control capability is becoming the only choice to cope with the demanding situation. However, one of the main limitations in undertaking W2W control is the nonavailability of timely metrology data at the wafer level. Recently virtual metrology (VM) techniques have been proposed to provide timely wafer level metrology data; they have the potential to be used in realizing W2W control. In this paper, the VM approach to W2W control on factory level is described. VM for an individual process is realized by utilizing the preprocess metrology and the process data from the underlying tools that is generally collected in real time for fault detection purposes. The VM implementation for factory-wide run-to-run control brings unique opportunities and issues to the forefront such as dealing with expected lower quality of VM data, coordination between VM modules of cascading processes for better prediction quality, flexibility of the factory-wide controller to accommodate lower quality VM data, dynamic adjustments to the target values of individual processes by the factory-wide controller when using VM data, and dealing with metrology delays at the factory level. Near and long-term solutions are presented to address these issues in order to allow VM to be used today and become an integral part of the factory-wide APC solution for W2W control.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.907609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4369323/04369341.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.907609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4369323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach for Factory-Wide Control Utilizing Virtual Metrology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4369341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4369341/","displayDocTitle":"An Approach for Factory-Wide Control Utilizing Virtual Metrology","volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671697","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4369341/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach for Factory-Wide Control Utilizing Virtual Metrology","sourcePdf":"20tsm04-khan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097568S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4369323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4369323","articleId":"4369341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4369343,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/4369323/4369343/4369343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiming Li (M'02) received the B.S. degrees in applied mathematics and electronics engineering, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996, 1998, and 2001, respectively.","In 2001, he joined the National Nano Device Laboratories (NDL), Taiwan, as an Associate Researcher, and the Microelectronics and Information Systems Research Center (MISRC), National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), as an Assistant Professor, where he has been engaged in the field of computational science and engineering, particularly in modeling, simulation, and optimization of nanoelectronics and very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits.

This approach provides an alternative to accelerate the tuning of process parameters and benefits manufacturing of nanoscale CMOS devices.","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.907623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4369323/04369343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.907623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4369323","startPage":"432","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coupled-Simulation-and-Optimization Approach to Nanodevice Fabrication With Minimization of Electrical Characteristics Fluctuation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4369343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Coupled-Simulation-and-Optimization Approach to Nanodevice Fabrication With Minimization of Electrical Characteristics Fluctuation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4369343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671699","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4369343/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coupled-Simulation-and-Optimization Approach to Nanodevice Fabrication With Minimization of Electrical Characteristics Fluctuation","sourcePdf":"20tsm04-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097932S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4369323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4369323","articleId":"4369343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"}]
