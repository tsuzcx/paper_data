The objects are defined by their contours which are obtained using a hybrid first and second-order differential edge detector. The parts are isolated, and their parameters modelled by 2-D superquadrics, are obtained by the minimization of a best-fit cost function. The object is then represented by its structural description which are data structure whose predicates represent the parts and whose arguments represent the spatial relationship between the parts. This representation allows the recognition of objects independently of their position, orientation or size and is insensitive to partially missing parts. In this paper, examples illustrating acquired images of objects, the extraction of their contours, the isolation of the parts, and their fitting with 2-D superquadrics are reported. The recognition rate of the suggested vision system for simultaneously and randomly rotated, displaced and resized objects is also reported. This framework can also be used for the compression of images, where only an ASCII file describing the structural representation of the object is transmitted. The reconstruction of objects from their structural description is reported and improvements are suggested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system for automatic object recognition","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400036","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3184/9020/00400036.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1374 vol. 2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A vision system for automatic object recognition","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4986371","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system for automatic object recognition","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00400036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056762S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","citationCount":"1","articleId":"400036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":400050,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.

Different versions of genetic algorithms are developed to solve the three versions of problems. Among these versions of genetic algorithms, we have demonstrated two ways of applying the genetic algorithms, either to solve the problem directly or to tune an existing, heuristic algorithm so that the performance is improved, Experimental results are compared to well-known packing heuristics FFDH and HFF.

The algorithm processes the parameters themselves without coding. It can save the coding processing time and get more accurate values of the parameters.

The proposed control scheme consists of a traditional fuzzy logic (FL) controller and a conventional derivative (D) controller. The FL controller is used as a main controller to improve transient behaviors, e.g., a small maximum overshoot and a fast settling time, whereas the D controller is used as an auxiliary controller which is helpful for stabilizing system responses.

The basic idea is to implement a rule-based fuzzy control system with a neural network consisting of two subnetworks of pattern recognition, and fuzzy reasoning and control synthesis. The neural network is arranged such that the structure and operations of the original fuzzy control system can be fully retrieved from its network implementation. Equipped with the learning capability of neural networks, this implementation provides a mechanism to refine the existing rules and generate new rules for fuzzy control. It also opens a way for fuzzy control systems to exploit neural networks for carrying out their inherent parallel computation and suppressing the memory space required by their knowledge bases and inference programs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400112","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1808 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3184/9020/00400112.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning laws for neural-network implementation of fuzzy control systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Neural networks","Design methodology","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Pattern recognition","Fuzzy reasoning","Control system synthesis","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","adaptive control","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","control system synthesis","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning laws","neural-network implementation","adaptive fuzzy control system design","structured neural networks","rule-based fuzzy control system","subnetworks","pattern recognition","fuzzy reasoning","control synthesis","parallel computation","memory space suppression","knowledge bases","inference programs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning laws for neural-network implementation of fuzzy control systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","accessionNumber":"4973731","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning laws for neural-network implementation of fuzzy control systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00400112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042468S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","citationCount":"6","articleId":"400112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":400133,"authors":[{"name":"Ching Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Ching Zhang","id":"37087169196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2129-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"400133","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":24,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400133","abstract":"Genetic algorithms are a set of stochastic algorithms for efficient and robust search.

As examples, this approach is applied to a dataset of 11 natural earthquakes and 11 mining (chemical) explosions recorded by the NORESS array in Norway.

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using some relatively inexpensive pressure sensors and a neural network to achieve object localization and pattern recognition. The sensors used are force sensing resistors (FSRs), more specifically, a 16/spl times/16 array of FSRs. Because of the nonlinearities associated with a FSR, three approaches for gathering output from the sensor array are used. The neural network used consists of two 2-layer counterpropagation networks (CPNs). In addition to recognizing pre-trained patterns, this paper also demonstrates that the conventional CPN configuration can be modified to learn new patterns even when its training period is completed. Both simulated and experimental results of this paper suggest that the neural network can provide an alternative approach for object localization using tactile arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400176","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2119 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9021","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/3184/9021/00400176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of adaptive neural network to localization of objects using pressure array transducer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400176/","displayDocTitle":"Application of adaptive neural network to localization of objects using pressure array transducer","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4980344","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of adaptive neural network to localization of objects using pressure array transducer","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00400176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030758S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","articleId":"400176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":400179,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The analysis encompasses the identification of the business cycle turning points, i.e., the dates of recessions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400232/","accessionNumber":"4980400","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network for signal modelling in business cycle studies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network for signal modelling in business cycle studies","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00400232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042658S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","citationCount":"1","articleId":"400232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":400235,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Chao","affiliation":["Institute of AI & Robotics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hu Chao","id":"37087313758"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of AI & Robotics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Nanning Zheng","id":"37087164183"},{"name":"Gao Yan","affiliation":["Institute of AI & Robotics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Gao Yan","id":"37087475361"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2129-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"400235","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400235","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Stability analysis","Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Cities and towns","Artificial intelligence","Optimization methods","Traveling salesman problems","Parallel processing","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["travelling salesman problems","operations research","combinatorial mathematics","optimisation","Hopfield neural nets","stability","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuron design","stability analysis","neural network","TSP","travelling salesman problem","instability","Hopfield neural network","combinational optimization","progressive algorithm","complete negative connection","system moving trajectory","activation function modification","computational energy function","rapid convergence","local minimum","maximum gradient direction","simulated annealing like method","global optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400235","pdfPath":"/iel2/3184/9021/00400235.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2453","endPage":"2458 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuron design and stability analysis of neural network for TSP","abstract":"The factors that result in unstability and local optimization of Hopfield neural network employed by combinational optimization problem are investigated and a progressive algorithm is proposed.

We propose a new error correction procedure based on the theory of error correcting codes and information theory. We assume that the system is composed of J computers, and each computer, N modules, where the word-length of the computer is w bits. Each module has a m bits memory and w bits CPU. We also assume that each computer is loosely coupled to the other computers, while each module is tightly coupled to the other modules in each computer. Then we introduce an (N, K) code over GF(2/sup m/) in each computer, where w=mK. The proposed system is able to construct a (JN, K) code over GF(2/sup m/) by combining J computers which consist of JN modules. If at least one computer detects errors, then the (JN, K) code is decoded to correct errors. Thus the proposed system can increase the error correcting capability and errors which result in only detecting errors or decoding errors for the conventional system can be corrected, where the conventional system is assumed to be the L out of J system. Comparing the proposed system with the conventional system, we show that the performance of the former is superior than that of the latter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4980406","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","displayDocTitle":"A fault tolerant system configuration based on error correcting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault tolerant system configuration based on error correcting codes","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00400238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025426S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"9021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3184","articleId":"400238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":400248,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

The first NN controller is shown to render the closed-loop system globally practically stable while the second NN controller guarantees global uniform asymptotic stability of the system. The new approach ensures stability of the control system without using any learning or adaptive algorithm. Moreover, using nonlinear control theory, the proposed approach to neural networks provides sufficient conditions for determining the number of hidden layers, the dimension of neurons, the architecture of the neural network and the weights among the layers in order to guarantee stability of the system.

To demonstrate MTCMOS's effectiveness, a PLL LSI based on standard cells was designed as a carrying vehicle. 18-MHz operation at 1 V was achieved using a 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.400426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/9026/00400426.pdf","startPage":"847","endPage":"854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.400426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1-V power supply high-speed digital circuit technology with multithreshold-voltage CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"1-V power supply high-speed digital circuit technology with multithreshold-voltage CMOS","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5041121","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1-V power supply high-speed digital circuit technology with multithreshold-voltage CMOS","sourcePdf":"00400426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038184S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"695","articleId":"400426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":400428,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper is an extension of Sakurai's work (1990) on delay modeling of inverters for fast input ramps. We observed that two different mechanisms, that can be adequately modeled analytically, govern the delay and the output transition-time of an inverter in two extreme cases: infinitely fast and infinitely slow inputs. These extreme points are joined by a curve that can predict the delay and the output transition-time for any input. We found that the delay and the output transition-time for an inverter with small fanouts are similar to those for large input transition-times. This behavior is explained by the use of I-V trajectories. We describe a method to generate parameters to model delay and output transition-time for different fanouts and input transition-times; this method can be generalized to add parameters for different temperatures and supply voltages. Given a new process technology and its corresponding SPICE-model parameters, our delay calculation scheme comprises characterizing a minimal number of coefficients for each new technology (a one-time process) and evaluating the analytical forms thereafter to obtain the delay and the transition-time. Our delay equations also explain negative delays that arise in case of slow input rise-times. A program incorporating the above idea has been implemented in C. Delay and transition-time values obtained from the program have been found to be typically within 3% of SPICE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/9026/00400428.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.400428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.400428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive delay model for CMOS inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Semiconductor device modeling","Inverters","Temperature","Voltage","Equations","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic gates","CMOS logic circuits","delays","integrated circuit modelling","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay model","CMOS inverters","output transition-time","input ramp","fanouts","I-V trajectories","SPICE model","process technology","computer program","C language"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive delay model for CMOS inverters","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5041123","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive delay model for CMOS inverters","sourcePdf":"00400428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076201S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"78","articleId":"400428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":400431,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Circuits and Systems Laboratory Institute of Electronics and Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Yu Wu","id":"37276423000"},{"name":"Chin-Fong Chiu","affiliation":["Circuits and Systems Laboratory Institute of Electronics and Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Fong Chiu","id":"37348347200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"400431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":199},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Retina","Phototransistors","CMOS technology","Image edge detection","BiCMOS integrated circuits","CMOS process","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phototransistors","image sensors","computer vision","silicon","object detection","edge detection","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertebrate retina","bipolar phototransistors","BiCMOS technology","CMOS technology","N-well CMOS process","edge extraction","digital image processing","moving object detection","2D array","silicon retina cells","image sensors","0.8 micron","Si"]}],"abstract":"A new silicon retina is proposed to realize the functions of the vertebrate retina. In the proposed silicon retina, each basic cell consists of two separated bipolar phototransistors only. The smooth function of the horizontal cell in the vertebrate retina is efficiently achieved by the diffusion and redistribution of the photogenerated excess carriers in the common base region of the phototransistors. Thus, the structure of the new silicon retina is very simple and compact. It can be easily implemented in both CMOS and BiCMOS technologies with a small chip area. A 2-D array of 32*32 new silicon retina cells has been designed and fabricated in 0.8 /spl mu/m N-well CMOS process.

An electronic synapse cell has been constructed with six transistors by merging a floating-gate EEPROM memory cell into a new-concept /spl upsi/MOS differential-source-follower circuitry. The synapse can represent both positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) weights under single V/sub DD/ power supply and is free from standby power dissipation. An excellent linearity in the weight updating characteristics of the synapse memory has been also established by employing a simple self-feedback regime in each cell circuitry, thus making it fully compatible to the on-chip self-learning architecture of /spl upsi/MOS neural networks.

The field of warfare modeling and simulation (M&S) is quite large, however, and this paper reviews its evolution and how DIS fits within it. A few things are clear. First, DIS is exceedingly valuable for training. Second, DIS could be a powerful means for improving the quality of planning and analysis if used wisely for occasional well designed experiments. These could 1) provide insights about real-world processes involving human performance and behavior (including decision making), 2) help inform and calibrate models, and 3) help test plans in a quasioperational environment. Third, distributed war gaming, which depends on DIS technology, is already lowering boundaries among developers, planners, and warfighters. This can shorten development processes and improve the results through virtual prototyping; it can also improve operational readiness. To achieve these potential benefits, however, will require a holistic approach, conceptual breakthroughs, and profoundly difficult model development efforts. The challenges include developing integrated hierarchies of models, developing adaptive decision models and other models of human behavior, developing and using new forms of uncertainty-sensitive analysis, and learning how to use DIS experiments effectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.400454","startPage":"1138","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/9027/00400454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.400454","endPage":"1155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed interactive simulation in the evolution of DoD warfare modeling and simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Distributed interactive simulation in the evolution of DoD warfare modeling and simulation","volume":"83","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5037340","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed interactive simulation in the evolution of DoD warfare modeling and simulation","sourcePdf":"00400454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0588S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","articleId":"400454","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":400469,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As in the photometric stereo approach, here also the observation that there is a one-to-one mapping between the n-tuples of the photometric stereo image intensities and the orientations of the surface normals is valid. A multilayered feedforward neural network with backpropagation training algorithm is used as dimensionality reducer to effectively encode this mapping by associating the two components of surface normals to the observed intensities from three photometric stereo images of the underlying surface patches. The training patterns are sampled from the images of a Gaussian sphere of average reflectance containing both diffuse and specular components. The neural network thus trained has been tested on images of real-world objects with different shapes and reflectance properties. Using the surface normals estimated by the neural network, 3-D shapes of the objects have been reconstructed to a good approximation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.400507","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/9029/00400507.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1300","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.400507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to photometric stereo inversion of real-world reflectance maps for extracting 3-D shapes of objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to photometric stereo inversion of real-world reflectance maps for extracting 3-D shapes of objects","volume":"25","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5029595","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to photometric stereo inversion of real-world reflectance maps for extracting 3-D shapes of objects","sourcePdf":"00400507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04434S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"2","articleId":"400507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":400564,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Zhu","affiliation":["James River Corporation, Easton, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Pengfei Zhu","id":"37654022000"},{"name":"P.M.

The algorithm eliminates the problems arising from curvature approximation and Gaussian filtering in the existing algorithms. Based on the definition of \"critical level,\" we establish a set of criteria for the design of an effective CPD algorithm for the first time. By quantifying the critical level to the modified area confined by three consecutive \"pseudocritical points,\" a simple but very effective algorithm is developed. The comparison of our experimental results with those of many other CPD algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm is superior in that it provides a sequence of figures at every detail level, and each has a smaller integral error than the others with the same number of critical points. The experimental results on shapes with various complexities also show the algorithm is reliable and robust with regard to noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.400564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/9031/00400564.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.400564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On critical point detection of digital shapes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"On critical point detection of digital shapes","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5024396","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On critical point detection of digital shapes","sourcePdf":"00400564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030828S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"79","articleId":"400564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":400565,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

The model is assumed to be of known color distribution, which permits the use color-space processing. A new method is presented, which exploits more information than the previous backprojection algorithm of Swain and Ballard (1990) at a competitive complexity. Precisely, the new algorithm is based on matching local histograms with the model, instead of directly replacing pixels with a confidence that they belong to the object. We prove that a simple version of this algorithm degenerates into backprojection in the worst case. In addition, we show how to estimate the scale of the model. Results are shown on pictures digitized from the famous \"Where is Waldo\" books. Issues concerning the optimal choice of a color space and its quantization are carefully considered and studied in this application. We also propose to use co-occurrence histograms to deal with cases where important color variations can be expected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.400571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/9031/00400571.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.400571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Waldo, or focus of attention using local color information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Finding Waldo, or focus of attention using local color information","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5024401","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Waldo, or focus of attention using local color information","sourcePdf":"00400571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026132S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"60","articleId":"400571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":400572,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The registration task involves finding the translation and rotation parameters which properly align overlapping views of the object so as to reconstruct from these partial surfaces, an integrated surface representation of the object. The registration task is expressed as an optimization problem. We define a function which measures the quality of the alignment between the partial surfaces contained in two range images as produced by a set of motion parameters. This function computes a sum of Euclidean distances from control points on one surfaces to corresponding points on the other. The strength of this approach is in the method used to determine point correspondences. It reverses the rangefinder calibration process, resulting in equations which can be used to directly compute the location of a point in a range image corresponding to an arbitrary point in 3D space. A stochastic optimization technique, very fast simulated reannealing (VFSR), is used to minimize the cost function. Dual-view registration experiments yielded excellent results in very reasonable time. A multiview registration experiment took a long time. A complete surface model was then constructed from the integration of multiple partial views. The effectiveness with which registration of range images can be accomplished makes this method attractive for many practical applications where surface models of 3D objects must be constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5024404","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Registering multiview range data to create 3D computer objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Registering multiview range data to create 3D computer objects","sourcePdf":"00400574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026637S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"251","articleId":"400574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":400575,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This paper describes the design and implementation of a linear systolic array chip for computing the edit distance between two strings over a given alphabet. An encoding scheme is proposed which reduces the number of bits required to represent a state in the computation. The architecture is a parallel realization of the standard dynamic programming algorithm proposed by Wagner and Fischer (1974), and can perform approximate string matching for variable edit costs. More importantly, the architecture does not place any constraint on the lengths of the strings that can be compared. It makes use of simple basic cells and requires regular nearest neighbor communication, which makes it suitable for VLSI implementation. A prototype of this array has been built at the University of South Florida.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.400575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/9031/00400575.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.400575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CASM: a VLSI chip for approximate string matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400575/","displayDocTitle":"CASM: a VLSI chip for approximate string matching","volume":"17","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5024405","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CASM: a VLSI chip for approximate string matching","sourcePdf":"00400575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046204S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"26","articleId":"400575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":400639,"authors":[{"name":"W.

First, we prove fundamental, similarly behaving lower and upper bounds, and give an approximation based on the bounds, which is effective for analyzing ATM multiplexers, even when the traffic has many, possibly heterogeneous, sources and their models are of high dimension. Second, we apply our analytic approximation to statistical models of video teleconference traffic, obtain the multiplexing system's capacity as determined by the number of admissible sources for given cell-loss probability, buffer size and trunk bandwidth, and, finally, compare with results from simulations, which are driven by actual data from coders. The results are surprisingly close. Our bounds are based on large deviations theory. The main assumption is that the sources are Markovian and time-reversible. Our approximation to the steady-state buffer distribution is called Chenoff-dominant eigenvalue since one parameter is obtained from Chernoffs theorem and the other is the system's dominant eigenvalue. Fast, effective techniques are given for their computation. In our application we process the output of variable bit rate coders to obtain DAR(1) source models which, while of high dimension, require only knowledge of the mean, variance, and correlation. We require cell-loss probability not to exceed 10/sup -6/, trunk bandwidth ranges from 45 to 150 Mb/s, buffer sizes are such that maximum delays range from 1 to 60 ms, and the number of coder-sources ranges from 15 to 150. Even for the largest systems, the time for analysis is a fraction of a second, while each simulation takes many hours. Thus, the real-time administration of admission control based on our analytic techniques is feasible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.400656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9034/00400656.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.400656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental bounds and approximations for ATM multiplexers with applications to video teleconferencing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental bounds and approximations for ATM multiplexers with applications to video teleconferencing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400656/","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5029196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental bounds and approximations for ATM multiplexers with applications to video teleconferencing","sourcePdf":"00400656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082927S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"107","articleId":"400656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":400660,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The concept of a service curve is used to partially characterize the service that virtual circuit connections receive. We find that service curves provide a convenient framework for managing the allocation of performance guarantees. In particular, bounds on end-to-end performance measures can be simply obtained in terms of service curves and burstiness constraints on arriving traffic. Service curves can be allocated to the connections, and we consider scheduling algorithms that can support the allocated service curves. Such an approach provides the required degree of isolation between the connections in order to support performance guarantees, without precluding statistical multiplexing. Finally, we examine the problem of enforcing burstiness constraints in slot-based networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of service guarantees in virtual circuit switched networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.400660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9034/00400660.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.400660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Quality of service guarantees in virtual circuit switched networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5029200","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of service guarantees in virtual circuit switched networks","sourcePdf":"00400660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040384S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"289","articleId":"400660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":400661,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

IEEE INFOCOM, p. 636-636, 1994) as an easily implementable version of fair queueing. In this paper, the worst case network delay performance of a class of fair queueing algorithms, including the SCFQ scheme, is studied. We build upon and generalize the methodology developed by Parekh and Gallager (see ACM/IEEE Trans. Networking, vol.1, no.3, p.344-357, 1993, and vol.2, no.2, p.137-150, 1994) to study this class of algorithms based on the leaky-bucket characterization of traffic. Under modest resource allocation conditions, the end-to-end session delays and backlogs corresponding to this class of algorithms are shown to be bounded. For the SCFQ scheme, these bounds are larger, but practically as good as the corresponding bounds for the PGPS scheme. It is shown that the SCFQ scheme can provide adequate performance guarantees for the delay-sensitive traffic in ATM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.400661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9034/00400661.pdf","endPage":"1070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network delay analysis of a class of fair queueing algorithms","doi":"10.1109/49.400661","startPage":"1057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Network delay analysis of a class of fair queueing algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400661/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5029201","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network delay analysis of a class of fair queueing algorithms","sourcePdf":"00400661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063979S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"50","articleId":"400661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":400662,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Li Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi-Li Zhang","id":"37279627200"},{"name":"D.

Using the exponentially bounded burstiness (EBB) process model introduced by Yaron and Sidi (see IEEE/ACM Trans.

For a single GPS server in isolation, we present statistical bounds on the distributions of backlog and delay for each session. In the network setting, we show that networks belonging to a broad class of GPS assignments, the so-called consistent relative session treatment (CRST) GPS assignments, are stable in a stochastic sense. In particular, we establish simple bounds on the distribution of backlog and delay for each session in a rate proportional processor sharing (RPPS) GPS network with arbitrary topology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9034/00400662.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.400662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.400662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of the generalized processor sharing scheduling discipline","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Processor scheduling","Global Positioning System","Traffic control","Delay","Network servers","Communication system traffic control","Stochastic processes","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","processor scheduling","telecommunication traffic","computer networks","token networks","delays","stochastic processes","telecommunication control","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","generalized processor sharing","scheduling discipline","session backlog","delay distribution","deterministic study","leaky-bucket token controlled sessions","exponentially bounded burstiness process model","source traffic","statistical bounds","consistent relative session treatment","stochastic stability","rate proportional processor sharing","network topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of the generalized processor sharing scheduling discipline","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5029202","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of the generalized processor sharing scheduling discipline","sourcePdf":"00400662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076773S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"98","articleId":"400662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":400664,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Shang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Shang Chang","id":"37276902000"},{"name":"J.A.

The system described uses an optical fiber Michelson interferometer with one arm wrapped on a piezoelectric driven stretcher capable of inducing a /spl sim/10 cm fiber length change. Passive polarization compensation is utilized which eliminates the possibility of random polarization fading in the interferometer causing apodization of the interferogram. This permits an all-fiber design without the need for speciality optical fiber or external polarization adjustments. A reference Nd:YAG laser is used to stabilize the interferometric scan in a phase-locked loop configuration by way of slow and fast feedback correction elements. A spectral resolution of <0.07 cm/sup -1/ was obtained, which corresponds to a Bragg wavelength shift of /spl sim/0.015 nm in the 1.55 /spl mu/m region. The simultaneous wavelength determination capacity of the device also permits it to be used in a variety of other applications for analysis of optical spectra.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/9035/00400685.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1295","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.400685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.400685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a fiber Fourier transform spectrometer to the detection of wavelength-encoded signals from Bragg grating sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Spectroscopy","Optical fiber polarization","Optical interferometry","Piezoelectric polarization","Optical fiber sensors","Optical fibers","Laser feedback","Optical feedback","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transform spectrometers","fibre optic sensors","optical signal detection","decoding","Michelson interferometers","light interferometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength-encoded signal detection","Bragg grating sensors","all-fiber Fourier transform spectrometer","decoding","optical fiber Michelson interferometer","piezoelectric driven stretcher","passive polarization compensation","Nd:YAG laser","phase-locked loop","feedback correction elements","spectral resolution","1.55 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of a fiber Fourier transform spectrometer to the detection of wavelength-encoded signals from Bragg grating sensors","volume":"13","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5018134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a fiber Fourier transform spectrometer to the detection of wavelength-encoded signals from Bragg grating sensors","sourcePdf":"00400685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055313S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"70","articleId":"400685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":400704,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

In a material with absorption, it is not possible to completely eliminate the crosstalk by adjusting the coupling length. The coupling length for minimum crosstalk differs from that of lossless systems. Theoretical limits of the lowest achievable crosstalk and the corresponding coupling lengths are calculated. The results show that the effect of absorption on crosstalk is more severe when the devices are designed for low crosstalk. The increase in crosstalk due to absorption can be as high as 20 dB.

An accelerated aging study was performed in order to determine its impact on device performance. The effect of aging was modeled as a second anneal. Both planar waveguides and Y-fed balanced-bridge modulator (YBBM) devices were aged at elevated temperatures. The hydrogen concentration profile of the planar waveguides was measured after aging with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and compared to the profile from a control sample. The YBBM characteristics were measured as a function of aging time as well. Measured activation energies indicate that hydrogen diffusion is the dominant aging mechanism in the YBBM. Extrapolations indicate that device degradation is negligible at temperatures of 95/spl deg/C or below. An operating/storage temperature as high as 125/spl deg/C can be sustained for 13 years with little effect.

The H-component provides four diffracted output beams with /spl sim/11% efficiency for each output, and the required laser power for the clock distribution system is calculated. To provide 80 clock fan-out signals for a five-board system, the clock distribution system requires 4.7 mW of laser power with 10 /spl mu/W of received optical power at each node. The misalignment analysis for the free-space optical system is presented and design considerations are given. The factors causing clock skew and timing jitter in the optical clock distribution system are also examined. An experimental system was demonstrated with a 622-MHz clock signal distributed with 36 ps of timing jitter and less than 10 ps of clock skew.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9035","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/9035/00400725.pdf","doi":"10.1109/50.400725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.400725","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Board level H-tree optical clock distribution with substrate mode holograms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400725/","displayDocTitle":"Board level H-tree optical clock distribution with substrate mode holograms","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5024141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Board level H-tree optical clock distribution with substrate mode holograms","sourcePdf":"00400725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057599S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","articleId":"400725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":400726,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Highly-dense WDM is assumed. The optical layer is superimposed to an electrical network layer in which the high capacity streams are processed at lower digital transmission hierarchies. Photonic switching is realized inside the optical layer by means of wavelength translators based on four-wave-mixing in traveling wave semiconductor optical amplifiers. The transmission performance of the network is theoretically analyzed exploiting an accurate model of the wavelength converter. ASE and phase noise accumulation along the signal path through the network, linear crosstalk and nonlinear effects during fiber propagation are taken into account. Due to the adopted method to perform wavelength conversion, chirping/dispersion induced penalties result to be greatly reduced and homo-wavelength crosstalk inside the network nodes is almost eliminated. This allows very good transmission performances to be attained even for very high capacity networks, as demonstrated by the reported theoretical results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WDM networks","Optical wavelength conversion","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Optical crosstalk","Optical fiber networks","Stimulated emission","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical noise","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear optics","photonic switching systems","optical fibre networks","multiwave mixing","semiconductor lasers","modelling","phase noise","optical crosstalk","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","wavelength-switched high-density WDM networks","four-wave-mixing","semiconductor optical amplifiers","wavelength conversion","optical transparent network layer","very high capacity data streams","highly-dense WDM","electrical network layer","high capacity streams","lower digital transmission hierarchies","photonic switching","wavelength translators","traveling wave semiconductor optical amplifiers","phase noise accumulation","ASE accumulation","signal path","linear crosstalk","nonlinear effects","fiber propagation","dispersion induced penalties","chirping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.400726","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/9035/00400726.pdf","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.400726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of wavelength-switched high-density WDM networks employing wavelength conversion by four-wave-mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of wavelength-switched high-density WDM networks employing wavelength conversion by four-wave-mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400726/","volume":"13","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5024142","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of wavelength-switched high-density WDM networks employing wavelength conversion by four-wave-mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00400726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051545S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","articleId":"400726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":400734,"authors":[{"name":"L.K.

Three phase load flow analysis is used to calculate the current flows of line switches by retrieving the network topology and facility attributes which have been stored in the AM/FM database. The current flows solved are then stored in the database as the attributes of line switches for load transfer analysis. When a system contingency such as a fault or overload occurs, the load transfer is then executed to find the switches to be operated by the heuristic search method while subjected to the system operation rules. By the proposed method, the network topology can be easily updated and displayed in the computers by the connectivity trace routine according to the switching operations. Since all the system facilities are stored in the AM/FM database according to the actual spatial coordinates, it provides practical information for the system operators and crews to allocate and operate the switches easily. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated AM/FM system with application programs for distribution operation, a distribution system of Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) in Kaohsiung downtown area is selected for case study. It is found that contingency load transfer for distribution system operation can be enhanced significantly with the application of AM/FM systems to determine the switches to be operated and the corresponding spatial locations of the switches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.400818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.400818","endPage":"1135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9038/00400818.pdf","startPage":"1126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of AM/FM system to distribution contingency load transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400818/","displayDocTitle":"The application of AM/FM system to distribution contingency load transfer","volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4954067","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of AM/FM system to distribution contingency load transfer","sourcePdf":"00400818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046145S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"14","articleId":"400818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":400827,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The particle sizes examined include 1.0, 4.5, 13, 17 and 75 /spl mu/m. The optimum size to give the lowest leakage current and the longest time to failure of the coating is determined. The particle size affects the roughness of the coating. This is determined by a high resolution surface roughness tester and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination. The roughness is enhanced after prolonged testing in salt-fog. The leakage current affects the amount of silicone fluid on the surface. The amount of silicone fluid present on the surface after exposure to dry-band arcing in salt-fog is a function of the particle size.

Encouraging results are shown and indicate that this approach can be used for supporting a new generation of very high speed protective relaying systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4954057","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach to fault classification for high speed protective relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach to fault classification for high speed protective relaying","sourcePdf":"00400828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038183S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"192","articleId":"400828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":400858,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

The studies have indicated that the design shows promise and that the fundamental frequency switching of the GTO thyristors is superior to various forms of pulse-width modulation. The main advantages of the multilevel STATCON over other types of STATCON is that each individual GTO thyristor is clamped to a DC voltage and can be switched independently. Hence a staircase type of output voltage can be used to reduce the harmonics, the filtering requirements and the switching losses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.400858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9038/00400858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.400858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9038","startPage":"732","endPage":"738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced static compensation using a multilevel GTO thyristor inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced static compensation using a multilevel GTO thyristor inverter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4954027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced static compensation using a multilevel GTO thyristor inverter","sourcePdf":"00400858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029179S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"102","articleId":"400858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":400862,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

First, three mathematical performance indices are introduced to be able to compare filters on the same basis. Then the concept of the FIR type of digital mimic filter is described. It is shown that, for filters exhibiting a null response at frequency zero on their frequency response, the addition of a digital mimic circuit, tuned to the middle of the range of time constants to be suppressed, will almost completely eliminate the effect of an exponentially decaying component. Moreover, this is possible without sacrificing the original response speed, although it increases susceptibility to noisy components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.400869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9038/00400869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.400869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9038","startPage":"621","endPage":"630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Removal of DC-offset in current waveforms using digital mimic filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Removal of DC-offset in current waveforms using digital mimic filtering","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4954016","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Removal of DC-offset in current waveforms using digital mimic filtering","sourcePdf":"00400869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028479S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"9038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"214","articleId":"400869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":400877,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In order to prevent the distance protection from tripping during such conditions, a power swing blocking device is often utilized. Conventional power swing blocking devices cannot cope with very fast power swings of up to 5 Hz/sec. This paper presents a new power swing blocking principle that has the ability to immediately clear the block when a fault occurs within the relay trip zone. This is demonstrated for extremely fast swings (greater than 5 Hz/sec) and even for two phase operation (during single pole tripping). This new principle is in a form which can be implemented on an existing digital distance protection relay. Results are presented based on extensive simulation studies carried out on a typical 400 kV system, using the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) software.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.400902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9039/00400902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.400902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9039","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new blocking principle with phase and earth fault detection during fast power swings for distance protection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new blocking principle with phase and earth fault detection during fast power swings for distance protection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5024902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new blocking principle with phase and earth fault detection during fast power swings for distance protection","sourcePdf":"00400902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032358S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"89","articleId":"400902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":400914,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

The power line conditioner aims at a general filtering system which will be installed at the point of common coupling in a power system feeding harmonic-sensitive loads and unidentified harmonic-producing loads. One of the two active filters is connected in series with the supply, while another is in series with the shunt passive filter. The purpose of the power line conditioner is to reduce voltage distortion at the connection point, and is to eliminate harmonic currents escaping into the system upstream of the connection point. A control scheme of the two series active filters which play an important role is described in this paper. Its filtering characteristics are discussed with the focus on voltage and current distortion. A prototype model of 20 kVA is constructed to verify the functionality and performance of the power line conditioner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new power line conditioner for harmonic compensation in power systems","doi":"10.1109/61.400941","endPage":"1575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/9039/00400941.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.400941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=400941","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Active filters","Passive filters","Voltage","Thyristors","Impedance","Filtering","Frequency","Pulse width modulation inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system harmonics","compensation","active filters","passive filters","harmonic distortion","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line conditioner","harmonic compensation","power systems","series active filters","shunt passive filter","filtering system","point of common coupling","harmonic-sensitive loads","unidentified harmonic-producing loads","voltage distortion reduction","control scheme","20 kVA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new power line conditioner for harmonic compensation in power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/400941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5024941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new power line conditioner for harmonic compensation in power systems","sourcePdf":"00400941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030913S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"150","articleId":"400941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":400945,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The results of bit fail pattern count analyses are used both for fault analysis post-processing and manufacturing yield improvement methodologies. The move toward neural network implementation comes in response to prohibitively long processing times required for implementation of rule-based algorithms on more complex devices and the added flexibility of a neural network to learn new fail types in a more adaptive mode. An unsupervised approach to fail pattern identification was implemented on a 128 K SRAM chip using a two-layer Kohonen Self Organizing Map for identification and concurrence of bit fail pattern categories within SRAM chips. A second network utilized a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture with backpropagation of error for prediction of the number of occurrences per bitmap of each of the 34 previously identified shape types. The MLP used the output of a SOM as its input vector to assist in the feature extraction by shape type. Both trained networks out-performed existing rule-based algorithms both in ability to identify bit fail pattern types, frequency counts, and speed of processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5036543","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"SRAM bitmap shape recognition and sorting using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM bitmap shape recognition and sorting using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00401009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066505S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"11","articleId":"401009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":401017,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Single-cell and adjacent cell faults, which are dominant, are due to blocked contact holes, aluminum 1 short-circuit defects and blocked via holes. A vector plot showing the relation between single-cell and adjacent-cell failure probabilities suggests that blocked contact holes, aluminum 1 short-circuit defects, and blocked via holes can be isolated.

The Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) system has been used as a wireless communication environment.

Simulation results show that the proposed technique, SB-MSVQ, is very robust to channel fading errors even at a very low channel power, whereas the baseline JPEG suffers from channel fading errors which are visually very annoying. Due to the inherent structure of SB-MSVQ, the important low frequency information of an image is packed into a small portion of the encoded data. If this portion is received intact by the SB-MSVQ decoder, the overall quality degradation of the reconstructed image is marginal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.401103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/9044/00401103.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"253","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00401103.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.401103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband coding with multistage VQ for wireless image communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401103/","displayDocTitle":"Subband coding with multistage VQ for wireless image communication","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5037076","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband coding with multistage VQ for wireless image communication","sourcePdf":"00401103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033037S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"9044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"13","articleId":"401103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":401104,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is shown that the optimum KLT significantly outperforms the well known shape-adaptive DCT method introduced by Gilge et al. (1989) for coding Segments of arbitrary shape in intraframe coding mode. A statistical transform gain close to the Gilge-method can be achieved with a shape-adaptive DCT algorithm introduced by Sikora and Makai (see Proc. Workshop Image Anal.

The role of a target's coherent SAR signature, which varies with the radar's frequency and aspect angle, in forming the Fourier space of the SAR signal is analyzed. The resultant relationship is the basis of an algorithm which, after extracting (digital spotlighting) the target's coherent SAR signature in the reconstruction domain, could be used to differentiate man-made structures from foliage. Methods for blind-velocity moving target indication are discussed. The main tool of the work is a signal theory based analysis of SAR signal via Fourier transform. However, the theory is at most as good as the collected SAR data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","volume":"12","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5030982","publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reconnaissance with ultra wideband UHF synthetic aperture radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconnaissance with ultra wideband UHF synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00401121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069115S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9045","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"87","articleId":"401121","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":401145,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results are applicable to both symmetric and nonsymmetric interconnection matrices and allow for the consideration of all continuous nondecreasing neuron activation functions. Such functions may be unbounded (but not necessarily surjective), may have infinite intervals with zero slope as in a piece-wise-linear model, or both. The conditions on GAS rely on the concept of Lyapunov Diagonally Stable (or Lyapunov Diagonally Semi-Stable) matrices and are proved by employing a class of Lyapunov functions of the generalized Lur'e-Postnikov type. Several classes of interconnection matrices of applicative interest are shown to satisfy our conditions for GAS. In particular, the results are applied to analyze GAS for the class of neural circuits introduced for solving linear and quadratic programming problems. In this application, the principal result here obtained is that these networks are GAS also when the constraint amplifiers are dynamical, as it happens in any practical implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.401145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/9046/00401145.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.401145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9046","startPage":"354","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New conditions for global stability of neural networks with application to linear and quadratic programming problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New conditions for global stability of neural networks with application to linear and quadratic programming problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401145/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5025902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New conditions for global stability of neural networks with application to linear and quadratic programming problems","sourcePdf":"00401145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044861S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"606","articleId":"401145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":401149,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In comparison with the widely used structure based on the canonic signed digit (CSD) expression of multiplicands, the number of adders required by using our structure is not more than that of the CSD structure for any multiplicand. The contiguous range of integer multiplicands whose corresponding multiplications can be implemented by no more than a given number of adders increases exponentially with the increase of the number of adders allowed. It is shown that the ratio of the largest contiguous integer range of our structure to that of the CSD structure is equal to 10.76 and 64.43, respectively, for using no more than 4 and 5 adders. Our method for replacing multipliers with shifters and adders is applied to the design of multiplierless digital filters. Experimental results show that the normalized peak ripples of the filters designed by our method is decreased by up to 4.2 dB over those obtained by the corresponding design method based on the CSD expression of filter coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.401168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/9047/00401168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.401168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9047","startPage":"453","endPage":"460","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00401168.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum number of adders for implementing a multiplier and its application to the design of multiplierless digital filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum number of adders for implementing a multiplier and its application to the design of multiplierless digital filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5025917","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum number of adders for implementing a multiplier and its application to the design of multiplierless digital filters","sourcePdf":"00401168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033841S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"28","articleId":"401168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":401172,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this correspondence, a generalization of the sliding FFT, which introduces a wide class of orthogonal transforms that can be implemented with the order of N complexity is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.401172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.401172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9047","startPage":"478","endPage":"480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/9047/00401172.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401172","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Robustness","Discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transforms","Least squares approximation","Computational complexity","Fast Fourier transforms","Discrete transforms","Quantization","Output feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering theory","fast Fourier transforms","computational complexity","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","transform domain adaptive filters","orthogonal transforms","order of N complexity","sliding FFT","radix-2 FFT structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Order of N complexity transform domain adaptive filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5025920","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401172/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order of N complexity transform domain adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"00401172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025477S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"16","articleId":"401172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-27"},{"_id":401179,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The integrated semiconductor waveguide lens focused the amplifier output to a 8 /spl mu/m/spl times/3 /spl mu/m spot, which was measured at output power up to about 0.5 W, corresponding to 2.5 times the diffraction limit The beam propagation method was used to model the integrated amplifier-lens chip, and the calculated focal distances agree with the experiment to within 5%. The integrated lens may be used for output coupling to a single mode fiber with the requirement that the focal point should be positioned on the output facet. Based on BPM simulation, however, the focal point position becomes uncritical if a single mode output waveguide is integrated.

Explicit formulas for the momentum-matrix elements are given. The improvement in the threshold current density of tensile strained quantum-well lasers, as compared with that of the unstrained quantum well, is shown to result from the enhanced momentum matrix. The differential gain and the linewidth enhancement factor are calculated. The theoretical results show a smaller linewidth enhancement factor for compressively and tensile strained quantum wells than that of the unstrained structure, as has been experimentally observed. The temperature behavior of both the radiative component and the Anger component of the threshold current density is shown. Due to a decrease of gain and differential gain with increasing temperature, the threshold carrier density in unstrained quantum wells is increased with a large increment of the Auger recombination current at high temperature. For strained quantum wells, this increment is moderate because of the smaller threshold carrier density.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5012072","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of strained quantum-well lasers with spin-orbit coupling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of strained quantum-well lasers with spin-orbit coupling","sourcePdf":"00401200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058454S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"9048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"122","articleId":"401200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":401232,"authors":[{"name":"K.

By using fiber birefringence advantageously in conjunction with a wave plate and a polarizer, simultaneous pulse compression and pulse reshaping is realized and this can eliminate the pedestal component inherently associated with this compression technique. A train of 185-fs high-quality pedestal-free pulses, which are the shortest pulses ever achieved using semiconductor lasers, has been successfully generated. The detrimental effect of higher order dispersion on compression and its dependence on group velocity dispersion is also investigated. The results show that it is possible to minimize this effect by using fibers with an appropriate value of dispersion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2944/9048/00401246.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/2944.401246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.401246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond pulse generation from semiconductor lasers using the soliton-effect compression technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse generation","Semiconductor lasers","Optical pulse generation","Dispersion","Fiber lasers","Pulse compression methods","Optical pulse compression","Optical fiber polarization","Solitons","Birefringence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","optical pulse compression","high-speed optical techniques","optical solitons","distributed feedback lasers","laser feedback","optical fibre couplers","birefringence","laser beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","soliton-effect compression technique","femtosecond pulse generation","soliton effect","pulse compression technique","fiber birefringence","wave plate","polarizer","pulse compression","pulse reshaping","pedestal component","high-quality pedestal-free pulses","higher order dispersion","group velocity dispersion","185 fs","1.55 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond pulse generation from semiconductor lasers using the soliton-effect compression technique","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5012118","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond pulse generation from semiconductor lasers using the soliton-effect compression technique","sourcePdf":"00401246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063143S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"9048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"34","articleId":"401246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":401249,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The novel passive antiguide region surrounding the active region is demonstrated to be a highly effective transverse mode and polarization mode selection mechanism. A stable single fundamental mode at high currents has been achieved experimentally for laser aperture as large as 16 /spl mu/m diameter, In addition, very low threshold current of 0.8 mA and current density of 490 A/cm/sup 2/ are achieved with 8 and 32 /spl mu/m diameter VCSEL's, respectively. A detailed numerical two- and three-dimensionaI analysis was performed using the beam propagation method. The modal losses were calculated as a function of the cladding refractive index and the laser size. Quantitative results leading to approximate formulae have been achieved. The high mode selectivity obtained from the numerical analysis is in good agreement with the experimental results we have achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1995","volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5012123","publicationDate":"June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single-mode, passive antiguide vertical cavity surface emitting laser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-mode, passive antiguide vertical cavity surface emitting laser","sourcePdf":"00401251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043932S","chronDate":"Jun 1995","isNumber":"9048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"42","articleId":"401251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":401252,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Resonant acoustic cavities are created inside the transducer while keeping a global unidirectionality required for low loss. As a result, some areas of the transducer are locally backward directional. SAW filters utilizing the RSPUDT exhibit improved filter characteristics (e.g. passband ripple, shape factor) and result in more compact filters. Two kinds of RSPUDT elementary cells were developed.

This method has been adopted for the design of pulse compression filters with low time-bandwidth products. In the bandpass filter design, the sidelobe level in the frequency domain is optimized for a fixed impulse response length. In case of the design of a low time-bandwidth product filters, we optimize the sidelobe suppression in the time domain for a fixed overall bandwidth. We get the optimum time response for a given frequency bandwidth and width of the compressed pulse. The spurious time response is minimized. The corresponding optimum frequency response is split up onto expander and compressor, each consisting of two chirped and apodized IDTs. As an example, an expander-compressor pair at 350 MHz with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 11 MHz, an overall bandwidth of approximately 33 MHz, and a chirp time of 1.0 \u03bcs was designed. The sidelobe suppression in the design is better than 40 dB. The measured filters exhibit a sidelobe level close to -40 dB.

One of the paths contains a correlator, while the other path contains a one data bit delay element and another correlator. The outputs of both paths are then fed to a noncoherent data demodulator. This paper combines both the delay element and the two correlators in a single SAW device, and therefore a better temperature tracking mechanism, simplicity, as well as the elimination of the broadband SAW delay line are achieved. The SAW structure contains a broadband SAW transducer, and two serially coded Pseudo Noise (PN) DPSK filters. The SAW based correlator was built on lithium tantalate.

The first algorithm involves the use a Lanczos eigensolver, while the second algorithm uses a Rayleigh quotient iteration scheme. In both solution methods, schemes are implemented to reduce storage requirements and solution time. Also, both solution methods seek to preserve the sparsity structure of the stiffness matrix to realize major savings in memory. In the Lanczos solution method, the structural pattern of the consistent mass matrix is exploited to gain savings in both memory and solution time. In the Rayleigh quotient iteration method, an algorithm for generating good initial eigenpairs is employed to improve significantly its overall convergence rate, and convergence stability in the regions of closely spaced eigenvalues and repeated eigenvalues. The initial eigenvectors are obtained by interpolation from a coarse mesh. In order for this iterative method to be effective, an eigenvector of interest in the fine mesh must resemble an eigenvector in the coarse mesh. Hence, the method is effective for finding the set of eigenpairs in the low frequency range, and not in the high frequency range where the eigenvectors of the coarse mesh does not resemble well their counterparts in the fine mesh. Results of example problems are presented to show the savings in solution time and storage requirements of the proposed algorithms when compared with the conventional algorithm which uses static condensation to remove the electric potential degrees of freedom from the piezoelectric eigenvalue problem. The disadvantage of this conventional scheme is that the static condensation destroys the sparsity structure of the stiffness matrix, which leads to major increases in memory and solution time","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1994.401716","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/3188/9055/00401716.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1994.401716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9055","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1062 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for eigenvalue problems in piezoelectric finite element analyses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=401716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for eigenvalue problems in piezoelectric finite element analyses","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1994-Nov. 3 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/401716/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4980462","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for eigenvalue problems in piezoelectric finite element analyses","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"00401716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029389S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1994-Nov. 3 1994","isNumber":"9055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3188","citationCount":"9","articleId":"401716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":401770,"authors":[{"name":"X.

In simulation studies Turnbull et al (1990) have shown that reducing the number of elements of a 2D matrix array down to order 8 keeps resolution and leads still to sufficient contrast. These random arrays are usually obtained by generating a random pattern with the desired numbers of elements. We have investigated main to side lobe levels of random sparse arrays and found substantial differences in side lobe levels in different random patterns containing the same element number. Based on this finding an optimization process has been developed which generates optimized array patterns for a given matrix array and fixed order of reduction using a genetic algorithm.

Arbitrary n-dimensional decision regions are approximated by the union of a finite number of basic shapes. The primary examples introduced in this paper are parallelepipeds. By explicitly parameterizing these shapes, the decision region can be determined by estimating the parameters associated with each shape. A structural random search type algorithm called the genetic algorithm is modified to estimate these parameters. Modifications include the parent selection scheme and a new operator called \"extinction and immigration\". Two complex decision regions are examined in detail: one is a linearly inseparable, nonconvex and disconnected type; and the other is linearly inseparable, nonconvex and connected type. The scheme is highly resilient to misclassification errors. The number of the parameters to be estimated only grows linearly with the dimension of the pattern space for simple version of the scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.1994.401979","startPage":"438","endPage":"445","displayPublicationTitle":"ETFA '94. 1994 IEEE Symposium on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

The limitations of wavelets as an efficient solution technique are discussed, and a comparison is made to other fast algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9060/00402199.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.402199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.402199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9060","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of wavelets for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Engine cylinders","Message-oriented middleware","Electromagnetic radiation","Sparse matrices","Wavelet analysis","Kernel","Discrete wavelet transforms","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","integral equations","sparse matrices","electromagnetic wave scattering","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelets","electromagnetic integral equations","wavelet basis functions","sparse moment-method matrix","fast algorithms","radiation","receiving characteristics","EM wave scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A study of wavelets for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5041141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of wavelets for the solution of electromagnetic integral equations","sourcePdf":"00402199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049648S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"179","articleId":"402199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402202,"authors":[{"name":"Dau-Chyrh Chang","affiliation":["Antenna Section, Chung-Shan Institute of Sciences and Technology, Lungtan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Dau-Chyrh Chang","id":"37276261600"},{"name":"Ming-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Antenna Section, Chung-Shan Institute of Sciences and Technology, Lungtan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Chih Huang","id":"38145736600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"402202","dbTime":"72 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2359},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Reflector antennas","Delay lines","Antenna measurements","Prototypes","Gain","Radar antennas","Antenna feeds","Frequency measurement","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antenna arrays","reflector antenna feeds","focusing","delay lines","antenna radiation patterns","reflector antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-polarization microstrip reflectarray antenna","low cross-polarization","high efficiency","antenna focusing","cross-polarization reduction","planar microstrip reflectarray antenna","square patch","microstrip delay lines","orthogonal feeding points","antenna element","efficiency","X-polarization","Y-polarization","gain bandwidth","radar application","communication system application","50 percent","70 percent"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the study and prototype demonstration of the concepts of antenna focusing, cross-polarization reduction, and multiple-polarization capability of a planar microstrip reflectarray antenna. A square patch with two equal microstrip delay lines connected to its two orthogonal feeding points is used as the antenna element of the planar reflectarray. The length of the delay lines, which varies from patch to patch, is schematically designed to focus the plane wave to the feed point. The measured overall efficiency of the prototype antenna is above 50% in the normal operating band, and in some frequency ranges the efficiency has reached 70%. The experimental patterns show that the measured cross polarization due to special arrangement of the delay lines is quite low at the direction of the main beam. X-polarization and Y-polarization measured data show that the antenna is suitable for multiple-polarization applications (dual linear and dual circular). Surprisingly, the antenna has achieved approximately greater than 7% of gain bandwidth (-3 dB gain drop). These results demonstrate the feasibility of such an antenna for radar and communication system applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.402202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9060/00402202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.402202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9060","startPage":"829","endPage":"834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-polarization microstrip reflectarray antenna with high efficiency and low cross-polarization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-polarization microstrip reflectarray antenna with high efficiency and low cross-polarization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402202/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5041144","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-polarization microstrip reflectarray antenna with high efficiency and low cross-polarization","sourcePdf":"00402202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02366S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"119","articleId":"402202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":402212,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Then, sampled-data H/sub 2/ control problems are formulated and solved, whereby the usefulness of these frequency-domain notions is demonstrated both in the analysis and synthesis aspects of sampled-data systems. For the case of sampled-data systems with hybrid (i.e., both continuous-time and discrete-time) input and output signals, the H/sub 2/-norm defined by a hybrid FR-operator turns out to be slightly different from that defined in previous studies.

A classical problem in adaptive control and communication theory concerns the tracking of the best fit of a given form when the statistics or the parameters change slowly. A major, and yet unresolved, problem has been the choice of the step sizes in the tracking algorithm. An algorithm for adapting the step size using the same system measurements which are used for the tracking was suggested by Benveniste and various examples worked out by Brossier. The numerical results were very encouraging. But proofs were lacking. These proofs are supplied here together with supporting numerical data. The proofs are based on recent results in stochastic approximation. The adaptive step-size technique works very well indeed. Much supporting analysis is presented, particularly concerning the interpretation of certain stationary processes as \"stationary\" pathwise derivatives. Finite difference forms are also treated. These are mathematically simpler and can be applied to a wide variety of systems, even when the system is not well modeled. The data shows that they work well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.402231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/9061/00402231.pdf","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.402231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of adaptive step-size SA algorithms for parameter tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402231/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of adaptive step-size SA algorithms for parameter tracking","volume":"40","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5046886","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of adaptive step-size SA algorithms for parameter tracking","sourcePdf":"00402231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101206S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"92","articleId":"402231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":402242,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

Recent work, however, indicates that, for inductive band-pass filters, higher order-mode excitation can be usefully exploited for the purpose of creating transmission zeros. In this paper we describe a new cavity configuration that can be used to introduce transmission zeros in the electrical performance of microwave filters based on thick inductive windows in rectangular waveguides using the higher order-mode interactions. One transmission zero per filter cavity can be introduced and its frequency location can be easily controlled adjusting suitable geometrical parameters. The basic principle is discussed in detail and a computer aided design procedure is also presented. Finally, several application examples are included indicating how the new cavity design can indeed be used to improve the performance of this class of filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.402281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9062/00402281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.402281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9062","startPage":"1911","endPage":"1915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing transmission zeros in inductive-window bandpass filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementing transmission zeros in inductive-window bandpass filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5046954","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing transmission zeros in inductive-window bandpass filters","sourcePdf":"00402281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044032S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"402281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":402284,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Three estimation schemes are formulated according to the representation of the disturbance torque and the processing of the observer states. In addition to the disturbance torque, all the schemes deliver an estimation of the motor speed. Steady-state accuracy and dynamics of the schemes are first determined in nominal conditions, identifying the scheme with the best performance. The effects of variations in the motor parameters are then analyzed, with the finding that a proper modeling of the motor makes the steady-state estimation of the disturbance torque insensitive to any variation. As a test, the schemes are applied to a sensorless DC motor drive for both compensating for the disturbance torque and closing the speed loop. The responses obtained with the best-performance scheme are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.402473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"351","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/9065/00402473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.402473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance torque estimation in a sensorless DC drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Drives","DC motors","Regulators","Voltage","Observers","Steady-state","Testing","Laboratories","Yield estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC motor drives","machine control","velocity control","torque control","parameter estimation","observers","machine theory","control system analysis","closed loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless DC motor drive","disturbance torque estimation","classical observer theory","accuracy","dynamics","performance","steady-state estimation","closed loop speed control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance torque estimation in a sensorless DC drive","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5023668","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402473/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance torque estimation in a sensorless DC drive","sourcePdf":"00402473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049834S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"68","articleId":"402473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402476,"authors":[{"name":"H.

From the investigation, three regions of operating speed are identified, based on limiting quantities which determine the maximum obtainable torque. In each of these regions a different control strategy must be applied. When maximum torque is not required, efficiency can be optimized but this strategy should not be applied at low torque levels when good dynamic performance is required. The second part illustrates how a modified rotor flux oriented control strategy is applied to achieve full utilization of the torque capability over the whole speed range. Several measures for improving dynamic and transient behavior of the drive in the flux weakening region are suggested. Performance of the new control strategy is verified by experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/9065/00402476.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.402476","doi":"10.1109/41.402476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction motors","Rotors","Magnetic flux","Saturation magnetization","Voltage control","Inductance","Stator windings","Induction generators","Power system economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","machine control","torque control","velocity control","control system analysis","rotors","magnetic flux","machine theory","transient analysis","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saturated induction motor","flux weakening","torque capability","torque control","saturated air gap inductance","dynamic performance","rotor flux oriented control","transient behavior","dynamic behavior"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Torque capability and control of a saturated induction motor over a wide range of flux weakening","accessionNumber":"5023671","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque capability and control of a saturated induction motor over a wide range of flux weakening","sourcePdf":"00402476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034416S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"70","articleId":"402476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":402477,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Keun Ji","affiliation":["Department of Control and Instrumentation, Soonchunhyang University, Chungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Keun Ji","id":"37087190860"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37086965531"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"402477","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402477","abstract":"This paper describes the design and the implementation of a self-tuning integral-proportional (IP) speed controller for a rolling mill DC motor drive system, based on a 32-bit floating point digital signal processor (DSP)-TMS 320C30. To get a better transient response than conventional proportional-integral (PI) and/or integral-proportional (IP) speed control in the presence of transient disturbance and/or parameter variations, an adaptive self-tuning IP speed control with load torque feedforward compensation was used. The model parameters, related to motor and load inertia and damping coefficient, were estimated online by using recursive extended least squares (RELS) estimation algorithm. On the basis of the estimated model parameters and a pole-placement design, a control signal was calculated. Digital simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed controller possesses excellent adaptation capability under parameter change and a better transient recovery characteristic than a conventional PI/IP controller under load change.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.402477","startPage":"382","endPage":"386","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/9065/00402477.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.402477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP-based self-tuning IP speed controller with load torque compensation for rolling mill DC drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Signal design","DC motors","Velocity control","Recursive estimation","Control systems","Milling machines","Digital signal processors","Transient response","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rolling mills","DC motor drives","machine control","self-adjusting systems","adaptive control","two-term control","velocity control","compensation","machine theory","machine testing","control system synthesis","transient response","control system analysis computing","electric machine analysis computing","digital simulation","feedforward","digital signal processing chips","least squares approximations","poles and zeros"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-tuning integral-proportional speed control","rolling mill DC motor drive","digital signal processor","transient response","transient disturbance","control design","computer simulation","parameter variations","load torque feedforward compensation","load inertia","damping coefficient","recursive extended least squares estimation algorithm","pole-placement design","model parameters estimation","transient recovery","load change","TMS 320C30","32 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"DSP-based self-tuning IP speed controller with load torque compensation for rolling mill DC drive","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5023672","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP-based self-tuning IP speed controller with load torque compensation for rolling mill DC drive","sourcePdf":"00402477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067299S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"33","articleId":"402477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":402478,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

The problem-space genetic algorithm based datapath synthesis system (PSGA-Synth) combines a standard genetic algorithm with a known heuristic to search the large design space in an intelligent manner. PSGA-Synth handles multicycle functional units, structural pipelining, conditional code and loops, and provides a mechanism to specify lower and upper bounds on the number of control steps. The PSGA-Synth was tested on a set of problems selected from the literature, as well as larger problems created by us, with promising results. PSGA-Synth not only finds the best known results for all the test problems examined in a relatively small amount of CPU time, but also has the ability to efficiently handle large problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5023392","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"8","displayDocTitle":"Datapath synthesis using a problem-space genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Datapath synthesis using a problem-space genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00402494.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03514S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"63","articleId":"402494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402499,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Excessive voltage drops manifest themselves as glitches on the P&G buses and cause erroneous logic signals and degradation in switching speeds. Maximum current estimates are needed at every contact point in the buses to study the severity of the voltage drop problems and to redesign the supply lines accordingly. These currents, however, depend on the specific input patterns that are applied to the circuit. Since it is prohibitively expensive to enumerate all possible input patterns, this problem has, for a long time, remained largely unsolved. In this paper, we propose a pattern-independent, linear time algorithm (iMax) that estimates at every contact point, an upper bound envelope of all possible current waveforms that result by the application of different input patterns to the circuit. The algorithm is extremely efficient and produces good results for most circuits as is demonstrated by experimental results on several benchmark circuits. The accuracy of the algorithm can be further improved by resolving the signal correlations that exist inside a circuit. We also present a novel partial input enumeration (PIE) technique to resolve signal correlations and significantly improve the upper bounds for circuits where the bounds produced by iMax are not tight. We establish with extensive experimental results that these algorithms represent a good time-accuracy trade-off and are applicable to VLSI circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.402499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.402499","endPage":"1012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/9066/00402499.pdf","startPage":"998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern independent maximum current estimation in power and ground buses of CMOS VLSI circuits: Algorithms, signal correlations, and their resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402499/","displayDocTitle":"Pattern independent maximum current estimation in power and ground buses of CMOS VLSI circuits: Algorithms, signal correlations, and their resolution","volume":"14","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5023397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern independent maximum current estimation in power and ground buses of CMOS VLSI circuits: Algorithms, signal correlations, and their resolution","sourcePdf":"00402499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062528S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"110","articleId":"402499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402500,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The new approach, Reciprocal Expansion (REX), is similar to Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) in that it approximates the interconnect by a low-order system. However, unlike AWE, REX expands the reciprocal of the transfer function as a Taylor series. REX has been extended to handle distributed elements directly, compute crosstalk between coupled trees, and account for frequency-dependent effects. Experimental results demonstrate that for critical underdamped interconnects, REX provides better accuracy than AWE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.402500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/9066/00402500.pdf","endPage":"1024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient approximation of the time domain response of lossy coupled transmission line trees","doi":"10.1109/43.402500","startPage":"1013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Efficient approximation of the time domain response of lossy coupled transmission line trees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402500/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5023398","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient approximation of the time domain response of lossy coupled transmission line trees","sourcePdf":"00402500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030485S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"402500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":402511,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

While there are as yet few accepted clinical applications of SQUIDs, various trends are encouraging. The introduction of SQUIDs to the nondestructive testing (NDT) of aircraft and other structural systems and materials is following a similar course: most of the effort is directed towards instrumentation development and demonstrations in simple systems, and instruments suitable for specific commercial applications are just now being prototyped. To assess the potential of either technology, it is useful to ask critical questions: why are we doing this, what have we learned so far, how easy is it, what does it cost, how might we best utilize advances in digital SQUIDs and high-temperature superconductivity, and what can competing technologies provide? Answers to such questions can help identify those specific technological niches for which SQUIDs are uniquely suited, and guide the optimization of SQUID systems that are targeted for particular NDT or biomagnetic measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.402511","startPage":"74","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9067/00402511.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.402511","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SQUID magnetometers for biomagnetism and nondestructive testing: important questions and initial answers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"SQUID magnetometers for biomagnetism and nondestructive testing: important questions and initial answers","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5025505","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","publicationDate":"June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SQUID magnetometers for biomagnetism and nondestructive testing: important questions and initial answers","sourcePdf":"00402511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112975S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"165","articleId":"402511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402513,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

To obtain these merits, the warm and cold dampers should be omitted. However, omission of these dampers deteriorates the stability of the generator operation. In this paper, the authors present a simulation of a fully superconducting and damperless generator (FSDG) behaviour under fault conditions. Knowledge of behaviour under fault conditions is important for design of the superconducting windings of the FSDG. They show a possibility that the superconducting windings, both the armature and field, are quenched in a short circuit fault condition. They also show that excitation control allows the FSDG to stably recover from fault conditions, if the windings are not quenched, and that the current limiting devices to prevent the windings from quenches caused by a fault is necessary for a practical FSDG.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.402592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9067/00402592.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"452","doi":"10.1109/77.402592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability characteristics of fully superconducting and damperless generator with excitation control in fault condition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Stability characteristics of fully superconducting and damperless generator with excitation control in fault condition","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5020298","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability characteristics of fully superconducting and damperless generator with excitation control in fault condition","sourcePdf":"00402592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034142S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"3","articleId":"402592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":402628,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

However, considering the auxiliary facilities such as an outer cryogenic system, these advantages of the superconducting transformer over the conventional transformer are unclear. Thus, in this paper, a comparison of the size, weight and loss of superconducting transformers including auxiliary facilities with those of conventional transformers having the same output volt-ampere capacity is made. From the results of the comparison, the advantages of superconducting transformers are clarified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9067/00402703.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/77.402703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.402703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9067","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=402703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between superconducting and conventional power transformers considering auxiliary facilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformers","Superconducting filaments and wires","Superconducting transmission lines","Cryogenics","Current density","Frequency","Superconducting cables","Shunt (electrical)","Inductors","Multifilamentary superconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superconducting magnets","superconducting coils","power transformers","cryogenics","superconducting cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conventional power transformers","superconducting power transformers","auxiliary facilities","AC superconducting wires","size","weight","loss","outer cryogenic system","output volt-ampere capacity","windings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between superconducting and conventional power transformers considering auxiliary facilities","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5025627","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between superconducting and conventional power transformers considering auxiliary facilities","sourcePdf":"00402703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070063S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"6","articleId":"402703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":402734,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It mainly consists of a copper coil, a superconducting tube, and an iron core which are concentrically arranged. The device is essentially a transformer with the secondary winding being the tube. The tube has diameter of 20 cm, a height of 35 cm, and is made of Bi2212 ceramic, fabricated by partial melting. The ceramic has the voltage current characteristic V-I/sup /spl alpha// with /spl alpha//spl ap/5. The critical current density defined by the 1 /spl mu/V/em criterion is about 1400 A/cm/sup 2/. Depending on the number of turns of the coil, the nominal current of the device was between 130 A and 250 A. In short circuit tests in a 480 V circuit, the prospective fault current of 8 kA was limited to about 5 times the nominal current. The test results are in good agreement with detailed simulations of both the normal operation (e.g. impedance, AC-losses) and the behaviour under fault conditions (i.e. evolution of the current).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.402734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9067","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1062","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9067/00402734.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tests of 100 kW High-T/sub c/ superconducting fault current limiter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/402734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tests of 100 kW High-T/sub c/ superconducting fault current limiter","publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5025657","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tests of 100 kW High-T/sub c/ superconducting fault current limiter","sourcePdf":"00402734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028069S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"87","articleId":"402734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":402739,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Six different etchants were used: citric acid, nitric acid, Br-methanol, EDTA, disodium EDTA, and ion milling. The surface morphologies of the films were examined by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), both before and after etching. The surface resistance (R/sub s/) was measured at 94 GHz using a confocal resonator. An amorphous layer was found on the film surfaces after exposure to air. A few of the etches restored some of the surface crystallinity, but most caused increases in the overall surface roughness. Several of the wet etches attacked dislocations. Ion milling caused the largest degradation of surface crystallinity and a corresponding increase in R/sub s/.

Experimental results show a minimum access time of 380 ps and power dissipation of 9.5 mW. Maximum bit yield of 84% is obtained in minimum magnetic field of about 20 /spl mu/G. We confirm that most of fail bits are caused by trapped magnetic flux, and the RAM functions properly for 98% of the memory cells after measuring fail bit map several times.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1995","accessionNumber":"5030886","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","displayDocTitle":"A 380 ps, 9.5 mW Josephson 4-Kbit RAM operated at a high bit yield","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 380 ps, 9.5 mW Josephson 4-Kbit RAM operated at a high bit yield","sourcePdf":"00403086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040469S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"323","articleId":"403086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":403113,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Yeol Lee","affiliation":["Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Yeol Lee","id":"38140157300"},{"name":"Kwang Yong Kang","affiliation":["Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang Yong Kang","id":"37279668400"},{"name":"Dal Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Soonchunhyang University, Onyang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dal Ahn","id":"37275118300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"403113","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"abstract":"Superconducting YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7-x/ (YBCO) thin films have been grown epitaxially on (100) MgO substrates of laser ablation technique.

In contrast to previous RAMs based on single flux quantization (SFQ), in our system READ and WRITE operations employ ballistic transfer of SFQ pulses along bit lines (either Josephson transmission lines, or passive superconducting microstrip lines, or their combination). The basic memory cells are the single-junction SQUIDs, connected serially by the bit lines and inductively coupled to word lines. READ and WRITE operations are performed by sending SFQ pulses in appropriate directions along bit lines, and DC currents of appropriate polarity into word lines. This approach allows design of very dense memories with n/spl les/2 Josephson junctions per bit, memory cell area smaller than 80 /spl lambda//sup 2/ (where /spl lambda/ is the minimum feature size), and the critical parameter margin well above /spl plusmn/20%.

A throughput of a data exchange between processor elements limits the effective performance of the multi-processor systems. The features of the superconductive ring-pipelined network system are a high-clock-frequency operation by using high-speed Josephson gates and wide band superconductive transmission lines, and a high-density package because of its low power consumption. These advantages significantly reduce pipeline loss and improve flexibility in data exchange. Therefore, this network system is capable of improving the overall effective performance of multiprocessor systems. The prototype chip consists of three Josephson ring interface circuits and superconductive interconnections positioned in between these interface circuits. There are a total 1,130 gates.

Considering the characteristics of various switch architectures, the space-division Banyan type architecture is adopted for a superconducting packet switch proto-type.

We present novel clocking scheme, developed specifically for RSFQ logic, which is based on the concurrent flow of the clock and data signals. The scheme permits the circuit throughput to be independent of inter-cell connection delays and significantly reduces the dependence of the throughput on the clock-to-output delay of the cells. Concurrent flow clocking is particularly well for structured architectures. The simulated maximum clock frequency of an RSFQ decimation digital filter currently under development at the University of Rochester can be as much as seven times higher using concurrent-flow clocking rather than conventional (counterflow) clocking. This advantage, however, is reduced to a factor of two due to fabrication parameter variations in present day superconductive technologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.403302","startPage":"3320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9069/00403302.pdf","endPage":"3324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.403302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403302/","displayDocTitle":"A clock distribution scheme for large RSFQ circuits","volume":"5","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2004","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5048928","publicationDate":"June 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A clock distribution scheme for large RSFQ circuits","sourcePdf":"00403302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132114S","chronDate":"June  1995","isNumber":"9069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"28","articleId":"403302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":403309,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The computational burden associated with these long adaptive filters precludes their use for many low-cost applications. In addition, adaptive filters with many taps may also suffer from slow convergence, especially if the reference signal spectrum has a large dynamic range. Subband techniques have been previously developed for adaptive filters to solve these problems. However, the conventional approach is ruled out for many applications because delay is introduced into the signal path. The paper presents a new type of subband adaptive filter architecture in which the adaptive weights are computed in subbands, but collectively transformed into an equivalent set of wideband filter coefficients. In this manner, signal path delay is avoided while retaining the computational and convergence speed advantages of subband processing. An additional benefit accrues through a significant reduction of aliasing effects. An example of the general technique is presented for a 32-subband design using a polyphase FFT implementation. For this example, the number of multiplies required are only about one-third that of a conventional full band design with zero delay, and only slightly greater than that of a conventional subband design with 16 ms delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.403341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9070/00403341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.403341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9070","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A delayless subband adaptive filter architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=403341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A delayless subband adaptive filter architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5048958","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A delayless subband adaptive filter architecture","sourcePdf":"00403341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045911S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"176","articleId":"403341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":403342,"authors":[{"name":"P.

As the most important performance to this application, the resolution capability of the BSS is roughly assessed by a deterministic measure, borrowed from optics, which takes into account only the influence of the effective aperture of the linear array of sensors. For a linear array operating in a stochastic environment, resolving two incoming signals is essentially a random event, thereby demanding a probabilistic resolution measure. In the paper, the probabilistic performance of the BSS in resolving two incoming signals is studied. The author derives a simple expression, in a closed form, for its failure probability in distinguishing the two signals. The results reveal the way various parameters of signals, noise, and array of sensors affect the resolution performance. Computer simulations are also presented to confirm the validity of the theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","volume":"43","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5048962","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A statistical resolution theory of the beamformer-based spatial spectrum for determining the directions of signals in white noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical resolution theory of the beamformer-based spatial spectrum for determining the directions of signals in white noise","sourcePdf":"00403345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025577S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","articleId":"403345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":403346,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

Arithmetic coding has been used widely in lossless text compression and is known to produce compression ratios that are nearly optimal when the symbol table consists of an ordinary alphabet. In lossless compression of digitized waveform data, however, if each possible sample value is viewed as a \"symbol\" the symbol table would be typically very large and impractical. the authors therefore define a symbol to be a certain range of possible waveform values, rather than a single value, and develop a coding scheme on this basis. The coding scheme consists of two compression stages. The first stage is lossless linear prediction, which removes coherent components from a digitized waveform and produces a residue sequence that is assumed to have a white spectrum and a Gaussian amplitude distribution. The prediction is lossless in the sense that the original digitized waveform can be recovered by processing the residue sequence. The second stage, which is the subject of the present paper, is arithmetic coding used as just described. A formula for selecting ranges of waveform values is provided. Experiments with seismic and speech waveforms that produce near-optimal results are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5048963","volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Arithmetic coding in lossless waveform compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arithmetic coding in lossless waveform compression","sourcePdf":"00403346.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03053S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","articleId":"403346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":403348,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Feng Qian","id":"37382218600"},{"name":"B.D.

The paper proposes adding quadratic constraints to a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) adaptive beamformer to prevent signal cancellation in coherent interference environments. The additional constraint limits the beamformer output mean squared error to be less than a specified level. It is shown that if the quadratic constraint is properly chosen, then the original linearly constrained beamformer's signal cancellation is reduced to an arbitrarily small level while the interference cancellation is unchanged. In practice, the quadratic constraint is constructed based on estimates of the interference parameters. Sensitivity analyses show the performance of the resulting beamformer is robust with respect to this approximate constraint. The effectiveness of the quadratically constrained adaptive beamformer is further illustrated through simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5048965","displayDocTitle":"Quadratically constrained adaptive beamforming for coherent signals and interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratically constrained adaptive beamforming for coherent signals and interference","sourcePdf":"00403348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03296S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","articleId":"403348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":403349,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although regularity is sometimes used in filter evaluation, its success at predicting compression performance is only partial. A more reliable evaluation can be obtained by considering an L-level synthesis/analysis system as a single-input, single-output, linear shift-variant system with a response that varies according to the input location module (2/sup L/,2/sup L/). By characterizing a filter bank according to its impulse response and step response in addition to regularity, we obtain reliable and relevant (for image coding) filter evaluation metrics. Using this approach, we have evaluated all possible reasonably short (less than 36 taps in the synthesis/analysis pair) minimum-order biorthogonal wavelet filter banks. Of this group of over 4300 candidate filter banks, we have selected and present here the filters best suited to image compression.

Specifically, the radial sampling density of both the projections and the reconstructed image decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the ROI. The problem and data are reminiscent of the recently formulated local tomography problem; however, the authors' algorithm reconstructs the ROI of the image itself, not the filtered version of it obtained using local tomography. The new algorithm has the added advantages of speed (it can be implemented entirely using the FFT) and parallelizability (each image harmonic is computed independently). Numerical examples compare the new algorithm to filtered backprojection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Sampling methods","Image reconstruction","Image sampling","Fourier transforms","Cutoff frequency","Geometry","Power harmonic filters","Nonuniform sampling","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image sampling","medical image processing","fast Fourier transforms","filtering theory","harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential radial sampling","region-of-interest tomography","nonuniform sampling","circular harmonic expansions","image reconstruction","image projections","radial sampling density","local tomography problem","FFT","image harmonic","filtered backprojection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/83.403417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9071/00403417.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.403417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-of-interest tomography using exponential radial sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=403417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Region-of-interest tomography using exponential radial sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403417/","volume":"4","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5025889","pubMedId":"18292005","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-of-interest tomography using exponential radial sampling","sourcePdf":"00403417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051177S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"21","articleId":"403417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":403422,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Starting from the definition for operator acting on sets, it is shown how to extend it to operators acting on function. Typically, a connected operator acting on a function is a transformation that enlarges the partition of the space created by the flat zones of the functions. It is shown that from any connected operator acting on sets, one can construct a connected operator for functions (however, it is not the unique way of generating connected operators for functions). Moreover, the concept of pyramid is introduced in a formal way. It is shown that, if a pyramid is based on connected operators, the flat zones of the functions increase with the level of the pyramid. In other words, the flat zones are nested. Filters by reconstruction are defined and their main properties are presented. Finally, some examples of application of connected operators and use of flat zones are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5025894","pubMedId":"18292010","volume":"4","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Flat zones filtering, connected operators, and filters by reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flat zones filtering, connected operators, and filters by reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00403422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053566S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"375","articleId":"403422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":403427,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It has very low transaction costs for micropayments (around 1 cent for a 10 cent item), protects the privacy of the transaction, and is highly scalable. Of special interest is the authors new certified delivery mechanism which delivers information goods if and only if the consumer has paid for them. The article discusses the design of the NetBill protocol and the authors' World Wide Web (WWW) prototype implementation. As the explosive growth of the Internet continues, more people rely on networks for timely information. However, since most information on the Internet today is free, intellectual property owners have little incentive to make valuable information accessible through the network. There are many potential providers who could sell information on the Internet and many potential consumers for that information. What is missing is an electronic commerce mechanism that links the merchants and the consumers. NetBill is a business model, set of protocols, and software implementation allowing consumers to pay owners and retailers of information. While NetBill will enable a market economy in information, it is still expected that there will be an active exchange of free information.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/98.403456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.403456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/9072/00403456.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NetBill: an Internet commerce system optimized for network-delivered services","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"NetBill: an Internet commerce system optimized for network-delivered services","volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5040361","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NetBill: an Internet commerce system optimized for network-delivered services","sourcePdf":"00403456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040952S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"41","articleId":"403456","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":403480,"authors":[{"name":"E.

EVs can be far superior to today's combustion powered vehicles in convenience and cost per passenger mile when they are components of well-integrated urban transportation systems. Current efforts to make EVs emulate combustion powered vehicles are counterproductive because they encourage the continued proliferation of single occupant automobiles as the basis of ground transportation. Use of single occupant vehicles, however powered, is intolerable because of the limited highway and parking capacity, and the associated energy consumption. One highly effective solution to urban transportation problems is to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads by making commercial service in electric vehicles convenient and inexpensive enough to make it the preferred mode of transportation. The author gives a view of transportation in the year 2000 as it can be, given unimpeded access to the highways and roads by the kind of vigorous entrepreneurs who created the basic transportation technologies a hundred years ago.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WESCON.1994.403598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9074","startPage":"41","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of WESCON '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3191/9074/00403598.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Urban electric transportation systems: the role of magnetic power transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Urban electric transportation systems: the role of magnetic power transfer","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4951119","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban electric transportation systems: the role of magnetic power transfer","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00403598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018573S","chronDate":"27-29 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3191","citationCount":"13","articleId":"403598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":403712,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongde Wang","affiliation":["VLSI Research Group, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhongde Wang","id":"37350218200"},{"name":"G.A.

Constraints for column compression with full and half adders are analyzed and, under these constraints, considerable flexibility for implementation of the CC multiplier, including the allocation of adders, and choosing the length of the final fast adder, is exploited. Using the example of an 8/spl times/8 bit CC multiplier, we show that architectures obtained from this new design technique are more area efficient, and have shorter interconnections than the classical Dadda CC multiplier.

The method has been derived by undertaking theoretical investigations of msd first multiply-accumulate algorithms and by deriving important relationships governing the dependencies between circuit latency, levels of pipelining and the range and number representations of filter operands. The techniques described are general and can be applied to both bit parallel and bit serial circuits, including those based on on-line arithmetic. The method is illustrated by applying it to the design of a number of highly pipelined bit parallel IIR and wave digital filter circuits. It is shown that established architectures, which were previously designed using heuristic techniques, can be derived directly from the equations described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.403713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/9076/00403713.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.403713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systematic methodology for the design of high performance recursive digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A systematic methodology for the design of high performance recursive digital filters","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5047116","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic methodology for the design of high performance recursive digital filters","sourcePdf":"00403713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051815S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"18","articleId":"403713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":403715,"authors":[{"name":"Shen-Fu Hsiao","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Information Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shen-Fu Hsiao","id":"37274340300"},{"name":"J.-M.

As matrix sizes increase multiprocessor systems employing traditional CORDIC arithmetic, which operates on two-dimensional (2D) vectors, become unable to achieve sufficient speed. Speed may be increased by expressing the matrix computations in terms of higher dimensional rotations and implementing these rotations using novel CORDIC algorithms-called Householder CORDIC-that extend CORDIC arithmetic to arbitrary dimensions. The method employed to prove the convergence of these multidimensional algorithms differs from the one used in the 2D case. After a discussion of scaling factor decomposition, range extension and numerical errors, VLSI implementations of Householder CORDIC processors are presented and their speed and area are estimated. Finally, some applications of the Householder CORDIC algorithms are listed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.403715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.403715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/9076/00403715.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"1001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Householder CORDIC algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Householder CORDIC algorithms","volume":"44","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047118","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Householder CORDIC algorithms","sourcePdf":"00403715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062082S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"40","articleId":"403715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":403725,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Porter, and early experiments show it to be an effective process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","volume":"21","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5047270","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complexity measure evaluation and selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity measure evaluation and selection","sourcePdf":"00403788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051227S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"29","articleId":"403788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":403789,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

Examples illustrate the use of shape and color information to perform predictive gender and age transformations. The processes we describe begin with the creation of a facial prototype. Generally, a prototype can be defined as a representation containing the consistent attributes across a class of objects. Once we obtain a class prototype, we can take an exemplar that has some information missing and augment it with the prototypical information. In effect, this \"adds in\" the average values for the missing information. We use this notion to transform gray-scale images into full color by including the color information from a relevant prototype. It is also possible to deduce the difference between two groups within a class. Separate prototypes can be formed for each group. These can be used subsequently to define a transformation that will map instances from one group onto the domain of the other. This paper details the procedure we use to transform facial images and shows how it can be used to alter perceived facial attributes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manipulating facial appearance through shape and color","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/38.403830","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/9081/00403830.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.403830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=403830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/403830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Manipulating facial appearance through shape and color","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5045547","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manipulating facial appearance through shape and color","sourcePdf":"00403830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031666S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"220","articleId":"403830","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":403831,"authors":[{"name":"Jintae Lee","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Japan"],"lastName":"Jintae Lee","id":"37087841710"},{"name":"T.L.

This paper focuses on the problem of scheduling queries in RTDBSs. We introduce and evaluate a new algorithm called Priority Adaptation Query Resource Scheduling (PAQRS) for handling both single class and multiclass query workloads. The performance objective of the algorithm is to minimize the number of missed deadlines, while at the same time ensuring that any deadline misses are scattered across the different classes according to an administratively-defined miss distribution. This objective is achieved by dynamically adapting the system's admission, memory allocation, and priority assignment policies according to its current resource configuration and workload characteristics. A series of experiments confirms that PAQRS is very effective for real-time query scheduling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404028/","volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5036821","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass query scheduling in real-time database systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass query scheduling in real-time database systems","sourcePdf":"00404028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056244S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"31","articleId":"404028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":404033,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Matching the inherent visuality of the information stored in such databases, visual specification by example provides an effective and natural way to express content-oriented queries. To support this querying approach, the system must be able to interpret example scenes reproducing the contents of images and sequences to be retrieved, and to match them against the actual contents of the database. In the accomplishment of this task, to avoid a direct access to raw image data, the system must be provided with an appropriate description language supporting the representation of the contents of pictorial data. An original language for the symbolic representation of the contents of image sequences is presented. This language, referred to as spatio-temporal logic, comprises a framework for the qualitative representation of the contents of image sequences, which allows for treatment and operation of content structures at a higher level than pixels or image features. Organization and operation principles of a prototype system exploiting spatio-temporal logic to support querying by example through visual iconic interaction are expounded.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.404033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/9086/00404033.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.404033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbolic description and visual querying of image sequences using spatio-temporal logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic description and visual querying of image sequences using spatio-temporal logic","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5036826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic description and visual querying of image sequences using spatio-temporal logic","sourcePdf":"00404033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064326S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"99","articleId":"404033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":404047,"authors":[{"name":"Chai Wah Wu","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chai Wah Wu","id":"37276424300"},{"name":"L.O.

A typical result states that the array will synchronize if the nonzero eigenvalues of the coupling matrix have real parts that are negative enough. In particular, we show that the intuitive idea that strong enough mutual diffusive coupling will synchronize an array of identical cells is true in general. Sufficient conditions for synchronization for several coupling configurations will be considered. For coupling that leaves the array decoupled at the synchronized state, the cells each follow their natural uncoupled dynamics at the synchronized state. We illustrate this with an array of chaotic oscillators. Extensions of these results to general coupling are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.404047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/9087/00404047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.404047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9087","startPage":"430","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization in an array of linearly coupled dynamical systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization in an array of linearly coupled dynamical systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5062429","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization in an array of linearly coupled dynamical systems","sourcePdf":"00404047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037785S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"717","articleId":"404047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":404048,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A quadritail cell operates as a multiplier core by adding proper combinations of the two input voltages to the individual gates of the four transistors in the core, and also, there are numerous combinations of the two input voltages for a quadritail cell to properly multiply the two input voltages. But all MOS multipliers using a quadritail cell with the proper added combinations of the two input voltages usually possess transfer characteristics equivalent to those of the multiplier proposed by Bult and Wallinga (1986) and by Bult (rediscovered by Wang (1991)). An input system for the MOS multiplier core can, of course, be realized by active devices and also by resistive dividers, if all the added inputs are positive-combinations. The proposed multiplication circuitry is widely useful since it Is operable on low voltage and can be simply implemented with n-channel MOS transistors and resistors in MOS technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5062430","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An MOS four-quadrant analog multiplier based on the multitail technique using a quadritail cell as a multiplier core","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MOS four-quadrant analog multiplier based on the multitail technique using a quadritail cell as a multiplier core","sourcePdf":"00404048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083331S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"24","articleId":"404048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":404062,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

Intuition tells us that if the oscillators are more \"closely connected\" to each other, then they are more likely to synchronize. We discuss how to quantify connectedness in graph-theoretical terms and its relation to algebraic connectivity and show that our results are in accordance with this intuition.

Furthermore, for convenient and efficient design, the results from the numerical model are nondimensionalized and regressed as a polynomial regression model, which describes the relationships between the surface tension forces and the solder joint design parameters explicitly. The regression model is established based on 1100 data points calculated for solder joints with circular pads. We apply this model tool to several design case studies, including the joint array design for self-alignment and the solder assembly of a FLC/VLSI spatial light modulator. It is demonstrated that the model developed here is a very powerful and convenient tool to aid in the design of solder joints for various applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/9089/00404114.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","doi":"10.1109/96.404114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.404114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of solder joints for self-aligned optoelectronic assemblies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soldering","Assembly","Surface tension","Optical modulation","Packaging","Costs","Software tools","Numerical models","Polynomials","Optical arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soldering","integrated optoelectronics","spatial light modulators","packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solder joints","self-aligned optoelectronic assemblies","final alignment accuracy","modeling tool","polynomial regression model","surface tension forces","circular pads","joint array design","spatial light modulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Design of solder joints for self-aligned optoelectronic assemblies","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5033359","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of solder joints for self-aligned optoelectronic assemblies","sourcePdf":"00404114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041517S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"61","articleId":"404114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":404129,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

This has led to intensive research and development efforts for complex PCS (personal communication service) networks. Capacity planning and performance modeling is necessary to maintain a high quality of service to the mobile subscriber while minimizing cost to the PCS provider. The need for flexible analysis tools and the high computational requirements of large PCS network simulations make it an excellent candidate for parallel simulation. Here, we describe our experiences in developing two PCS simulation models on a general purpose distributed simulation platform based on the Time Warp mechanism. These models utilize two widely used approaches to simulating PCS networks: (i) the call-initiated and (ii) the portable-initiated models. We discuss design decisions that were made in mapping these models to the Time Warp executive, and characterize the workloads resulting from these models in terms of factors such as communication locality and computation granularity. We then present performance measurements for their execution on a network of workstations. These measurements indicate that the call-initiated model generally outperforms the portable initiated model, but is not able to capture phenomenon such as the \"busy line\" effect. Moreover, these studies indicate that the high locality in large-scale PCS network simulations make them well-suited for execution on general purpose parallel and distributed simulation platforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404313/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5010650","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A case study in simulating PCS networks using time warp","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case study in simulating PCS networks using time warp","confLoc":"Lake Placid, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00404313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047728S","chronDate":"14-16 Jun 1995","isNumber":"9095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3194","citationCount":"37","articleId":"404313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":404397,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Yi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Cheng Yi","id":"37087574481"},{"name":"E.

Parallel multipliers provide a high-speed method for multiplication, but require large area for VLSI implementations. In most signal processing applications, a rounded product is desired to avoid growth in word-size. Thus an important design goal is to reduce the area requirements of rounded output multipliers. The authors present a technique for parallel multiplication which computes the product of two numbers by summing only the most significant columns of the multiplication matrix, along with a correction constant. A method for selecting the value of the correction constant which minimizes the average and mean square error is introduced. Equations are given for estimating the average, mean square, and maximum error of the rounded product. With this technique, the hardware requirements of the multiplier can be reduced by 25 to 35%, while limiting the maximum error of the rounded product to less than one unit in the last place.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404467","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3196/9097/00404467.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truncated multiplication with correction constant [for DSP]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Truncated multiplication with correction constant [for DSP]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404467/","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4997373","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truncated multiplication with correction constant [for DSP]","confLoc":"Veldhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00404467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044253S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3196","citationCount":"111","articleId":"404467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":404469,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The simulations show that it is usually advantageous to work with /spl pi/ = 2 and to adjust the number of rotations/sweeps executed after each update to the specific application, since for small rotation angles (generally present in tracking applications) /spl pi/ = 2 already yields an almost exact rotation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9097","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3196/9097/00404471.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404471","startPage":"352","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bit level algorithm for subspace tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404471/","displayDocTitle":"A bit level algorithm for subspace tracking","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4997369","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bit level algorithm for subspace tracking","confLoc":"Veldhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00404471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033927S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3196","citationCount":"2","articleId":"404471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":404473,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The authors present a method for determining the optimal wordlengths for the filter bank tree of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In several applications such as image or speech coding, only the lower half subband is iteratively decomposed in the filter bank tree structure until a desired frequency resolution is achieved. As a result, the roundoff noise contribution (due to finite wordlength assignment) to the highest subband can be substantially different from that of the other subbands. The fixed point roundoff error expressions for DWT are derived from a statistical model. The optimal wordlength assignment problem is then formulated as balancing the roundoff noise power for each subband, while satisfying a desired total output noise constraint. It is shown to be a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem in general. For the particular case under consideration, it is then simplified and shown to be reducible to a Constrained Least Squares (CLS) problem. A solution to this CLS problem determines the optimal wordlengths. The results illustrate that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in the wordlength assigned to the output of the high-pass filter(s) in the analysis filter bank. A reduced wordlength in turn implies a more efficient data compression. Thus, the incorporation of precision constraints can yield additional bit-savings in applications like subband coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404473","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3196/9097/00404473.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal wordlength assignment for the discrete wavelet transform in VLSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404473/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal wordlength assignment for the discrete wavelet transform in VLSI","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997367","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal wordlength assignment for the discrete wavelet transform in VLSI","confLoc":"Veldhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00404473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041322S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3196","citationCount":"6","articleId":"404473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":404493,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The optimum choice of implementation parameters, such as signal wordlengths, is a critical design task since poor parameter choices can lead to costly designs. On the other hand, the high number of parameters to be selected span a large search space that is very difficult to handle. The authors present a new systematic approach to parameter selection and apply this approach to the design optimization of a decoding system for a concatenated coding scheme. Two convolutional codes are concatenated and both are decoded by soft decision decoding. This is facilitated by means of soft output decoding of the inner code. The performance of the scheme is better than that of the well known standard code with 64 states for moderate BER at equivalent implementation cost. The proposed coding scheme is thus an attractive alternative whenever high bit error rate performance is prerequisite, e.g. for digital HDTV transmission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404497/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4997343","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design optimization of a competitive soft-concatenated decoding system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design optimization of a competitive soft-concatenated decoding system","confLoc":"Veldhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00404497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054908S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3196","citationCount":"10","articleId":"404497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":404498,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This reduces the number of instruction cycles to implement these algorithms by the DSP compared with the DSPs having fewer registers. Reductions in the number of instruction cycles in realizing applications enable both reductions in the number of chips or in clock frequency which result in lowering power consumptions. By using fast DCT algorithm suitable for the DSP architecture, an 8-point DCT including I/O operations is realized in 35 instruction cycles which is less than the half of the instruction cycles required for the original algorithm based on a matrix vector multiplication.

The proposed tree architecture supports pipelined operations. The architecture is suitable for VLSI implementation, owing to modular properties. The Processing Elements (PEs) also support pipelining. An Application Specific circuit prototype has been designed for 4 /spl times/ 4 image blocks. The proposed architecture is scalable and can be easily be adopted for large image blocks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3196/9097/00404504.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSISP.1993.404504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9097","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for rate-distortion optimized motion compensation using variable size blocks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Rate-distortion","Motion compensation","Motion estimation","Image coding","Computer architecture","ISDN","Pulse modulation","Video compression","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","motion estimation","image coding","block codes","quadtrees","pipeline processing","application specific integrated circuits","VLSI","digital signal processing chips","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC prototype","VLSI architecture","rate-distortion optimized","motion compensation","variable size blocks","motion estimation","variable block matching scheme","rate allocation theory","optimum motion vector","quadtree decomposition","closed loop optimization","motion vector","pipelined operations","modular properties","scalable","large image blocks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for rate-distortion optimized motion compensation using variable size blocks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for rate-distortion optimized motion compensation using variable size blocks","confLoc":"Veldhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00404504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036369S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3196","citationCount":"1","articleId":"404504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":404505,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed architecture uses a parallel algorithm based on the idea of partial result accumulation. The partial sum results of the candidate block distortions are individually accumulated into cyclic storage buffer for each distortion measure. A parameterizable Motion Estimation Processor (MEP) is designed for both different reference block sizes and various search ranges. Moreover, for larger search ranges and high throughput rates, multiple number of MEPs can be cascaded. It has serial data input but performs parallel processing. It can be easily and cost-effectively implemented into VLSI by its simple one dimensional semi-systolic array architecture and control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventh Annual IEEE International ASIC Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel2/3197/9098/00404564.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Seventh Annual IEEE International ASIC Conference and Exhibit","doi":"10.1109/ASIC.1994.404564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIC.1994.404564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=404564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI design for full search block matching motion estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion estimation","Distortion measurement","Parallel processing","Systolic arrays","Logic arrays","Buffer storage","Moon","Design automation","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","integrated circuit design","motion estimation","real-time systems","parallel algorithms","systolic arrays","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","full-search block matching algorithm","motion estimation","flexible VLSI architecture","real-time processing","parallel algorithm","partial result accumulation","block distortions","cyclic storage buffer","distortion measure","search ranges","throughput rates","serial data input","parallel processing","one dimensional semi-systolic array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI design for full search block matching motion estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI design for full search block matching motion estimation","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00404564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038453S","chronDate":"19-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3197","citationCount":"2","articleId":"404564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":404569,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

However, the complexity of the RIE process has prompted the use of empirical models utilizing neural networks, which offer advantages in both accuracy and robustness over statistical methods. In this paper, a neural network trained to model the correlation between DC bias and etch rate was used to predict the time required to remove a specified thickness of silicon dioxide (SiO/sub 2/) in a CHF/sub 3//O/sub 2/ plasma. A real-time data acquisition system that transmits process conditions from a Plasma Therm 700 series RIE system was used to monitor DC bias during etching. A back-propagation neural network was trained to predict the amount of time required to etch the remaining amount of film while in the midst of etching. Inputs to the network included elapsed time during the etch run, the desired etch depth, gas flow rates, chamber pressure, and RF power. This network exhibited a 26-second RMS error on training data, and predicted the process endpoint on a set of test etch recipes with an average error of less than two minutes for a process time of about 25 minutes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/404725/","accessionNumber":"5027099","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"In-situ prediction of RIE time to completion using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-situ prediction of RIE time to completion using neural networks","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00404725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053034S","chronDate":"12-14 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3198","articleId":"404725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":404894,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The authors have proposed a novel topology with auxiliary transformer-assisted quasi-resonant commutated pole (TQRCP) circuit which can operate under a principle of zero-voltage switching (ZVS) transition without initial resonant current control loop. In this paper, the high-frequency ZVS-PWM power amplifier which incorporates auxiliary TQRCP circuits into the bridge legs is newly developed for the magnetic-field current tracking control system. The control implementation for achieving a precise magnetic-field current tracking realization with low ripple factor is introduced into the switched-mode PWM power amplifier and its design considerations are described for an efficient generation of gradient-magnetic-fields in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines.

As compared with conventional flux-weakening control, the approach has definite advantages in that it can be applied to squarewave PM brushless motor drives directly, and even to motor drives with negligible mutual inductances between phase windings. Moreover, it is easier to implement than flux-weakening control because no coordinate transformation is needed. The key of this approach is to make use of the transformer EMF in such a way that it weakens the rotational EMF when the motor operates above the base speed, leading to achieve the constant power operation.

As a consequence, short-circuit currents (I/sub sc/) increase, leading to high mechanical and thermal stresses. All electrical equipment has to be designed to withstand these stresses. It is obvious, from both technical and economical points of view, that a device that reduces the I/sub sc/ is needed. All the solutions realized up to now have substantial disadvantages. They fulfil only a few of the characteristics expected of an ideal fault current limiter. The advantages and disadvantages of high temperature superconductors for fault current limiters are briefly mentioned.

The insight from this study guides the development of a physical, two-dimensional analytic model for the subthreshold current and charge, which is linked to our strong-inversion formalism in SOISPICE for circuit simulation. The model is verified by PISCES simulations of scaled devices. The utility of the model in SOISPICE is demonstrated by using it to define a viable design for deep-submicrometer fully depleted SOI CMOS technology based on simulated speed and static power in low-voltage digital circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053343","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Physical subthreshold MOSFET modeling applied to viable design of deep-submicrometer fully depleted SOI low-voltage CMOS technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical subthreshold MOSFET modeling applied to viable design of deep-submicrometer fully depleted SOI low-voltage CMOS technology","sourcePdf":"00405274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065891S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"97","articleId":"405274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":405283,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

This paper for the first time shows that low-chirp MQW (multiquantum well)-EA (electroabsorption) external modulators are applicable to AM-SCM transmission systems. The feedforward linearization technique is used to compensate the signal distortion due to the nonlinearity in the modulator's L-V (light power versus voltage) characteristic. The effectiveness of this type of modulator for suppressing dispersion-induced distortion is clarified experimentally. A feedforward linearized transmitter with composite second order (CSO) intermodulation distortion <-62 dBc, composite triple beat (CTB) intermodulation distortion <-59 dBc and a carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) >50.5 dB is successfully constructed. It is shown that the transmitter can achieve a CSO <-59 dBc, a CTB <-57 dBc and a CNR >49.5 dB for a 32 channel AM signal and 10 km transmission. Furthermore, estimations of the signal distortion cancellation and the noise characteristic achieved with feedforward circuit modeling are shown. The results obtained here emphasize that MQW-EA external modulators are applicable to AM-SCM transmission systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5060186","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"8","displayDocTitle":"Signal distortion and noise in AM-SCM transmission systems employing the feedforward linearized MQW-EA external modulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal distortion and noise in AM-SCM transmission systems employing the feedforward linearized MQW-EA external modulator","sourcePdf":"00405302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063284S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","articleId":"405302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":405303,"authors":[{"name":"Miin-Jong Hao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Miin-Jong Hao","id":"37346374100"},{"name":"S.B.

Since the classical procedure becomes ill-conditioned as the order of the moments increases, we consider the construction of Gaussian quadrature rules (GQR) from the modified moments. The analysis accounts for the influences of IF bandwidth, transmitter and local oscillator laser phase noise, postdetection filters, and additive Gaussian noise. It is found that the proposed approach is a highly reliable and efficient method for calculating the error probability. A comparison with results obtained from the Gaussian quadrature rule, Gaussian approximation method, and analytical approximation formulas shows that this technique is very accurate. Analytical expressions are derived for FSK and CPFSK receivers which include polarization and phase diversity techniques. The use of numerical programming to avoid many unnecessary computations is discussed.

High optical performance such as low loss, low reflection, and thermal stability are obtained through the use of this fiber connection technique. Ten reliability tests including long-term environmental and mechanical tests were carried out for more than ten PLC splitter modules. Under one of the most severe sets of conditions (75/spl deg/C and 90% RH), all the 19 samples we tested were stable for more than 5000 hours.

Variable width pulses control the monophasic inverter switching. The duration of each pulse was established by comparing the input (reference signal) and a sample of the amplified output signal, the difference between both produces the error signal that determines in real time the pulse width. A lowpass filter was connected to the inverter output the principal function of which was to eliminate the high frequencies due to the inverter chopping. This amplifier can work with any signal shape inside its bandwidth and also corrects the nonlinearities from the system. Distortions lower than 1% can be obtained with this kind of amplifier. This technique leads to two main advantages: high power amplifiers with high efficiency; and (2) a considerable reduction in the amplifier size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5009850","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Audio amplifier based on a monophasic inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio amplifier based on a monophasic inverter","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00405648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026155S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3218","articleId":"405648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":405655,"authors":[{"name":"Sharaf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Sharaf","id":"37087519456"},{"name":"Soliman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Soliman","id":"37087547510"},{"name":"Mansour","affiliation":["Department of Elec Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"lastName":"Mansour","id":"38271707300"},{"name":"Kandil","affiliation":["Department of Elec Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"lastName":"Kandil","id":"37087547889"},{"name":"El-Shafii","affiliation":["Department of Elec Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"lastName":"El-Shafii","id":"37087546678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2416-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"405655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=405655","abstract":"DC motor drives are widely used in many industrial process applications including mining, steel, chemical, pulp and paper, conveyors and electrical traction.

A generic load model is presented as a simple dynamic model suitable for wide-scale implementation using a GRNN and integrating measurement-based data. Finally, ongoing and future work are discussed, and preliminary conclusions are stated based on experience to date. The paper is application oriented. Its major contribution is the structuring of the load parameter identification problem into a form conveniently handled by neural networks. Generation of a training set is facilitated by the use of a simplified dynamic equivalent load model whose parameters are easily identified to form a training set from system measurements using least squares procedures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405658/","accessionNumber":"5009840","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Aggregate load parameter identification using general regression neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregate load parameter identification using general regression neural networks","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00405658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062976S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3218","articleId":"405658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":405659,"authors":[{"name":"Damarla","affiliation":["Tennessee Technological University, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Damarla","id":"37087579260"},{"name":"Chandrasekaran","affiliation":["Tennessee Technological University, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Chandrasekaran","id":"37087578896"},{"name":"Sundaram","affiliation":["Custom Power Distribution Program, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sundaram","id":"37087575538"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2416-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"405659","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system faults","Power system simulation","Neural network applications","Fuzzy neural networks","Data acquisition","Feedforward neural networks","Fuzzy control","Power system control","Power quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system analysis computing","fuzzy neural nets","data acquisition","feedforward neural nets","fuzzy control","power system control","data analysis","electrical faults","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system disturbances classification","fuzzy neural network","data collection programs","electric power utilities","power quality problems","data classification","data characterization","artificial neural network","sags","swells","waveform distortions","interruptions","impulses","feedforward neural nets","fuzzy logic controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=405659","abstract":"Electric power utilities have launched comprehensive data collection programs to evaluate the power quality problems in their systems.

Using traditional precoding techniques, the amplitude of transmitted signals cannot be kept constant due to amplitude predistortion. To improve the frequency spectrum efficiency, a new precoding method is investigated. Only the phase of the signal carrier is predistorted at the transmitter of the base station, and the signal received at the portable unit is ISI free. The information of the received signal amplitude is used for detection. Computer simulation results demonstrate that, over a two-path Rician fading channel, differential QPSK with precoding has significantly lower BER values than those with a conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) since the precoder is not subject to error propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

We observe that the one-memory detector can achieve almost optimum performance at the expense of only one memory unit under the weakly dependent noise model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1994.405745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1994.405745","startPage":"288","endPage":"291 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/3218/9123/00405745.pdf","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite sample-size performance of known signal detectors in a weakly dependent noise model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Finite sample-size performance of known signal detectors in a weakly dependent noise model","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5015579","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405745/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite sample-size performance of known signal detectors in a weakly dependent noise model","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00405745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067334S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3218","articleId":"405745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":405788,"authors":[{"name":"Grzeszczak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Grzeszczak","id":"37354443400"},{"name":"Yeap","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yeap","id":"37274191900"},{"name":"Panchanathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Panchanathan","id":"37273597000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2416-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"405788","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture for discrete wavelet transform","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/3218/9123/00405788.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"464 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1994.405788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9123","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1994.405788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very-large-scale integration","Wavelet transforms","Image processing","Digital signal processors","Systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","wavelet transforms","image processing","digital signal processing chips","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","discrete wavelet transform","systolic architecture","frequency doubler","coefficient calculations","multipliers","modular architecture","cascadable architecture","image processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=405788","abstract":"This paper presents a new VLSI architecture for computing the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

So far the most common types of neural networks used in the power field have been the layered perceptron, trained with a backpropagation algorithm (supervised learning), and Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (unsupervised learning). This paper presents results obtained through the use of the first of these NN techniques, in the assessment of small signal stability of a single-machine infinite-bus power system. Certain variables of interest (real and reactive power) are considered as the inputs, while different types of outputs are chosen and the performance of the NNs compared for each of the cases. A layered perceptron is trained and employed as a classifier (stable or unstable point), and as a regression machine (interpolating a numerical value), depending on the kind of the output, in order to increase the speed of assessment of the stability of the system. A power system stabilizer (PSS) applied to the generator excitation system is also considered, and results are compared with the previous analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1994.405855","startPage":"730","endPage":"733 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1994.405855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9123","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 Proceedings of Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/3218/9123/00405855.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network assessment of small signal stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405855/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network assessment of small signal stability","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5016312","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network assessment of small signal stability","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00405855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027889S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3218","citationCount":"1","articleId":"405855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":405856,"authors":[{"name":"Heping Dal","affiliation":["Atlantic Nucl.

A simple nonlinear structure and an algorithm for implementing and simulating the model based on the behavior of the media is designed. The assumption of suitable parameters in the modeling permits us to design a more accurate model. A model that responds to the acoustical input is employed to test the artificial neural network's ability in signal prediction and parameter estimation. Experimental results from the implemented programs are presented. A feed-forward multi-layered neural network trained by the back-propagation algorithm using the min-max amplitude ranges of an output signal of the UWLM is designed and evaluated. This is based on a computer simulation of synthetic data, to estimate the parameters of the media including attenuation factors, reflection coefficients, travel times and decay parameters. Based on experiments estimating the parameters of the media and predicting its output signal, the network produces the same computational results as those of the original assumed media structure. The results of computer simulation of the underwater layered media modeling in conjunction with the proposed neural network training process are given. The results suggest that the proposed network can supplement, or replace conventional techniques for parameter estimation and output prediction in system identification. The method presented also offers advantages in speed and efficiency over existing estimates techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405867/","accessionNumber":"5016324","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based signal prediction and parameter estimation for underwater layered media systems identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based signal prediction and parameter estimation for underwater layered media systems identification","confLoc":"Halifax, NS, Canada","sourcePdf":"00405867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037152S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3218","citationCount":"2","articleId":"405867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":405871,"authors":[{"name":"El-Khouly","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Menoufia University, Egypt"],"lastName":"El-Khouly","id":"37087546785"},{"name":"Sharaf","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Sharaf","id":"37087519456"},{"name":"Abdel-Ghaffar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Menoufia University, Egypt"],"lastName":"Abdel-Ghaffar","id":"37087548075"},{"name":"Mohammed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Menoufia University, Egypt"],"lastName":"Mohammed","id":"37087547501"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2416-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"405871","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator motion-planning","Position control","Motion control","Neurocontrollers","Self-organizing control","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","position control","motion control","neurocontrollers","self-adjusting systems","intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online tunable neural network position regulator","on-line tunable neural network position regulator","single link robotic arm","single-link robotic arm","online self tunable neural network position controller","arm model uncertainty","parametric variations","sudden load excursions","robot arm position","specified reference trajectory","minimum steady state error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=405871","abstract":"The paper presents the development of an online self tunable neural network position controller for a single link robotic arm.

Traveling wave field effect transistor (TWFET) is a solid state device designed to amplify signals over a wide bandwidth. An analysis of the passive behavior of this device has been performed using mode-matching technique and assuming that the passive structure performances are affected only by the width of the T bar of the gate electrode. To verify such hypothesis and to determine the cut-off frequency of the higher order modes that limits its bandwidth, we have simplified the 2D-FDTD method with a particular normalization, that permits the analysis of the case /spl beta/=0. The proposed approach was tested calculating the dispersion for some known structures and it has been used in the TWFET characterization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved 2D-FDTD method for TWFET bandwidth characterization","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1995.405989","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00405989.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"792 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.405989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=405989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/405989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"An improved 2D-FDTD method for TWFET bandwidth characterization","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5005205","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved 2D-FDTD method for TWFET bandwidth characterization","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00405989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039583S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","articleId":"405989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":405991,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It has realized a high PAE of 66% with Pout of 31 dBm (1.25 W) under the condition of 3.5 V around 915-945 MHz band.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406020","startPage":"579","endPage":"584 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00406020.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high power and high efficiency amplifier with controlled second-harmonic source impedance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A high power and high efficiency amplifier with controlled second-harmonic source impedance","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5005174","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406020/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high power and high efficiency amplifier with controlled second-harmonic source impedance","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028453S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"14","articleId":"406020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":406025,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The Gaussian beam open resonator consists of a pair of spherical mirrors with highly reflective partially transparent circular coupling regions and a plane minor, where the plane minor is the test sample. Application of this new method to reflection type measurement enabled simultaneous attainment of high Q factor and high signal-to-noise ratio, which would have been impossible using a conventional reflection-type open resonator with a small coupling hole. Moreover, the use of a pair of identical spherical mirrors enabled direct measurement of the Q of these mirrors, which is equal to Q/sub others/, without changing the experimental conditions. Surface loss measurements of metal films are made at 100 GHz band. In the room temperature experiment, surface resistance of 110 m/spl Omega/ was measured with an accuracy of /spl plusmn/7.6%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5005169","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Absolute loss measurement of highly reflective samples by using a high Q Gaussian beam open resonator at short millimeter wave frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absolute loss measurement of highly reflective samples by using a high Q Gaussian beam open resonator at short millimeter wave frequencies","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027368S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","articleId":"406025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":406030,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The PIN diode is made from the intrinsic MBE layers of the HBT collector-base junction which consists of a 7000 /spl Aring/ thick i-region. The novel VGA topology employs active feedback and output buffering to obtain high IP3 performance and is the first PIN-HBT VGA reported of its kind. The VGA obtains 10 dB gain and over 25 dB of gain control range at 1 GHz. The output IP3 is 15.1 dBm and the noise figure is 9.3 dB at maximum gain. The corresponding input IP3 is 15.1 dBm and remains constant over gain control which is an attractive feature of the HBT-PIN VGA. The PIN diode VGA design is realized in a miniature 0.8/spl times/0.4 mm/sup 2/ area. Integrated with a previously developed HBT LNA, the resultant low noise VGA MMIC demonstrates 2.1 dB noise figure, >35 dB gain, +13.5 dBm OIP3, and over 25 dB of gain control at 1 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406066","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00406066.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"204 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel baseband-1.5 GHz monolithic HBT variable gain amplifier with PIN diode gain control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"A novel baseband-1.5 GHz monolithic HBT variable gain amplifier with PIN diode gain control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4997903","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406066/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel baseband-1.5 GHz monolithic HBT variable gain amplifier with PIN diode gain control","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02544S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"2","articleId":"406066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":406090,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A promising solution which avoids conventional phased array techniques is to use an array of receivers and the methods of digital beam forming in order to extract the complete 2D radar information. Angular resolution is in this case closely related to the number of receiving antennas respectively downconverters. A complete AICC-system working on these principles using four receivers has been built and published elsewhere. This paper shows that angular resolution can be improved at least by a factor of two without increasing the number of antennas and receivers by multiplexing the transmitter location. Two different configurations are compared. A very cost-effective way is to realize the necessary switching operations in the IF-band. Linear prediction algorithms are applied to fill the arising gap, leading to the full expected lateral resolution transmit while maintaining sufficient side-lobe suppression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","startPage":"969","endPage":"972 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00406134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of angular resolution of a millimeterwave imaging system by transmitter location multiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of angular resolution of a millimeterwave imaging system by transmitter location multiplexing","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5016562","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of angular resolution of a millimeterwave imaging system by transmitter location multiplexing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050489S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"7","articleId":"406134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":406144,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Ping Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Xing Ping Lin","id":"37289264500"},{"name":"K.

The technical originality of the proposed system lies in that the first, second and third harmonic load terminations can be independently and automatically monitored and fixed while varying the input power driving the transistor at the fundamental frequency. Appropriate hardware and software allow fast and automatic plots of power/efficiency performances of DUTs versus input power for different harmonic loadings. To demonstrate an attractive application of the system, measurements of a 1800 /spl mu/m gate periphery MESFET at 1.8 GHz for mobile communication applications are presented. Both suitable harmonic load terminations and nonappropriate ones yielding respectively optimum and poor power added efficiency are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5016577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel computerized multiharmonic active load-pull system for the optimization of high efficiency operating classes in power transistors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel computerized multiharmonic active load-pull system for the optimization of high efficiency operating classes in power transistors","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041897S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"24","articleId":"406149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":406152,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Classical methods of nonlinearity analysis, such as the third-order intercept point, are ill-suited for systems based on digitally modulated signals. The third-order intercept point ignores higher-order effects and latent out-of-channel power, both of which affect spectrum regeneration. Using a power spectral density description of the source, coupled with a simplified Volterra series model of a GaAs MESFET, it is shown that reactive nonlinearity contributes to spectrum regeneration. Subsequently, insight is gained at the device level for doping/implant improvements and at the terminal level for optimal loading, resulting in improved linearity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00406227.pdf","startPage":"1375","endPage":"1378 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of GaAs MESFET spectrum regeneration driven by a /spl pi//4-DQPSK modulated source","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Digital modulation","Signal analysis","Couplings","Semiconductor process modeling","Power system modeling","Doping","Implants","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Schottky gate field effect transistors","microwave field effect transistors","quadrature phase shift keying","Volterra series","semiconductor doping","semiconductor device models","III-V semiconductors","gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MESFET spectrum regeneration","/spl pi//4-DQPSK modulated source","transistor nonlinearity","digital modulation","nonlinearity analysis","higher-order effects","latent out-of-channel power","power spectral density description","Volterra series model","reactive nonlinearity","device level","doping/implant improvements","terminal level","optimal loading","microwave FETs","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of GaAs MESFET spectrum regeneration driven by a /spl pi//4-DQPSK modulated source","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5022479","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of GaAs MESFET spectrum regeneration driven by a /spl pi//4-DQPSK modulated source","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044456S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"5","articleId":"406227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":406228,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A coupled line shielded microstrip implementation of a 5-element 0.5 dB equal ripple Chebyshev filter achieves a minimum insertion loss of 3.4 dB with a 6.1% bandwidth centered at 94.7 GHz. The measured filter performance shows very sharp cutoff with out of band attenuation better than 25 dB and input return loss better than 8 dB. Results are also presented for a 5-element filter that achieves a minimum insertion loss of 2.2 dB with an 11.3% bandwidth centered at 94.7 GHz, and a 3-element filter with 1.3 dB insertion loss and 16.4% bandwidth at 94.9 GHz.

Test assemblies with coplanar waveguides have been attached in flip chip and wire bond technology and measured up to 75 GHz. Further, the influence of a metallic lid on a coplanar waveguide structure is examined. To compare flip chip and wire bond interconnections, 51 GHz frontends with GaAs devices in coplanar waveguide technology have been realized. In one frontend the low noise amplifier (LNA) is connected to a planar patch antenna by wire bonding and in a second one by flip chip attachment. RF evaluations show the clear advantage of the flip chip version due to the lower insertion loss of the flip chip interconnections and the higher flexibility of mounting the MMICs directly on the back structure of the planar patch antenna, leading to reduced losses of the feedline.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1995.406291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9124","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1642 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/3219/9124/00406291.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flip chip","Wire","Bonding","Coplanar waveguides","Patch antennas","Testing","Assembly","Waveguide components","Semiconductor device measurement","Gallium arsenide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lead bonding","flip-chip devices","integrated circuit interconnections","microassembling","coplanar waveguides","MMIC amplifiers","millimetre wave receivers","millimetre wave antennas","microstrip antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MM-wave frontend","flip chip interconnections","wire bond interconnections","planar patch antenna","GaAs MMIC","coplanar waveguides","metallic lid","CPW technology","low noise amplifier","LNA","insertion loss","51 GHz","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"51 GHz frontend with flip chip and wire bond interconnections from GaAs MMICs to a planar patch antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5022543","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406291/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"51 GHz frontend with flip chip and wire bond interconnections from GaAs MMICs to a planar patch antenna","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00406291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030973S","chronDate":"16-20 May 1995","isNumber":"9124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3219","citationCount":"38","articleId":"406291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":406295,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

In order to reduce the chip size drastically, an SGT is employed to all the transistors within a chip. SGT's connected in series and a common source SGT have been newly developed for the core circuit, such as a sense amplifier designed by a tight design rule. Furthermore, to reduce the inherent cell array noise caused by a relaxed open bit line (BL) architecture, a noise killer circuit placed in the word line (WL) shunt region and a twisted BL architecture within the sense amplifier region combined with a novel separation sensing scheme have been newly introduced. Using the novel circuit technology, a 32.9% smaller chip size can be successfully achieved for a 64-Mb DRAM and 34.4% for a 1-Gb DRAM compared with a DRAM composed of the planar transistor without sacrificing the access time, power dissipation, and V/sub cc/ margin. Furthermore,the effectiveness of this technology is verified by using the circuit simulation of the internal main nodes such as WL and BL.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.406391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/9126/00406391.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.406391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"960","endPage":"971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel circuit technology with surrounding gate transistors (SGT's) for ultra high density DRAM's","volume":"30","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5053313","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel circuit technology with surrounding gate transistors (SGT's) for ultra high density DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00406391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059471S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"31","articleId":"406391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":406396,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In a TCM (time compression multiplexing)-TDMA (time division multiple access) fiber-optic subscriber system, a receiver should be able to handle burst-data packets with different amplitude. This requires quick response and a wide dynamic range. Instantaneous response is achieved with a new feed-forward auto-bias adjustment technique. In addition, multistaged offset compensation provides a wide dynamic range without any external elements and adjustments.

Data lines by second-level of metal above memory cells achieve a low power and area efficient full bit prefetch capability. An experimental 3.3-V 16-Mb SDRAM is developed based on this architecture. Since the full burst read data are latched in I/O sense amplifiers by a single CAS access, a precharge operation can start as early as two clocks before the data burst cycles begin. The early precharge function allows next RAS and CAS accesses during burst reads of the previous data. With a burst length of eight, a seamless read operation is possible for any row addresses even within the same bank. The full bit prefetch architecture enables low active power data burst operations because high frequency clock driven circuits are limited to the data path only. The SDRAM with a 1M/spl times/16-b configuration dissipates a 65-mA active current at a 100-MHz full page mode operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.406399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.406399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/9126/00406399.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A full bit prefetch architecture for synchronous DRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A full bit prefetch architecture for synchronous DRAM's","volume":"30","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053318","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406399/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A full bit prefetch architecture for synchronous DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00406399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038953S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"406399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":406409,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The macros use the same area efficient one transistor trench cells as 4-Mb (SPT cell) and 16-R Mb (MINT cell) DRAM products. It is shown that the trench cells with capacitor plates by the grounded substrate are ideal structures as embedded DRAM's. The trench cells built entirely under the silicon surface allow cost effective DRAM and CMOS logic merged process technologies. In the 0.8-/spl mu/m rule, the DRAM macro has a 32-K/spl times/9-b configuration in a silicon area of 1.7/spl times/5.0 mm/sup 2/. It achieves a 27-ns access and a 50-ns cycle times. The other DRAM macro in the 0.5-/spl mu/m technology is organized in 64 K/spl times/18 b. It has a macro area of 2.1/spl times/4.9 mm and demonstrated a 23-ns access and a 40-ns cycle times. Small densities and multiple bit data configurations provide a flexibility to ASIC designs and a wide variety of application capabilities. Multiple uses of the DRAM macros bring significant performance leverages to ASIC chips because of the wide data bus and the fast access and cycle times. A data rate more than 1.3 Gb/s is possible by a single chip.

It is, however, still dominant in the production of electronic design automation (EDA) software which supports semiconductor integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Research on EDA software is performed primarily in US universities. Early use of such software by the US semiconductor industry should constitute a precompetitive advantage that would help to compensate for the US's tack of competitiveness in manufacturing; however, because of the different natures of universities and industry, a significant technology transfer gap exists between them. Universities produce prototype software as research results, whereas the semiconductor industry would prefer to have robust rather than prototype versions. To bridge the gap, it has been proposed that the EDA industry be emulated and undergraduate engineering students used as field applications engineers (UFAEs).

The issues pertaining to the effects of the modules in influencing the overall radiating capacity of the configuration are addressed. Analyses are facilitated by using simplified modules-on-backplane models and by using a voltage source as the source of electromagnetic energy at a connector between a module and the backplane. The potential for enhancement of spurious emissions by the module-on-backplane configuration is demonstrated. For modules of typical dimensions, resonance is observed at the hundreds of MHz frequency range.

The model is a quasi-three-dimensional one in the sense that the building walls are assumed to be much higher than the transmitter height so that the diffractions from the rooftops can be neglected. It is based on the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) and takes into account multiple reflections between wall-to-wall, wall-to-ground and ground-to-wall, as well as the diffraction from corners of buildings and also subsequent reflections from such diffracted signals. These multiple reflections and diffraction result in an extremely complex problem of tracking the wave or ray propagation. The authors use the concept of multiple images and the generalized Fermat's principle to facilitate the location of each point of reflection in a wall or ground or a point of diffraction at an edge, and to determine which of the multiply scattered rays will reach the receiver at a line-of-sight (LOS) or out-of-sight (OOS) position. The signal path loss along the LOS street, OOS side streets, as well as a street which runs parallel to the LOS street, are calculated and the general features and trends of the propagation characteristics are highlighted. Calculations are also done to study the profile of the signal distribution across a street width at various points in a OOS street.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.406523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/9130/00406523.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.406523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theory for propagation path-loss characteristics in a city-street grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406523/","displayDocTitle":"A theory for propagation path-loss characteristics in a city-street grid","volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047095","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theory for propagation path-loss characteristics in a city-street grid","sourcePdf":"00406523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045695S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"47","articleId":"406523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":406530,"authors":[{"name":"L.

By making use of all information available to the receiver, it is demonstrated that considerable reduction in the number of threshold levels required can be achieved in systems where the data encoding obeys run length limit constraints.

The authors simulate call performance for users accessing channels in a regular cellular array with a base located at the center of each hexagon. The computer model includes stochastic channel demand and a propagation environment characterized by attenuation with distance as well as shadow fading. The study of LADCA shows that distributed power control and channel access can be combined in an access management policy that achieves satisfactory system capacity and provides desired call performance. The authors report: LADCA/power control is observed to be stable alleviating a major concern about users unaware of the signal to interference problems their presence on a channel might cause to others. There can be substantial inadvertent dropping of calls in progress caused by originating calls. Modeling user time dynamics is essential.

In the path-by-path decorrelator, each of the received signals corresponding to one of the multiple propagation paths is regarded as an independent interference source. On the contrary, in the channel-matched decorrelator, each composite signal transmitted from an identical user is regarded as a response of the multipath channel to the corresponding user's spreading sequence. The asymptotic efficiency of the path-by-path decorrelator is shown to drop rapidly as the number of simultaneous users increases. It is shown that the asymptotic efficiency can be made independent of the number of the propagation paths by the channel-matched decorrelator at the expense of requiring knowledge about the fading complex envelopes of all the propagation paths. The proposed joint multiuser detection and channel estimation scheme uses both path-by-path and channel-matched decorrelators. The path-by-path decorrelator is used for providing the channel estimator with the (noisy) channel information path-by-path, and decisions are made on the output of the channel-matched decorrelator. The decision results are fed back to the channel estimator, and used as the reference signals. The received complex envelope of each of the propagation paths is estimated in the channel estimator. Results of a series of exhaustive computer simulations are presented in order to demonstrate the overall performance of the proposed scheme, both in non-fading and fading multipath propagation environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decorrelation","Multiuser detection","Channel estimation","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Fading","Detectors","Interference","Bit error rate","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multipath channels","fading","land mobile radio","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint decorrelating multiuser detection","channel estimation","asynchronous CDMA mobile communications channels","asymptotic efficiencies","channel-matched decorrelators","path-by-path decorrelators","fading multipath propagation environments","multiple propagation paths","independent interference source","spreading sequence","multipath channel","fading complex envelopes","reference signals","computer simulations","performance","nonfading multipath propagation environment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406617","doi":"10.1109/25.406617","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/9133/00406617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.406617","startPage":"506","endPage":"515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint decorrelating multiuser detection and channel estimation in asynchronous CDMA mobile communications channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint decorrelating multiuser detection and channel estimation in asynchronous CDMA mobile communications channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047176","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint decorrelating multiuser detection and channel estimation in asynchronous CDMA mobile communications channels","sourcePdf":"00406617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.302856S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","articleId":"406617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":406619,"authors":[{"name":"Dong In Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Seoul City University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong In Kim","id":"37279315300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"406619","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"A code-division multiple-access scheme that requires a reduced set of code sequences, in which the size of the set is much less than the number of users in the system, is proposed for mobile radio communications.

In this paper, we propose a method which aims at the reduction of signaling overhead on the radio link produced by the paging procedure. The key idea is the application of a multiple step paging strategy which operates as follows: at the instance of a call terminating to a mobile user who roams within a certain location area, paging is initially performed in a portion of the location area (the paging area) that the so-called \"paging related information\" indicates. On no paging response, the mobile user is paged in the complementary portion of the location area-this phase can be completed in more than one (paging) step. Various \"paging related information\" elements (e.g. recent interaction information, high mobility flag, etc.) can be used and several \"intelligent\" paging strategies can be defined. Representative paging strategies are analyzed in terms of network performance and quality of service (paging signaling, paging delay, processing power requirements), via a simulation tool which models a realistic city area environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.406621","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/9133/00406621.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.406621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"543","endPage":"554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent paging strategies for third generation mobile telecommunication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent paging strategies for third generation mobile telecommunication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406621/","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5047180","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent paging strategies for third generation mobile telecommunication systems","sourcePdf":"00406621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039283S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"71","articleId":"406621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":406623,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is very robust to fast multiplicative Rayleigh fading and is suitable for mobile telephone systems and personal communication networks. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation and bit error probability simulation of the maximum likelihood differential detector using phase differences and amplitude ratios from L diversity branches for bit decisions. As a comparison, much simpler previously known post detection combining techniques are generalized for star 16QAM and optimized. The bit error probability is simulated for both diversity detectors on a multiplicative Rayleigh fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise. It is found that the bit error probability of the ML detector may also be obtained by the simple combining detector. This is also true for the error floor due to the maximum Doppler frequency.

To overcome the problems of errors and their accumulation, we have developed a weighted least-squares (WLS) approach which simultaneously recovers object shape and transformation among different views without recovering interframe motion. We show that object modeling from a range image sequence is a problem of principal component analysis with missing data (PCAMD), which can be generalized as a WLS minimization problem. An efficient algorithm is devised. After we have segmented planar surface regions in each view and tracked them over the image sequence, we construct a normal measurement matrix of surface normals, and a distance measurement matrix of normal distances to the origin for all visible regions over the whole sequence of views, respectively. These two matrices, which have many missing elements due to noise, occlusion, and mismatching, enable us to formulate multiple view merging as a combination of two WLS problems. A two-step algorithm is presented. After surface equations are extracted, spatial connectivity among the surfaces is established to enable the polyhedral object model to be constructed. Experiments using synthetic data and real range images show that our approach is robust against noise and mismatching and generates accurate polyhedral object models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/9134/00406651.pdf","startPage":"854","endPage":"867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.406651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.406651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal component analysis with missing data and its application to polyhedral object modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Shape","Image sequences","Image segmentation","Distance measurement","Merging","Equations","Data mining","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","least squares approximations","minimisation","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis","PCA","missing data","polyhedral object modeling","observation-based object modeling","shape descriptions","weighted least-squares approach","shape recovery","transformation recovery","segmented planar surface regions","image sequence","normal measurement matrix","surface normals","distance measurement matrix","normal distances","noise","occlusion","mismatching","multiple view merging","two-step algorithm","spatial connectivity","polyhedral object model","synthetic data","real range images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Principal component analysis with missing data and its application to polyhedral object modeling","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068820","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal component analysis with missing data and its application to polyhedral object modeling","sourcePdf":"00406651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057181S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"137","articleId":"406651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":406653,"authors":[{"name":"H.

As the image plane changes, different parts of the object come in view or drop out of view. However, for small changes of the image plane, most parts continue to remain visible and their qualitative embedding in the image remains similar. Therefore, similarity of part embeddings can be used to infer similarity of image planes. Part embeddings are useful features for other vision applications as well. In view of this, a spatial relation called \"arrangement\" is proposed to describe part embeddings. The relation describes how each part is surrounded by its neighbors. Further, a metric for arrangements is formulated by expressing arrangements in terms of the Voronoi diagram of the parts. Arrangements and their metric are used to retrieve images by image plane similarity in a cardiac magnetic resonance image database. Experiments with the database are reported which (1) validate the observation that similarity of image planes can be inferred from similarity of part embeddings, and (2) compare the performance of arrangement based image retrieval with that of expert radiologists.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406653/","volume":"17","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"5068822","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Arrangement: a spatial relation between parts for evaluating similarity of tomographic section","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arrangement: a spatial relation between parts for evaluating similarity of tomographic section","sourcePdf":"00406653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061617S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"27","articleId":"406653","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":406655,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Intensity gradient analysis (IGA) is a robust technique for inferring depth information from a sequence of images acquired by a sensor undergoing translational motion. IGA obviates the need for explicitly solving the correspondence problem and hence is an efficient technique for range estimation. Many applications require real time processing at very high frame rates. The design of special purpose hardware could significantly speed up the computations in IGA. In this paper, we propose two VLSI architectures for high-speed range estimation based on IGA. The architectures fully utilize the principles of pipelining and parallelism in order to obtain high speed and throughput.

SIR-C/X-SAR data have been used to validate algorithms which produce maps of vegetation type and biomass; snow, soil and vegetation moisture; and the distribution of wetlands, developed with earlier aircraft data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.406668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.406668","endPage":"828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9135/00406668.pdf","startPage":"817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of results of Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C, X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406668/","displayDocTitle":"Overview of results of Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C, X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)","volume":"33","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5047277","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of results of Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C, X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)","sourcePdf":"00406668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062999S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"80","articleId":"406668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":406669,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The multifaceted SIR-C/X-SAR represents a major technological step forward in radar remote sensing and is the first spaceborne multifrequency, polarimetric SAR. The United States developed SIR-C operated at L- and C-band, each with quad polarization. The SIR-C antenna was an active phased array, with the capability for electronic beam steering and multiple swath width illumination. The German/Italian X-SAR operated at X-band with a single polarization using a slotted waveguide antenna, mechanically steerable in elevation. SIR-C and X-SAR were designed to operate synchronously, collecting data over common sites synchronously. A total of 143 hours (93 terabits) of SAR data were recorded on tape.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9135/00406669.pdf","startPage":"829","endPage":"839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.406669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.406669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The SIR-C/X-SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Spaceborne radar","Space technology","Radar remote sensing","Polarization","Phased arrays","Space shuttles","Radar imaging","Radar polarimetry","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","radar applications","radar imaging","spaceborne radar","radar polarimetry","radar equipment","radar antennas","geophysical equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical equipment","satellite remote sensing","measurement technique","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar","SIR-C","X-SAR","SHF microwave","Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C","X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar","land surface","terrain mapping","spaceborne multifrequency radar polarimetry","X-band","slotted waveguide antenna","mechanical steering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"The SIR-C/X-SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar system","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5047278","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The SIR-C/X-SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar system","sourcePdf":"00406669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03874S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"122","articleId":"406669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":406670,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A decision-tree model was used to formulate rules for a supervised classification into five categories: water, clearing (pasture), aquatic macrophyte (floating meadow), nonflooded forest, and flooded forest. Classified images were produced and tested within three days of SIR-C data acquisition. Both C-band (5.7 cm) and L-band (24 cm) wavelengths were necessary to distinguish the cover types. HH polarization was most useful for distinguishing flooded from nonflooded vegetation (C-HH for macrophyte versus pasture, and L-HH for flooded versus nonflooded forest), and cross-polarized L-band data provided the best separation between woody and nonwoody vegetation. Between the April and October missions, the Amazon River level fell about 3.6 m and the portion of the study area covered by flooded forest decreased from 23% to 12%. This study demonstrates the ability of multifrequency SAR to quantify in near realtime the extent of inundation on forested floodplains, and its potential application for timely monitoring of flood events.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.406675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9135/00406675.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.406675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"896","endPage":"904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delineation of inundated area and vegetation along the Amazon floodplain with the SIR-C synthetic aperture radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Delineation of inundated area and vegetation along the Amazon floodplain with the SIR-C synthetic aperture radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406675/","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5053685","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delineation of inundated area and vegetation along the Amazon floodplain with the SIR-C synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00406675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04426S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"308","articleId":"406675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":406677,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

The algorithm is optimized for bare surfaces and requires two copolarized channels at a frequency between 1.5 and 11 GHz. It gives best results for kh/spl les/2.5, /spl mu//sub /spl upsi///spl les/35%, and /spl theta//spl ges/30/spl deg/. Omitting the usually weaker hv-polarized returns makes the algorithm less sensitive to system cross-talk and system noise, simplifies the calibration process and adds robustness to the algorithm in the presence of vegetation. However, inversion results indicate that significant amounts of vegetation (NDVI>0.4) cause the algorithm to underestimate soil moisture and overestimate RMS height. A simple criteria based on the /spl sigma//sub hv//sup 0///spl sigma//sub vv//sup 0/ ratio is developed to select the areas where the inversion is not impaired by the vegetation. The inversion accuracy is assessed on the original scatterometer data sets but also on several SAR data sets by comparing the derived soil moisture values with in-situ measurements collected over a variety of scenes between 1991 and 1994. Both spaceborne (SIR-C) and airborne (AIRSAR) data are used in the test. Over this large sample of conditions, the RMS error in the soil moisture estimate is found to be less than 4.2% soil moisture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9135/00406677.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.406677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.406677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring soil moisture with imaging radars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Moisture measurement","Soil measurements","Soil moisture","Radar imaging","Radar measurements","Spaceborne radar","Vegetation mapping","Radar remote sensing","Information retrieval","Content based retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrological techniques","geophysical techniques","soil","moisture measurement","remote sensing by radar","radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual frequency method","UHF SHF microwave","soil moisture","imaging radar","hydrology","measurement technique","remote sensing","empirical algorithm","scatterometer","spaceborne radar","airborne radar","1.5 to 11 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"Measuring soil moisture with imaging radars","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","accessionNumber":"5053687","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring soil moisture with imaging radars","sourcePdf":"00406677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045898S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"678","articleId":"406677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":406681,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Application of genetic concepts involves the classification of well log data into different lithofacies groups, followed by a facies-by-facies description of rock properties such as porosity and permeability. This work contrasts the genetic and nongenetic approaches in predicting porosity values of an oil well using backpropagation neural network methods. The performance of both methods are critically evaluated. A systematic technique to optimise the network configuration using weight visualization curves is proposed, thereby enabling the amount of training time to be significantly reduced. In the example problem, the genetic approach provides superior porosity estimates to that based on a nongenetic approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.406683","startPage":"971","endPage":"980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/9135/00406683.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.406683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved technique in porosity prediction: a neural network approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Genetics","Petroleum","Permeability","Australia","Geology","Hydrocarbon reservoirs","Fluid flow","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["petroleum industry","geophysical prospecting","geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","geophysical signal processing","feedforward neural nets","backpropagation","porosity","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","geology","petroleum","prospecting","oil reservoir","geophysics computing","well logging","feedforward neural net","neural network","porosity prediction","genetic reservoir characterization","fluid flow properties","hydrocarbon reserve","classification","well log data","lithofacies group","facies-by-facies description","permeability","genetic algorithm","oil well u","backpropagation","weight visualization curv"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","displayDocTitle":"An improved technique in porosity prediction: a neural network approach","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5053693","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved technique in porosity prediction: a neural network approach","sourcePdf":"00406683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074572S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"44","articleId":"406683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":406684,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Landsat Thematic Mapper images of Tucson, Arizona, and Oakland, California, were used for this comparison. For the Tucson image, the percentage of matching pixels in the two classification maps was only 64.5%, while for the Oakland image it was 83.3%. Although the test site accuracies of the two Tucson maps were similar, the map produced by the neural network was visually more accurate; this difference is explained by examining class regions and density plots in the decision space and the continuous likelihood values produced by both classifiers. For the Oakland scene, the two maps were visually and numerically similar, although the neural network was superior in suppression of mixed pixel classification errors. From this analysis, the authors conclude that the neural network is more robust to training site heterogeneity and the use of class labels for land use that are mixtures of land cover spectral signatures. The differences between the two algorithms may be viewed, in part, as the differences between nonparametric (neural network) and parametric (maximum-likelihood) classifiers. Computationally, the backpropagation neural network is at a serious disadvantage to maximum-likelihood, taking nearly an order of magnitude more computing time when implemented on a serial workstation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5053694","volume":"33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A detailed comparison of backpropagation neural network and maximum-likelihood classifiers for urban land use classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A detailed comparison of backpropagation neural network and maximum-likelihood classifiers for urban land use classification","sourcePdf":"00406684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036734S","chronDate":"Jul 1995","isNumber":"9135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"251","articleId":"406684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":406709,"authors":[{"name":"Chau-Shen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chau-Shen Chen","id":"37351221100"},{"name":"Yu-Wen Tsay","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Wen Tsay","id":"37622856400"},{"name":"TingTing Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"TingTing Hwang","id":"37270857000"},{"name":"A.C.H.

Iteratively, M.Map maps several subnetworks of a Boolean network into a number of CLBs on the layout plane simultaneously. For every output node of the unmapped portion of the Boolean network, many ways of mapping are possible. The choice of which mapping to be used depends not only on the location of the CLB into which the output node will be mapped but also on its interconnection with those already mapped CLBs. To deal with such a complicated interaction among multiple output nodes of a Boolean network, multiple ways of mappings and multiple number of CLBs, any greedy algorithm will be insufficient. Therefore, we use a bipartite weighted matching algorithm in finding a solution that takes the global information into consideration. With the availability of the partial placement information, M.Map is able to minimize the routing delay in addition to the number of CLBs. Experimental results on a set of benchmarks demonstrate that M.Map is indeed effective and efficient.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.406709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/9136/00406709.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.406709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining technology mapping and placement for delay-minimization in FPGA designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Combining technology mapping and placement for delay-minimization in FPGA designs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5045754","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining technology mapping and placement for delay-minimization in FPGA designs","sourcePdf":"00406709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053982S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"2","articleId":"406709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":406714,"authors":[{"name":"Soo Young Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Soo Young Lee","id":"37384865400"},{"name":"K.K.

However, scan operations substantially increase the total number of test clocks during test application stage. Classical methods used to solve this problem perform test compaction and obtain fewer test vectors. In this paper we show that such a strategy does not always reduce the test clocks or test application time. Our approach is to associate a scan strategy function with each test vector during test generation for circuits with full or partial scan. The paper presents two algorithms to generate test sequences that reduce the number of test clocks required to apply the test sequences. The algorithms are based on: (1) heuristics that determine the need for scan operations; and (2) controlling sequential test generation process by choosing an appropriate target fault. In this paper we define and investigate different scan strategies for full and partial scan designs. We propose approximate measures that can be used for selection of a target fault during sequential test generation. These concepts are integrated into the algorithms Test Application time Reduction for Full scan (TARF) and Test Application time Reduction for Partial scan (TARP). The algorithms are implemented, and their efficiencies are demonstrated by using them for a set of ISCAS sequential benchmark circuits. The experiments show that, in full scan designs, TARF generated vectors require 36% fewer test clocks compared to the vectors from COMPACTEST that produces near optimal test sets. Similarly for partial scan designs, TARP achieves over 30% cumulative test clock reduction compared to the results from FASTEST which produced generally fewer vectors than other ATPG systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.406714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.406714","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/9136/00406714.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test application time reduction for sequential circuits with scan","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Test application time reduction for sequential circuits with scan","volume":"14","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5045760","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test application time reduction for sequential circuits with scan","sourcePdf":"00406714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033447S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"59","articleId":"406714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":406796,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Sung Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chao Sung Lai","id":"37275138500"},{"name":"Tan Fu Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tan Fu Lei","id":"37266503800"},{"name":"Chung Len Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung Len Lee","id":"38190162000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"406796","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406796","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric variables","Electric breakdown","Stress","Oxidation","Leakage current","Electron traps","Nonvolatile memory","Capacitors","Chaos","Senior members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon compounds","insulating thin films","electric breakdown","oxidation","electron traps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical characteristics","polysilicon oxide","silicon polyoxide","leakage current","breakdown field","electron trapping","charge-to-breakdown","N/sub 2/O growth","SiO/sub 2/","N/sub 2/O"]}],"abstract":"N/sub 2/O was used to grow silicon polyoxide.

The framework is divided into servo, interface, and supervisor layers. The servo layer is the continuous robot system and its normal controller. The interface layer monitors the servo layer for sensor or motor failures using analytical redundancy based fault detection tests. A newly developed algorithm generates the dynamic thresholds necessary to adapt the detection tests to the modeling inaccuracies present in robotic control. Depending on the initial conditions, the interface layer can provide some sensor fault tolerance automatically without direction from the supervisor. If the interface runs out of alternatives, the discrete event supervisor searches for remaining tolerance options and initiates the appropriate action based on the current robot structure indicated by the fault tree database. The layers form a hierarchy of fault tolerance which provide different levels of detection and tolerance capabilities for structurally diverse robots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/9145/00406930.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.406930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.406930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic fault tolerance framework for remote robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Robot sensing systems","Fault detection","Servomechanisms","Testing","Robotics and automation","Control systems","Servomotors","Failure analysis","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telerobotics","redundancy","fault diagnosis","servomechanisms","robot dynamics","fault tolerant computing","fault trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fault tolerance","remote robots","fault detection","supervisor layers","servo layer","interface layer","motor failure","sensor failure","fault detection tests","analytical redundancy","dynamic thresholds","discrete event supervisor","fault tree database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic fault tolerance framework for remote robots","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic fault tolerance framework for remote robots","sourcePdf":"00406930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07009S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"135","articleId":"406930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":406933,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

We examine the underlying configuration space and two ways of moving through this space. The first, kinematics-based velocity control, is a generalization of some previous velocity-based approaches. The second, hyperspace jumps, is a purely configuration-space concept.

The emphasis is on passive compliance because a minimum of passive compliance to prevent jamming will always be required even when active stiffness control is employed. Particular attention is given to the large class of robots with nonbackdrivable actuators, where the actuator must be commanded to move, and in which actuator forces or torques are not easily interpreted as end-effector forces and torques. We present a novel framework for specifying the desired end-effector compliance for several tasks in terms of stiffness matrices. We explore whether the desired stiffness matrix of a manipulator can be achieved by using the natural or designed stiffness of the manipulator limbs themselves. Several techniques for adjusting the manipulator stiffness matrix are proposed. Achieving this variable passive compliance allows the attainment of high stiffnesses for fast and accurate movements and low stiffness values for force control. Furthermore, achieving nondiagonal stiffness properties wherein there are force and motion coupling in different directions is shown to be useful to prevent jamming and contact induced vibrations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.406934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.406934","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/9145/00406934.pdf","startPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specifying and achieving passive compliance based on manipulator structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406934/","displayDocTitle":"Specifying and achieving passive compliance based on manipulator structure","volume":"11","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5055104","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specifying and achieving passive compliance based on manipulator structure","sourcePdf":"00406934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030812S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"42","articleId":"406934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":406938,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However, this ability is considerably restricted by the nonlinearities and friction inherent in the actuator-transmission systems of most industrial robots. This paper is concerned with the development of high-performance torque controlled joints and focuses on two basic issues: sensor design and torque control. The first part of the paper describes a conceptually new type of torque sensor that uses contactless inductive transducers. The new sensor provides a substantial increase in accuracy over conventional strain gauge sensors, achieves higher mechanical robustness, and presents lower sensitivity to electrical noise. The second part of the paper presents an analysis of the effect that the manipulator's transmission and structural properties have on the joint torque controller design. Two manipulators with very different mechanical characteristics are used in this analysis: the PUMA 560 manipulator and Artisan, an eleven-degree-of-freedom manipulator currently under development at Stanford. The experimental results obtained with a prototype link of Artisan are presented and compared to those previously obtained with the PUMA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406938/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5055107","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","displayDocTitle":"Design and development of high-performance torque-controlled joints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and development of high-performance torque-controlled joints","sourcePdf":"00406938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037952S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"134","articleId":"406938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":406940,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Synthesis of a robust controller for a robot, including motor dynamics, is essentially more complex than that for rigid-body manipulators. The controllers currently in existence require exact knowledge of both the robot and motor dynamics. The acceleration feedback is needed to form a complete state feedback vector for the third-order dynamic system. In this paper, an adaptive controller is proposed, which is able to deal with uncertainties in both the robot and the motor dynamics. An adaptive nonlinear observer is designed to observe the acceleration instead of measuring it by feedback. The closed-loop system is proved to be globally stable in the Lyapunov sense.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.406946","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/9145/00406946.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.406946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"612","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of robotic manipulators including motor dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=406946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of robotic manipulators including motor dynamics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406946/","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of robotic manipulators including motor dynamics","sourcePdf":"00406946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046807S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"43","articleId":"406946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":406993,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The system unifies a diverse base of design knowledge required for mixed analog and digital circuits and covers the design process from specification to mask layout for a variety of configurations. A hierarchical design estimation approach was used to guide system development, allowing designers to quickly estimate performance at a high level of abstraction and to update these estimates as the design progresses. At lower levels of abstraction, architecture templates are used to encapsulate information about particular filter implementations and to simplify the design process. Designers use performance estimates to guide the design process and to make the critical decisions about the choice of algorithm and architecture. Accurate simulation models have been integrated into the design system to allow examination and verification. Results from a 14-b signal acquisition module are presented to illustrate use of the tools and the typical tradeoffs faced at different levels of abstraction. This system illustrates how various design automation techniques can be combined to provide better optimization for a complex system design and to shorten design cycles for custom converters to a matter of days.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.406993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.406993","startPage":"345","endPage":"354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/9148/00406993.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design system for on-chip oversampling A/D interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A design system for on-chip oversampling A/D interfaces","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5049778","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406993/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design system for on-chip oversampling A/D interfaces","sourcePdf":"00406993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048876S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","articleId":"406993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":406994,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper presents a novel constraint-driven methodology to support system-level design. The software assists a designer or a tool in partitioning behavioral specifications onto multiple VLSI chips and in system design while satisfying hard constraints such as individual chip areas, chip pin counts, system throughput (inverse of system initiation interval) and system latency (delay). The software uses search and estimation techniques to perform comprehensive design-space exploration and evaluates partitions supplied by the user or by other synthesis software. The technique determines what design characteristics each partition must possess in order to satisfy area, pin, throughput and latency constraints.

We present a framework for the efficient and accurate estimation of average power dissipation in sequential circuits. Switching activity is the primary cause of power dissipation in CMOS circuits. Accurate switching activity estimation for sequential circuits is considerably more difficult than that for combinational circuits, because the probability of the circuit being in each of its possible states has to be calculated. The Chapman-Kolmogorov equations can be used to compute the exact state probabilities in steady state. However, this method requires the solution of a linear system of equations of size 2/sup N/ where N is the number of flip-flops in the machine. We describe a comprehensive framework for exact and approximate switching activity estimation in a sequential circuit. The basic computation step is the solution of a nonlinear system of equations which is derived directly from a logic realization of the sequential machine. Increasing the number of variables or the number of equations in the system results in increased accuracy. For a wide variety of examples, we show that the approximation scheme is within 1-3% of the exact method, but is orders of magnitude faster for large circuits. Previous sequential switching activity estimation methods can have significantly greater inaccuracies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.406998","startPage":"404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/9148/00406998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.406998","endPage":"416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power estimation methods for sequential logic circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/406998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Power estimation methods for sequential logic circuits","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5049783","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power estimation methods for sequential logic circuits","sourcePdf":"00406998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065544S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"72","articleId":"406998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":407017,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The interpretation of such measurements aims at extracting from the measured data information about insulation defects which then are used for estimating the risk of insulation failure of the equipment. Because the physical understanding of PD has made substantial progress in the last decade, it can now be exploited to support interpretation. In this paper a concept is presented which merges the available physical knowledge about various PD types into a generalized model which can be applied to arbitrary insulation defects. This approach will be restricted to PD of the streamer type in gases and at gas-insulator interfaces which cover a large fraction of the cases encountered in technical insulation systems. The generalized model allows us to derive approximate relations between defect characteristics, insulation design parameters and test conditions on one side, and measurable PD characteristics on the other. The inversion of these relations yields rules for extracting defect information from the PD data. The application of the generalized model is illustrated by two simple examples, namely, spherical voids in an insulator and electrode protrusions in SF/sub 6/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.407017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.407017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9149/00407017.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized approach to partial discharge modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A generalized approach to partial discharge modeling","volume":"2","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5081545","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407017/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized approach to partial discharge modeling","sourcePdf":"00407017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052248S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"469","articleId":"407017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":407018,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It has been established that the form or shape of a breakdown current pulse is very much determined by the overvoltage developed across the gap. Large overvoltages lead to intense space charge effects, which appreciably modify the breakdown current pulse form, leading to more rapid rise times, greater peak current amplitudes and reduced pulse widths. In so far as the overvoltage across a given cavity affects the rise time and amplitude of the pulse resulting from a spark type discharge, the response of a conventional partial discharge pulse detector is necessarily a function of the overvoltage developed across the cavity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Electric breakdown","Partial discharges","Sparks","Space vector pulse width modulation","Mathematical model","Shape","Pulse shaping methods","Space charge","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overvoltage","partial discharges","air gaps","electric breakdown","space charge"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overvoltage","PD pulses","two-dimensional mathematical model","spark breakdown behavior","short air gap","breakdown current pulse","intense space charge effects","peak current amplitude","pulse widths","pulse risetime","pulse amplitude"]}],"doi":"10.1109/94.407021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9149/00407021.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.407021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of overvoltage on the risetime and amplitude of PD pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of overvoltage on the risetime and amplitude of PD pulses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407021/","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5081549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of overvoltage on the risetime and amplitude of PD pulses","sourcePdf":"00407021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041993S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"32","articleId":"407021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":407023,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Human experts can discover possible insulation defects in various representations of the PD data. One of the most widely used representations is phase-resolved PD (PRPD) patterns. We present a method for the automated recognition of PRPD patterns using a neural network (NN) for the actual classification task. At the core of our method lies a preprocessing scheme that extracts relevant features from the raw PRPD data in a knowledge-based way, i.e. according to physical properties of PD gained from PD modeling. This allows a very small NN to be used for classification. In addition to the classification of single-type patterns (one defect) we present a method to separate superimposed patterns stemming from multiple defects. High recognition rates are achieved with a large number of single patterns generated by stochastic PD simulations. Our network architecture compares favorably with a more traditional network architecture used previously for PRPD classification. These results are confirmed by classification of patterns measured in laboratory experiments and power stations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.407023","startPage":"578","endPage":"589","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9149/00407023.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.407023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PD recognition with knowledge-based preprocessing and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Neural networks","Insulation","Pattern recognition","Humans","Data mining","Feature extraction","Stochastic processes","Power measurement","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharges","insulation testing","pattern classification","feature extraction","multilayer perceptrons","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PD recognition","partial discharge","knowledge-based preprocessing","neural networks","HV insulation systems","phase-resolved patterns","automated recognition","classification task","relevant feature extraction","single-type patterns","superimposed patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"PD recognition with knowledge-based preprocessing and neural networks","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5081551","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PD recognition with knowledge-based preprocessing and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00407023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035205S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"49","articleId":"407023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":407034,"authors":[{"name":"Sher Zaman Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Sher Zaman Khan","id":"37087157369"},{"name":"Zhu Deheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhu Deheng","id":"37087158532"},{"name":"Jin Xianhe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jin Xianhe","id":"37087157105"},{"name":"Tan Kexiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tan Kexiong","id":"37087156180"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9878"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4135"}],"articleNumber":"407034","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society","url":"http://tdei.sju.edu/deis/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Monitoring","Laboratories","Adaptive filters","Insulation testing","Manufacturing processes","Test equipment","Interference","Frequency measurement","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering theory","insulation testing","partial discharges","Wiener filters","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-line partial discharge monitoring","shielded laboratories","defects","manufacturing process","interference signals","adaptive digital filtering","on-site detection","PD current pulses","HV insulation","sinusoidal noise","Wiener optimal filtering","time-varying self-tuning filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407034","abstract":"The insulation system of HV apparatus deteriorates due to partial discharges (PD). PD tests are carried out successfully in shielded laboratories to verify the insulation quality and to rectify defects left during the manufacturing process. A variety of techniques exists for this purpose. It is also desired to monitor the insulation when equipment is in operation. Unfortunately, the performance of PD test equipment is adversely affected by interference signals. The sinusoidal signals of low and high frequency, due to their correlation, make the measurement difficult and sometimes even impossible. This paper describes the design of an adaptive digital filtering technique and its successful application to the on-line/on-site detection of PD current pulses generated in HV insulation in the presence of sinusoidal noise signals. The technique is based on Wiener optimal filtering theory and its characteristics are investigated. The adaptive filter of this system has a time-varying response and is self-tuning to each low and high frequency noise component. The filter remains active until the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly increased and it can be used for weak PD pulse integration. Theoretical background of the technique and the results of laboratory and field tests are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/94.407034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.407034","startPage":"700","endPage":"707","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/9149/00407034.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive technique for on-line partial discharge monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive technique for on-line partial discharge monitoring","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5081563","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407034/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive technique for on-line partial discharge monitoring","sourcePdf":"00407034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027525S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"26","articleId":"407034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":407166,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The filters obtained are linear and shift-invariant, and can be implemented efficiently by discrete convolution or discrete Fourier transform. The FIR edge detectors are designed such that they have the ability to differentiate the edges and to smooth the noises in a noisy image simultaneously. The proposed first-order FIR differentiators, as compared with conventional gradient operators proposed by Prewitt, Sobel, Isotropic, etc., are much less sensitive to noise; and the proposed second-order FIR differentiators ARE COMPUTATIONALLY more efficient than the popular Laplacian of Gaussian method. The edge maps of noisy images obtained from the proposed first-order FIR edge detectors (1-D or 2-D) are compared with those obtained from the commonly used Sobel operator. The comparison shows that the former is much better than the latter. The comparison between the proposed second-order FIR edge detector and the Laplacian of Gaussian leads to a similar conclusion. Less computation time is necessary for the implementation of the proposed second-order FIR edge detector than that of the Laplacian of Gaussian.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407182","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3220/9154/00407182.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"231 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of edges of noisy images by 1-D and 2-D linear FIR digital filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407182/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of edges of noisy images by 1-D and 2-D linear FIR digital filters","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997193","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of edges of noisy images by 1-D and 2-D linear FIR digital filters","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00407182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033201S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1993","isNumber":"9154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3220","citationCount":"8","articleId":"407182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407198,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result the proposed algorithm exhibits faster convergence rate than previous algorithms and is therefore well-suited for the real-time processing of nonstationary array signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407231","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3220/9154/00407231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9154","startPage":"13","endPage":"16 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming via two-dimensional cosine transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming via two-dimensional cosine transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407231/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997144","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming via two-dimensional cosine transform","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00407231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030383S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1993","isNumber":"9154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3220","articleId":"407231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":407246,"authors":[{"name":"Z.-L.

The acquisition scheme is robust because the near-far problem is alleviated by the cancellation process. Two schemes are proposed. One is based on a one-by-one cancellation, in which the estimated strongest signal is removed from the current composite signal at one stage and never reestimated at the following stages. The signals are removed one by one until the weakest signal is detected. The other scheme is based on a simultaneous estimation and cancellation technique, in which all the signals so far detected are estimated together and removed from the original composite signal at each stage. The latter scheme has a better acquisition performance; however, the former one requires fewer computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PN code acquisition for asynchronous CDMA communications based on interference cancellation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407246","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3220/9155/00407246.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"781 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"PN code acquisition for asynchronous CDMA communications based on interference cancellation","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997325","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PN code acquisition for asynchronous CDMA communications based on interference cancellation","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00407246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03139S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1993","isNumber":"9155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3220","citationCount":"2","articleId":"407246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407248,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The cell consists of a centrally located base station with eight surrounding corner antennas. The mobiles and antennas operate in a TDMA mode and the communication channels employ spread spectrum direct sequence modulation. TDMA combined with the spatial separation of the cell antennas reduces the carrier-to-interference ratio and thereby increases the cell capacity. The capability and cochannel interference for both forward and reverse link of the proposed system are computed and compared with that of the traditional CDMA cellular system. The results show that the capacity of the proposed system in the forward link is increased by an average factor of three over the traditional CDMA cellular system. For the reverse link the capacities of the systems are comparable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3220/9155/00407248.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"773 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined CDMA with TDMA increases the capacity of a cellular communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Time division multiple access","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Spread spectrum communication","Slot antennas","Transmitting antennas","Communication channels","Interchannel interference","Cellular phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","cochannel interference","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","interference suppression","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular communication system","cell structure","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","base station","corner antennas","mobiles","TDMA","spread spectrum direct sequence modulation","carrier-to-interference ratio","cell capacity","cochannel interference","CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Combined CDMA with TDMA increases the capacity of a cellular communication system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997323","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined CDMA with TDMA increases the capacity of a cellular communication system","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00407248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058797S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1993","isNumber":"9155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3220","citationCount":"1","articleId":"407248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407249,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A digital technique is presented for compensation of these modulator and demodulator impairments. Part of the RF signal is fed to an envelope detector. The detector output, along with the baseband quadrature components, is used to estimate the impairment values. The estimated impairment values are then used to compensate for the impairments. Simulation results show that spurious signals can be suppressed by more than 30 dB using this technique. The effect of modulator/demodulator impairments on RF power amplifier linearization techniques is also discussed. The quadrature modulator and demodulator impairment compensator can decrease intermodulation distortion products by 12 dB for the complex gain predistorter and by about 5 dB for the Cartesian coordinate negative feedback method of RF power amplifier linearization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407325","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3220/9155/00407325.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1993.407325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9155","startPage":"447","endPage":"450 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive digital technique for compensating for analog quadrature modulator/demodulator impairments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive digital technique for compensating for analog quadrature modulator/demodulator impairments","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407325/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1993","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4997246","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive digital technique for compensating for analog quadrature modulator/demodulator impairments","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00407325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040247S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1993","isNumber":"9155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3220","citationCount":"21","articleId":"407325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":407327,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper we show, alternatively, that the portion of the dynamics corresponding to the passive degrees of freedom may be linearized by nonlinear feedback under a condition that we call strong inertial coupling. We derive and analyze the resulting zero dynamics which are crucial to an understanding of the response of the overall system.

Together with fine-form reconstruction and primitive recognition, it has to be the main feature of an artificial tactile system. The system presented here is based on a neural network devoted to detecting incipient slippage of a body pressing on a skin-like sensor. Normal and shear stress components inside the sensor are the input data. An important feature of the system is that the a priori knowledge of the friction coefficient between the sensor and the object being manipulated is not needed. The finite element method is used to solve the direct problem of elastic contact in its full non-linearity by resorting to the lowest number of approximations with respect to the real problem.

Our system supports the planning phase of this surgery by allowing interactive visualizations of the cutting planes using a 3D surface-oriented model of the thigh bone derived from computer tomography (CT).

In this paper, a more computationally efficient scheme which will improve the efficiency of the compact QP method-the improved compact QP method -is developed. With the technique of workspace decomposition, the redundant inverse kinematics problem can be decomposed into two subproblems. Thus, the size of the redundancy problem can be reduced. For an n degree-of-freedom spatial redundant manipulator, instead of a 6/spl times/n matrix, only a 3/spl times/(n-3) matrix is needed to be manipulated by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting for selecting the free variables. The simulation results on the CESAR manipulator indicate that the speedup of the compact QP method as compared with the original QP method is about 4.3. Furthermore, the speedup of the improved compact QP method is about 5.6. Therefore, it is believed that the improved compact QP method is one of the most efficient and effective optimization algorithm for resolving the manipulator redundancy under inequality constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1994.407505","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3221/9157/00407505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1994.407505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9157","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1375 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The improved compact QP method for resolving manipulator redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The improved compact QP method for resolving manipulator redundancy","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407505/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4992424","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The improved compact QP method for resolving manipulator redundancy","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00407505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043376S","chronDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3221","citationCount":"1","articleId":"407505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":407570,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The extra degrees of freedom can be used for avoiding obstacles or to optimize certain performance indices like manipulability or task compatibility. Maximizing manipulability keeps the manipulator away from singularities and provides more velocity transmission ratios in all directions. Optimizing task compatibility improves the force/velocity transmission ratios in the specified directions. However, the real time implementation of various optimizing algorithms is difficult because of the need of large computing time. In the present work, robot configurations for an optimum performance index are computed throughout the workspace. These configurations are then used to train a layered feed forward neural network (FFNN). During operation of the robot, the trained neural net outputs optimal configurations in real-time. The neural net captures the gross behaviour of the training data rather than memorizing the individual data, as in a lookup table. Thus its output is smooth and ideally suited for control purposes. We have simulated this approach on a 3-DOF redundant planar manipulator and the results are discussed in this paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1994.407570","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2145 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1994.407570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9158","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3221/9158/00407570.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of optimal configuration for a redundant manipulator with a trained neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407570/","displayDocTitle":"Generation of optimal configuration for a redundant manipulator with a trained neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5010453","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of optimal configuration for a redundant manipulator with a trained neural network","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00407570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039848S","chronDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3221","citationCount":"1","articleId":"407570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":407588,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We describe an autonomous monocular vision system which is used as a feedback signal to control the position and orientation of the manipulator with respect to a dynamic object part of a 3D scene. Without any previous knowledge of the part's placement or motion, this visual feedback would allow a robot to track a pattern in real time. Applications for such a vision-guided robot include 3D object recognition, by extracting 2D image features and rebuilding 3D features. This is performed via rigidity constraint and search comparison in model database geometric inference. Kinematic redundancy is used for general solution of joint velocity represented by the generalized inverse of Jacobian matrix. The problem of redundancy utilization can generally be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. We present a visual servoing scheme using the task function approach in term of 6 degrees of freedom of robot's gripper regulation. Redundancy theory allows to control position and orientation of the end-effector of an industrial robot in less than 80 ms of cycle time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1994.407588","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3221/9158/00407588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1994.407588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9158","startPage":"2007","endPage":"2014 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition and localization of solid objects by a monocular vision system for robotic tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recognition and localization of solid objects by a monocular vision system for robotic tasks","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407588/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5010435","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition and localization of solid objects by a monocular vision system for robotic tasks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00407588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035109S","chronDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3221","citationCount":"4","articleId":"407588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":407610,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It has been considered that the EMG signal is useful for controlling an externally powered upper extremity prosthesis. In these researches, it is reported that the signal processing system using a neural network system are effective for generating commands to the prosthesis because this system is robust on the location error of electrodes. In this paper, a new simple discrimination system using a neural network for EMG and SMA controlled prosthesis are proposed. The discrimination system is composed of two processes: rectifying and integrating EMG signals; and neural network process. The former process was adopted for faster calculation and simpler device than FFT processing. This new process will contribute to the portability of a prosthesis. Moreover SMA (shape memory alloy) actuators were used for designing a prosthesis in order to make it light and compact.

The planning approach, which itself is not restricted to articulated robots, consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. The preprocessing is done only once for a given environment and generates a connected network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). The planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. We show that after paying the preprocessing cost, planning is extremely fast for many difficult examples involving 7-DOF and 12-DOF robots. The approach is particularly attractive for many-DOF robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1994.407619","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3221/9158/00407619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1994.407619","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'94)","startPage":"1764","endPage":"1771 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration space for path planning: articulated robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration space for path planning: articulated robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407619/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5004687","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized preprocessing of configuration space for path planning: articulated robots","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"00407619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033302S","chronDate":"12-16 Sep 1994","isNumber":"9158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3221","citationCount":"31","articleId":"407619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":407675,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this case both the divider and the combiner are Butler matrices (designed to operate over the 1.7-1.9 GHz band). A signal entering one port of the input matrix is divided in equal parts, phased, and amplified by all the amplifiers and then recombined by the combining matrix at the output port corresponding to that particular input port. In this way the failure of one of the amplifiers no longer causes the total loss of a beam or carrier. Furthermore, for coping with traffic variations it's possible to properly apportion the available RF power among the various beams simply making small adjustments of the low level input signals. Finally, being a signal divided into equal parts by the input matrix, lower power amplifiers operating in linear region are required and intermodulation products can be kept very low. The paper describes the design and implementation of various order Butler matrices and MPAs with thick film microstrip technology for cellular DCS 1800 base stations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407675/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4985476","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiport power amplifiers for mobile-radio systems using microstrip Butler matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiport power amplifiers for mobile-radio systems using microstrip Butler matrices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05042S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"14","articleId":"407675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":407687,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Realistically, these frequencies must be determined from measurements of actual or scale model targets. Many approaches have been studied to extract the natural frequencies from measurement, including the E-pulse technique, several variants of Prony's method, and the pencil-of-functions method. Perhaps the most straight-forward are those based on nonlinear least squares algorithms. Difficulty arises with least-squares techniques, however, because of their dependence on initial guesses for the natural frequencies and their tendency to get trapped in local minima. Also, constraints must often be placed on the ranges of the parameters as dictated by the measurement process and the principle of energy conservation. A genetic algorithm provides a natural minimization procedure for implementing constraints and avoiding initial guesses. Early studies have shown that a genetic algorithm provides results equivalent to the constrained E-pulse technique, with much less computer effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985464","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Natural resonance extraction from: multiple data sets using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural resonance extraction from: multiple data sets using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042452S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"2","articleId":"407687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407688,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It was observed that subsurface targets can successfully be classified by using the magnitude of the scattered fields with the offset-VSP setup. The performance of the classification scheme was investigated with three different classification algorithms. It was observed that a neural network used with a distance criterion provided the best performance for this application. Use of the classical Bayesian classifier results in more misclassification than the neural network algorithms. The performance of both neural network algorithms exceeded the performance of the classical Bayesian classifier. The effect of the type of training data on the performance of the classifier was also studied in this paper. Training with a broad range of SNRs results in better classification rates as expected. But classifiers trained at 10 dB SNR also result in comparable performance. This unusual behavior shown by the network in this investigation is valid only for this specific application, and is probably due to the type of data used for classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407688","startPage":"570","endPage":"575 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407688.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network classification of subsurface targets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407688/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network classification of subsurface targets","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"4985463","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network classification of subsurface targets","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024411S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"407688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":407689,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Trial and error procedures are used until a frequency selective surface matches the desired criteria. One way of avoiding this laborious process and obtain a synthesis procedure is to utilize the training capabilities of neural networks. A neural network can be trained to keep changing the dimensions of the metallic strips or patches, their distance of separation, their shape, and the number of layers required in a multilayer structure until the frequency response matches the desired one. In the past, to achieve this goal, the back propagation learning algorithm was used in conjunction with an inversion algorithm. Unfortunately, both the back-prop algorithm and the inversion procedure are slow to converge. Others used \"genetic algorithms\" to solve the same problem. In this work the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is utilized. The Fuzzy ARTMAP is faster to train than the back-prop and it does not require an inversion algorithm to solve the FSS problem. Several results (frequency responses) from cascaded gratings for various angles of wave incidence, layer separation, width strips, and interstrip separation are presented and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407690/","accessionNumber":"4985461","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of the ARTMAP neural network in the design of cascaded gratings and frequency selective surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the ARTMAP neural network in the design of cascaded gratings and frequency selective surfaces","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050205S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"407690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":407693,"authors":[{"name":"L.I.

Planar near-field scanning, whose implementations include plane-rectangular, plane-polar, and the recent bi-polar, has enjoyed particular popularity due to the relative simplicity involved in the data acquisition and processing. The UCLA bi-polar near-field scanner consists of an antenna under test (AUT) mounted to a rotary positioner which rotates about one axis and a probe antenna mounted to a probe arm which rotates about a second axis. The bi-polar near-field measurement scanner's robotic positioning system and customizable motion control software allow great flexibility in the sample arrangements which may be explored. This paper compares bi-polar planar near field measurements acquired using three different sampling arrangements: polar, thinned-polar, and linear spiral. An interpolation/fast Fourier transform (FFT) based near-field to far-field processing technique is applied to each of these sample arrangements. A comparison and discussion of the resultant measured antenna patterns for a waveguide-fed slot array are included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407693","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407693.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"551 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar, thinned-polar, and linear spiral sampling using the UCLA bi-polar planar near-field measurement system: a comparative study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Polar, thinned-polar, and linear spiral sampling using the UCLA bi-polar planar near-field measurement system: a comparative study","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985458","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407693/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar, thinned-polar, and linear spiral sampling using the UCLA bi-polar planar near-field measurement system: a comparative study","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024301S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"8","articleId":"407693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":407697,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparison of the performance of the FDTD, FETD, and DSI techniques on high performance distributed memory parallel computers. Efficient parallel algorithms for each method based on spatial (domain) decomposition techniques is presented.

Because of the computational time and memory requirements associated with these time-stepping algorithms, their application to very large problems has been somewhat limited. To alleviate these computational obstacles, some efforts have previously been aimed at the implementation of space-parallelism-the concurrent computation of unknowns at different points in the spatial mesh using multiple processors-in the FDTD algorithms. For these schemes, however, communication and synchronization requirements have limited the amount of computational speed-up provided by the use of additional processors. This limited potential for enhanced computational efficiency implies that if full exploitation of the capabilities of emerging multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) architectures is to be realized, approaches must be developed which represent a drastic departure from traditional FDTD techniques. The aim of the paper is to present such a computational strategy. Unlike traditional approaches which use space-parallelism this methodology exploits the decoupling mechanism of an eigenvalue-eigenvector (EE) decomposition of the FDTD matrix to allow the efficient implementation of time-parallelism-the simultaneous computation of field values at multiple time steps. The resulting algorithm is highly coarse grain and has minimum communication and synchronization requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407733","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407733.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"383 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-parallel computational strategy for FDTD solution of Maxwell's equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407733/","displayDocTitle":"Time-parallel computational strategy for FDTD solution of Maxwell's equations","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985418","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-parallel computational strategy for FDTD solution of Maxwell's equations","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029093S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"5","articleId":"407733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407734,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

The approach is to use the Yee algorithm along with the anechoic chamber absorbing material boundary condition. In past experience with the CM-5, the authors have found that other analytical boundary conditions such as the Liao absorbing boundary condition do not parallelize well due to necessary communication operations. The core FDTD operations, on the other hand, involve very little communication since the FDTD algorithm involves only nearest-neighbor interactions within the grid. The advantage to using an absorbing material boundary condition is that it requires only a modification of the material parameters at each node and does not require any additional communication. The benchmarks indicate that one can achieve 4.8 GFLOPS performance on a 256-node partition, a factor of 17.8 faster than the same algorithm running on a single processor of the Cray Y-MP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient FDTD simulation of open-region scattering problems on the Connection Machine CM-5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407734","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407734.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"379 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient FDTD simulation of open-region scattering problems on the Connection Machine CM-5","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985417","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient FDTD simulation of open-region scattering problems on the Connection Machine CM-5","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064568S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"3","articleId":"407734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":407746,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

However, successful application of these approaches to pattern synthesis has usually been limited to relatively simple arrays or has required careful, intelligent selection of the optimization starting points dictated by the nature of the optimization techniques used and the functions being optimized. This is because conventional functional optimization techniques are either based on greedy, local optimization methods such as gradient methods or consist of random walk solution space searches. In either case, these conventional techniques are often poorly suited to the task of arbitrary pattern synthesis in 1D and 2D antenna arrays due to the high dimensional, multimodal functional domains involved. In addition, traditional optimization techniques usually require the object function to be, at the very least, continuous and, in many cases to be differentiable, placing severe limitations on the form and content of the object function.

The CP-PASS (circularly polarized printed array antenna composed of strip dipoles and slots) is a type of series-fed array. Both the transmission line and the radiator of the antenna have a simple linear shape. The paper describes the input admittance of a strip element for a CP-PASS. The strip element is composed of a strip dipole and a window which increases the frequency bandwidth of the strip element. The conventional design procedure of this antenna involved an experimental procedure. This is rather complicated for the simple structure. In the paper, the basic characteristics of the window is demonstrated numerically by using the FDTD method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407751.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"309 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a strip dipole with window for a circularly polarized array using the FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strips","Polarization","Dipole antennas","Feeds","Antenna arrays","Slot antennas","Transmission line antennas","Shape","Admittance","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","antenna feeds","dipole antenna arrays","microstrip antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","slot antenna arrays","electric admittance","antenna theory","linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strip dipole","window","circularly polarized array","FDTD method","CP-PASS","circularly polarized printed array antenna","slots","series-fed array","transmission line","input admittance","frequency bandwidth","design procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a strip dipole with window for a circularly polarized array using the FDTD method","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4985400","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a strip dipole with window for a circularly polarized array using the FDTD method","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040798S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"407751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":407765,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

All multiple scattering effects, which can be significant in a sharply-varying medium, are included. The significance of this algorithm is that it works even in the presence of time and frequency support-limited noise or interference, as long as a single noise free wavelet component can be isolated (we can also switch from one scale to another). This differs from previous approaches, in which noise filtering is restricted to Fourier domain filtering. The added freedom of choice of the wavelet basis function makes it much easier to isolate a noise-free wavelet component; one such suffices to reconstruct the medium. Alternatively, if a noise-free wavelet component cannot be found, orthogonality of the wavelet components allows different noisy reconstructed permittivities to be combined to yield less-noisy reconstructed permittivities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407794","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9159/00407794.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9159","startPage":"12","endPage":"15 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of layered one-dimensional dielectric media using the wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of layered one-dimensional dielectric media using the wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407794/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4979543","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of layered one-dimensional dielectric media using the wavelet transform","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024043S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"1","articleId":"407794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":407821,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The first of these, designated as the conventional design, utilizes several parallel L-C circuits that are initially placed along the monopole such that the effective electrical length of the antenna remains approximately one-quarter wavelength over the frequency range of interest. This method is based upon a two step procedure: (1) design a loaded antenna that meets the gain requirements; and, (2) devise its matching network to obtain the desired VSWR. The second method uses a genetic algorithm to design both the loaded monopole and the matching network simultaneously in an optimal manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407853","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1293 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9160","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9160/00407853.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of ultra-broadband loaded monopoles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407853/","displayDocTitle":"Design of ultra-broadband loaded monopoles","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4992200","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of ultra-broadband loaded monopoles","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028444S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"12","articleId":"407853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":407859,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

There are a number of troublesome resonances that plague these arrays. These resonances disrupt the otherwise wide-bandwidth performance of the arrays. Using a simulation method developed by Schaubert (see Univ. of Massachusetts Antenna Lab. Report, 1992), the operation and troublesome behavior of notch antenna arrays are studied.

This paper demonstrates that the SIM is more general, and executes faster than either the banded Jacobi or conjugate gradient techniques. First, the banded Jacobi solution method was implemented in an object oriented C++ program based on the well known NEC2 program and results were compared to the SIM method for a grid example obtained from the GEMACS documentation of Kadlec and Coffey (1983). Secondly, the SIM was compared to the conjugated gradient method by simulating a generic missile case for which previous results were obtained by Davidson (see PHD thesis, University of Stellenbosch, 1991). The SIM is shown to be computationally faster than both of these methods. The improved speed of the SIM, combined with the very general nature of this solution technique, makes it an attractive choice for the solution of MoM problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407879","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1184 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9160","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9160/00407879.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Jacobian matrices","Sparse matrices","Gradient methods","Convergence","Message-oriented middleware","Africa","Documentation","Object oriented modeling","Missiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse matrices","conjugate gradient methods","Jacobian matrices","missiles","method of moments","convergence of numerical methods","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient techniques","banded Jacobi method","object oriented C++ program","NEC2 program","SIM method","GEMACS documentation","missile","computation speed","MoM problems","sparse iterative method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparing the sparse iterative method (SIM) with the banded Jacobi and conjugate gradient techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407879/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4992174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing the sparse iterative method (SIM) with the banded Jacobi and conjugate gradient techniques","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028845S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"1","articleId":"407879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":407884,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The total number of, method of moments, simulations has been limited by using a rational function approximation based on derivative information of that quantity. This technique was used in order to obtain the far-field or induced current of antenna or scattering problems. Little has been done or published on adaptive frequency sampling, i.e. an algorithm for selecting additional frequencies in regions where the approximation exceeds some error measure, and for maximising the information provided by each new sample point. We propose general scheme based on the residual errors of the derivatives. The applicability of this scheme is illustrated with some well chosen examples.

However, the generation of higher order modes makes it difficult to estimate the frequency dependent characteristics by the above technique. This problem also occurs in analyzing guided structures. It seems to be important to predict the s-parameters accurately even if there are higher order modes. Chu and Chaudhuri (1990) have proposed a technique to extract the modal parameters from the FD-TD results in the analysis of dielectric waveguide problems. However, the technique seems to be able to be used in the steady state. Dehler et al. (1993) also has proposed the technique to obtain the scattering matrix considering multiple modes. However, concrete results have not been shown. In the present paper, a new technique for overcoming the above problem is described. The technique consists of common Fourier transforms and Prony's method. In this technique, first, the Fourier transforms are carried out to transform the time domain data to frequency domain data at each spatial observing point, and next, Prony's method is used to separate modes by using the previously obtained Fourier transformed values at the several observation points spatially distributed. In the technique, whole fields values over a waveguide cross section are not needed, but only values at one point have to be considered. The technique can be applied to systems including an arbitrary number of modes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9160","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1135 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9160/00407891.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of the higher order modes in transforming time dependent data to frequency dependent data in the time domain simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the higher order modes in transforming time dependent data to frequency dependent data in the time domain simulation","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4992162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the higher order modes in transforming time dependent data to frequency dependent data in the time domain simulation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031264S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"4","articleId":"407891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":407929,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Therefore, short circuit microstrip antennas are widely used because the short circuit antenna can realize the same resonant frequency, at about half the size of the standard microstrip antenna. The shorted microstrip antenna is constructed by short-circuiting the zero potential plane of an ordinary microstrip antenna excited with a dominant mode. Physically, this short circuit may be complete, by wrapping a copper strip around the edge of the antenna, or it may be simulated by shorting posts. From the manufacturing point of view, construction of shorting posts is much easier than wrapping a copper strip around the edge of the antenna. In the present paper, the effect of such shorting posts on the performance of the microstrip antenna is studied experimentally. However, the effect of the shorting posts depends on different parameters like the number of the posts, the radius of each post and the thickness of the microstrip antenna which determines the length of the posts. The effect of each of these parameters is investigated and presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.407972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.407972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9160","startPage":"794","endPage":"797 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9160/00407972.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=407972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Resonant frequency","RLC circuits","Copper","Transmission line antennas","Wrapping","Inductance","Capacitance","Dielectric losses","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","antenna accessories","UHF devices","antenna testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shorting posts","short circuit microstrip antennas","size","design","resonant frequency","zero potential plane","dominant mode","construction","performance","radius","thickness","UHF","795 to 812 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the shorting posts on short circuit microstrip antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4986083","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/407972/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the shorting posts on short circuit microstrip antennas","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00407972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020925S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"69","articleId":"407972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":408058,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

For finite elements, one of the most significant errors arises from the inability of the polynomial basis functions to represent the fields exactly within an element. A plane wave propagating through a finite element mesh will experience numerical dispersion as a result of this error. For practical node densities, this numerical dispersion can be characterized by a cumulative phase error. The numerical dispersion of a time-harmonic plane wave propagating through an infinite, two-dimensional, first-order vector finite element mesh composed of uniform quadrilateral elements is investigated. It is shown that the phase error for the vector finite elements is dependent upon the direction of propagation through the mesh and the electrical size of the elements. In addition, a simple formula is given which is an approximation to the exact numerical dispersion.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408072","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408072.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2099 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical dispersion in the vector finite element method using first-order quadrilateral elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical dispersion in the vector finite element method using first-order quadrilateral elements","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408072/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5004527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical dispersion in the vector finite element method using first-order quadrilateral elements","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027333S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"408072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":408076,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

It is widely understood that a plane wave will propagate along a uniform FE mesh; however, it propagates at the wrong velocity yielding a progressive phase error in the FE solution. This phase dispersion is particularly troublesome for electrically large problems, since it is cumulative and builds up to larger and larger values the farther the wave propagates. In many types of problems, the phase dispersion is the largest source of error. The phase dispersion can be reduced by either increasing the node density of the mesh or by increasing the order of the elements. The magnitude of this error must be known in order to make an informed decision on the appropriate node density and order of element to use. The phase dispersion is studied for first- through fourth-order, one-dimensional elements as a function of the node density. The phase dispersion is shown to decrease rapidly with the increasing order of the elements. The one-dimensional results are indicative of what to expect in the two- and three-dimensional cases.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408076","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2083 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical dispersion in the finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical dispersion in the finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408076/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5004523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical dispersion in the finite element method","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017648S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"408076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":408105,"authors":[{"name":"R.

At present, there is a lack of tools for measuring these effects and due to the huge growth of microwave devices, like cellular radio telephones working close to the human body, it is necessary to develop accurate numerical methods for evaluating those effects. Two of the most efficient and extensively used methods are the FFT-CGM (fast Fourier transform-conjugate gradient method) and the FDTD (finite difference time domain method). Since both methods use a rectangular grid, it is interesting to compare the two solutions in order to validate the results. Algorithms for solving the two-dimensional scattering of transversal magnetic (TM) polarized waves by a lossy dielectric objects are presented. At the same time, the SAR (specific absorption rate) of tissues is obtained from the diffracted fields.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408105.pdf","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1883 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The CGM and the FDTD for SAR studies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["User-generated content","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectric losses","Electromagnetic radiation","Dielectric measurements","Microwave measurements","Electromagnetic measurements","Microwave devices","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","electromagnetic wave diffraction","fast Fourier transforms","conjugate gradient methods","finite difference time-domain analysis","telephone sets","cellular radio","electromagnetic wave polarisation","biological effects of microwaves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR","FDTD","CGM","electromagnetic radiation effects","dielectric bodies","numerical methods","microwave devices","cellular radio telephones","human body","FFT-CGM","fast Fourier transform-conjugate gradient method","finite difference time domain method","rectangular grid","two-dimensional scattering","transversal magnetic polarized waves","TM polarized waves","lossy dielectric objects","specific absorption rate","tissues","diffracted fields"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"The CGM and the FDTD for SAR studies","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5004494","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The CGM and the FDTD for SAR studies","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042088S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"408105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":408184,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

To achieve this a certain aperture illumination with progressive phasing is used. The two primary ways to do this are reflectors and arrays. The reflector antenna uses its geometry to create the desired phase across the aperture, while the array employs distinct elements fed with progressive phasing. Reflector antennas are advantageous in the fact that they typically exhibit large bandwidth and low loss. The main disadvantage of the reflector is the geometrical constraint it imposes on the design. The most popular reflector, the parabolic reflector, also exhibits inherently high cross polarization levels. Microstrip patch arrays are lightweight, low-profile antennas that are capable of low cross polarization levels but typically have small bandwidth and fairly large loss at microwave frequencies. The more attractive features of reflectors and arrays are combined in the reflectarray. The steps taken in the design of a microstrip reflectarray using patches of variable size are outlined. Measured and theoretical results are shown for the finished design, and several important performance criteria are compared with the microstrip reflectarray.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408184","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408184.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408184","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","startPage":"1820","endPage":"1823 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a microstrip reflectarray using patches of variable size","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a microstrip reflectarray using patches of variable size","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408184/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998395","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a microstrip reflectarray using patches of variable size","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026943S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"91","articleId":"408184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":408185,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayuan Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Jiayuan Fang","id":"37345299000"},{"name":"Danwei Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Danwei Xue","id":"37358051200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2009-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"408185","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Integrated circuit modeling","Integrated circuit interconnections","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave integrated circuits","Electronics packaging","Distributed parameter circuits","Equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave integrated circuits","packaging","integrated circuit interconnections","transmission line theory","electric impedance","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD computations","finite-difference time-domain","microwave integrated circuits","electronics packaging interconnects","transmission line","characteristic impedance","equivalent circuit model","interconnection discontinuity","FDTD numerical results","numerical solution","ratio","Fourier transformed voltage","Fourier transformed current"]}],"abstract":"The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been widely used in the modeling of microwave integrated circuits and interconnects in electronics packaging.

The authors present a sketch of the image equivalent for this antenna: a single triangular sheet over a metallic image plane. For many years, the TEM horn has been used to radiate and receive pulsed signals. Its performance has been optimized for this purpose by modifying the basic structure described. The design and optimization of these antennas, however, has been largely by empirical means, with no accurate, comprehensive electromagnetic analysis of the complete structure. The purpose of the present paper is to present an analysis, based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical method, for the basic metallic TEM horn and to verify the analysis with accurate measurements. Graphical displays of the electric field in the space surrounding the horn for the times of interest help explain the operation of the antenna and suggest possible modifications for improving its performance.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408192","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408192.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","startPage":"1786","endPage":"1789 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate analysis of metallic TEM horn antennas for pulse radiation using the FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate analysis of metallic TEM horn antennas for pulse radiation using the FDTD method","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408192/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate analysis of metallic TEM horn antennas for pulse radiation using the FDTD method","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043357S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"3","articleId":"408192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":408193,"authors":[{"name":"Dow-Chih Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Dow-Chih Niu","id":"37065608400"},{"name":"B.

In general, trial and error methods are used to design these types of transitions. Some numerical techniques in frequency domain have previously been applied to waveguide transition structures, but the procedure is cumbersome and depends on expensive analytical calculations. The FDTD is claimed to be a versatile technique for analysis of passive microwave structures. The purpose of the paper is to confirm this claim by applying FDTD to several complex waveguide transitions which are not amiable to many frequency domain techniques such as the mode matching method. It is demonstrated that this algorithm is versatile and can be used to analyze complicated waveguide transitions with a high degree of accuracy. Analysis of such structures can be quite complicated in the frequency domain. For example, the plane wave functions are used to represent the fields inside a rectangular waveguide, while the cylindrical wave functions are used for the cylindrical waveguide. As a result, the frequency domain analysis of a rectangular to circular waveguide transition requires careful considerations for proper numerical convergence. Such a problem is successfully analyzed in the time domain by application of the FDTD algorithm to the structure geometry.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408193","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","startPage":"1782","endPage":"1785 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of FDTD for analysis of waveguide transition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of FDTD for analysis of waveguide transition","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408193/","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998386","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of FDTD for analysis of waveguide transition","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039776S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"408193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":408195,"authors":[{"name":"S.

On the other hand, the simplicity and usefulness of the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method are generally recognized. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a method that retains the simplicity of the FDTD and yet provides the modeling flexibility of the FEM. Finite-element time-domain methods have been reported by several researchers; all these methods require solving a system of linear algebraic equations for each time-step. While the matrix equation is very sparse and can be solved for using the preconditioned conjugate-gradient method, it is desirable to eliminate the memory storage and CPU required for the matrix solution entirely. Thus, the present authors give an explicit finite-difference time-domain method using Whitney 2-form elements. A simple 2D parallel-plate waveguide and a 3D rectangular waveguide are used as illustrative examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An explicit finite-difference time-domain method using Whitney elements","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408196","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408196.pdf","startPage":"1768","endPage":"1771 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"An explicit finite-difference time-domain method using Whitney elements","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998383","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An explicit finite-difference time-domain method using Whitney elements","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0384S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"8","articleId":"408196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":408212,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Progress in biological applications proceeded with a method to simulate the frequency dependence of biological tissues while using a time domain method. However, the formulation for even a relatively straightforward problem proved to be extremely complicated. Progress in optical simulation proceeded when the ability to simulate non-linear materials was developed. However, these methods usually involved inserting an iterative procedure to allow for the non-linearity, making the formulation cumbersome, and substantially adding to the computation time. It has been found that both of these obstacles, the simulation of dispersive materials for biological application, and the simulation of non-linear materials for optical applications, can be addressed more easily by formulating the Maxwell's equations as a digital filtering problem, and then using concepts from Z transform theory to implement the solution into an FDTD algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408226","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408226.pdf","startPage":"1450","endPage":"1453 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of Z transform theory for numerical simulation of dispersive and non-linear materials with the FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408226/","displayDocTitle":"The use of Z transform theory for numerical simulation of dispersive and non-linear materials with the FDTD method","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998353","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of Z transform theory for numerical simulation of dispersive and non-linear materials with the FDTD method","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036635S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","citationCount":"1","articleId":"408226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":408227,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Higher order boundary conditions give better performance when used in conjunction with pulse type sources. Unfortunately, they are less efficient when applied to scattering problems as shown by Blaschak and Kriegsmann (1988). This suggests that the current one-way wave equation approximations are overlooking an important aspect of the problem. We believe that the problem resides in the inability of the higher order approximations to deal with the evanescent part of the field. Since this evanescent part is much more prominent in scattering type problems, especially at low frequencies, this would explain the apparent failure of the higher order conditions in those cases. We propose a boundary condition that takes into account evanescent as well as non-evanescent plane waves and prove that this new RBC gives excellent results in both scattering and pulse-type problems. We restrict ourselves to two-dimensional problems but our approach can be extended to 3D problems as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New radiation boundary condition for the finite difference time domain method","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.1994.408231","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/3222/9161/00408231.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1433 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1994.408231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"New radiation boundary condition for the finite difference time domain method","conferenceDate":"20-24 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4998348","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New radiation boundary condition for the finite difference time domain method","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03327S","chronDate":"20-24 June 1994","isNumber":"9161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3222","articleId":"408231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":408233,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A method of exploiting the spatial properties of the multipath environment using multiple element antenna arrays is proposed. Both array vectors and time structure of the multipath channel are estimated using the special code structure of CDMA systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna arrays for CDMA systems with multipath","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408593","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3223/9167/00408593.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"628 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Antenna arrays for CDMA systems with multipath","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5026781","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna arrays for CDMA systems with multipath","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034874S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","citationCount":"16","articleId":"408593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":408606,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Transmitters choose spreading codes based on the type of message they are transmitting, and receivers listen to codes corresponding to the type of message they are interested in. The performance of this approach can exceed that of both receiver-directed codes or broadcast codes in environments where there are several multicast groups (in which a given message is of interest to more than one node), or where it is difficult to know what types of messages (out of a fixed set of message types) a receiver is interested in at any particular time.

A. M. Saleh (1981). The VA detector is compared with integrate-and-dump (I&D) detection and a simplified metric calculation for the VA.

Narrowband meteor burst networks have succesfully supported networks of up to a few hundred nodes on a single channel by relying on the natural spatial multiplexing of the meteor channel to support communications. For large high-density meteor-burst networks, however, this spatial multiplexing can fail to provide adequate diversity to avoid collisions. A spread spectrum system can accommodate many thousands of nodes, and through a combination of channel propagation delay and the introduction of random time offsets operate with a single common spreading code. Throughput and waiting time predictions for such a system are illustrated as a function of the number of simultaneous users, network size, bandwidth, and signal level differences between users. It is shown that a spread spectrum system can accommodate very large networks and provide several orders of magnitude improvement over a conventional single channel system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408635/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5026739","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Direct sequence CDMA for large meteor burst networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct sequence CDMA for large meteor burst networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070955S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","articleId":"408635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":408665,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

It is demonstrated via simulation that the transform domain processor utilizing the computationally simple least mean square (LMS) algorithm is capable of convergence speeds which rival the more expensive to implement least squares methods. Furthermore, there is no additional cost in terms of the adaptive coefficient requirements (and only a modest increase in non-adaptive computational requirements) when compared to the standard tapped-delay-line (TDL) structure array utilizing the LMS algorithm. This performance increase provides a quicker approach to the optimal steady state solution, and is therefore more robust to a non-stationary environment than the corresponding TDL structure LMS processor. The flexibility of this new structure will permit both 'block' and 'sample' filter operations and is therefore proposed for the implementation of wavelet filters and generalized multirate filter banks. The results are equally valid for other array forms (such as unconstrained nonlinear arrays), for space-based Multiple Beam Antennas (MBAs) in satellite communications, and for other applications such as radar and sonar adaptive nulling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5026856","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity adaptive structures for jam-resistant satellite communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity adaptive structures for jam-resistant satellite communications","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057628S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","citationCount":"4","articleId":"408665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":408669,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

The optimal windowed recursive least squares (OW-RLS) algorithm developed previously (1993) results in a significant improvement over an exponential windowed recursive least squares algorithm when it is applied to tracking a fading channel. The improvement is confirmed by simulation on a single path fading channel. However, no improvement in performance has been obtained in the simulation of multipath frequency selective channels. This paper shows that the undesirable result is caused by an additional error which is introduced by an incomplete decoupling of cross-correlation terms. The authors design a feedback decoupling method which can cancel the bias almost completely. Simulations show that the theoretical improvement of an OW-RLS algorithm on a fading multipath channel can be completely recovered. With this modification, an enhanced OW-RLS algorithm is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9168","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3223/9168/00408670.pdf","endPage":"1007 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced optimal windowed RLS algorithm for fading multipath channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408670","startPage":"1003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced optimal windowed RLS algorithm for fading multipath channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408670/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5026851","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced optimal windowed RLS algorithm for fading multipath channel estimation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046254S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","citationCount":"4","articleId":"408670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":408676,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

It has been suggested that CDMA be used as a multiple access method for satellite systems as well, in particular for multi-spot beam Low Earth Orbit Satellites (LEOS). One is tempted to argue that since CDMA works well on terrestrial links, it will nominally work as well on satellite links. However, because there are fundamental differences in the characteristics of the two channels, such as larger time delays from the mobile to the base station and smaller multipath delay spreads on the satellite channels, the performance of CDMA on satellite links cannot always be predicted accurately from its performance on terrestrial channels. In this paper, the authors analytically derive the performance of a CDMA system which operates over a low Earth orbiting satellite channel. They incorporate such effects as imperfect power control and dual order diversity to obtain the average probability of error of a single user.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408676","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3223/9168/00408676.pdf","startPage":"973","endPage":"977 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of imperfect power control on a CDMA system operating over a low Earth orbiting satellite link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408676/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of imperfect power control on a CDMA system operating over a low Earth orbiting satellite link","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"5026845","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of imperfect power control on a CDMA system operating over a low Earth orbiting satellite link","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024095S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","citationCount":"2","articleId":"408676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":408682,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Mean acquisition time approximations of coherent matched filter synchronization in AWGN-channel, continuous and pulsed tone jamming, when complementary codes are used as the spreading codes, are indicated. The idea of using median type filtering as an aiding device for the matched filter is tested in those situations. It is shown that the performance degradation in AWGN-channel is not catastrophic due to use of the median filter. Continuous and pulsed tone jamming can have a very dramatic influence on mean acquisition time if the imbalances of the codes have large values. The influence of continuous tone jamming can be totally eliminated by using a median filter. Pulsed tone jamming can be eliminated almost totally, if jamming is pulsed so that it is on during some whole code periods. Simulations show that the jamming can be eliminated even if the jamming is pulsed in a way that it is on during some chips within every code period.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408713","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"779","endPage":"783 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1993.408713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9168","pdfPath":"/iel2/3223/9168/00408713.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of MILCOM '93 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Jamming","Analytical models","Spread spectrum communication","Filtering","Testing","Degradation","Signal generators","Passive filters","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","white noise","Gaussian noise","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation","matched filters","median filters","jamming","military communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS receiver code synchronization","simulation","DS spread spectrum system","acquisition of code synchronization","coherent matched filter synchronization","complementary codes","median type filtering","performance degradation","pulsed tone jamming","mean acquisition time","continuous tone jamming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the mean acquisition times of DS receiver code synchronization using matched filters and median filters in AWGN-channel and continuous/pulsed tone jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408713/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5026808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the mean acquisition times of DS receiver code synchronization using matched filters and median filters in AWGN-channel and continuous/pulsed tone jamming","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00408713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047648S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1993","isNumber":"9168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3223","citationCount":"5","articleId":"408713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":408714,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The method is based upon the approximation of an expression while it is being computed. The CPU time and memory requirements are reduced drastically with regard to previous approaches, as only those terms are calculated which will remain in the final expression. As a consequence, the maximum circuit size amenable to symbolic analysis has largely increased. The simplification procedure explicitly takes into account variation ranges of the symbolic parameters to avoid inaccuracies of conventional approaches which use a single value. The new approach is also able to take into account mismatches between the symbolic parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4991708","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits by approximation during expression generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic analysis of large analog integrated circuits by approximation during expression generation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00408746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037203S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"19","articleId":"408746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":408767,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Elmore approximation may not be accurate when resistive components of the interconnect significantly affect signal characteristics. An efficient mechanism to compute the driving point admittance of a resistive interconnect tree exists, in which the tree is traversed bottom-up to compute the driving point admittance (DPA). An approximation technique is proposed in this paper which involves traversing an interconnect RC tree top-down to compute the signal characteristics, by exploiting already calculated admittance at every node. A piecewise linear approximation obtained from the analytical expression for voltage at every node is used to compute voltages at subsequent nodes in the tree. The advantage of the proposed technique is efficient and fast computation of interconnect signal characteristics from already computed admittance information. Results comparing the proposed technique with RICE and Elmore on representative RC trees of antifuse based FPGA interconnect are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408767","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9169/00408767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9169","startPage":"109","endPage":"112 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate computation of signal characteristics of on-chip RC interconnect trees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate computation of signal characteristics of on-chip RC interconnect trees","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408767/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4991729","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate computation of signal characteristics of on-chip RC interconnect trees","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00408767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043189S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"1","articleId":"408767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":408768,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

It is the first model that allows computation of optimal obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner trees in time corresponding to the instance size (the number of terminals and obstacle border segments) rather than the size of the routing area. For the most common multi-terminal critical nets-those with three or four terminals-we observe that optimal trees can be computed as efficiently as good heuristic trees, and present algorithms that do so. For nets with five or more terminals, we present algorithms that heuristically compute obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees.

Each analysis and synthesis filter in this filter bank has linear phase. We can design the system to have approximate reconstruction property (pseudo-QMF system) or perfect reconstruction property (PR system). The filter bank is paraunitary in the PR case. Although there are 2M channels in the new system, the cost (in terms of design and implementation complexity) is comparable to that of an M channel system. Correspondingly, the coding gain of the new system is also comparable to that of a traditional M channel system (rather than a 2M channel system). Examples will be given to demonstrate that very good attenuation characteristics can be obtained with the new system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408894","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9170/00408894.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear phase cosine modulated maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408894/","displayDocTitle":"Linear phase cosine modulated maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5004409","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear phase cosine modulated maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00408894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046952S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"6","articleId":"408894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":408912,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Hi Chang","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Hi Chang","id":"37086967053"},{"name":"Jinwoong Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinwoong Kim","id":"37087251735"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"408912","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Scattering","Pipeline processing","Prototypes","Stability","Transfer functions","Quantization","Clustering algorithms","Clocks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","recursive filters","circuit stability","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined recursive digital filters","clustered look-ahead","scattered look-ahead","minimum augmented pipelining","decomposition","stability","quantization noise","overflow nonlinearities","second-order prototype filter","algorithm optimality","filter complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408912","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9170","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9170/00408912.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined recursive digital filters: clustered look-ahead and scattered look-ahead techniques","abstract":"The overall performance of Minimum Augmented Pipelining (MAP) filters, which belong to the class of Clustered Look-Ahead (CLA) filters is extensively analyzed to compare with the performance of Scattered Look-Ahead (SLA) filters with decomposition.

How is this going to happen, what are the limitations, what are the opportunities-those are central questions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9170/00408922.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"136 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408922","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408922","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=408922","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Application software","Microelectronics","Circuits","Content addressable storage","Design methodology","Digital signal processing chips","Societies","Biographies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["teraflop operations","high density computations","floating point operations","single chip processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/408922/","displayDocTitle":"Is it possible to achieve a teraflop/s on a chip?

Single frequency initialisation forces the transient response of the digital filter to reach its steady state at a particular frequency irrespective of the number of processed samples. These techniques are based on deriving an equivalent FIR filter for the IIR type and its associated initialisation processor. The analysis which covers both zero and non-zero frequency initialisation includes the transient frequency responses, bandwidth and stop-band characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5015745","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of digital IIR filters processing finite numbers of samples with single frequency initialisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of digital IIR filters processing finite numbers of samples with single frequency initialisation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026502S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","articleId":"409040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409051,"authors":[{"name":"Shuenn-Der Jean","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shuenn-Der Jean","id":"38148640300"},{"name":"Chi-Min Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Min Liu","id":"37351136400"},{"name":"Chih-Chi Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Chi Chang","id":"38148204000"},{"name":"Zen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Zen Chen","id":"37349754000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409051","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Algorithm design and analysis","Labeling","Computer architecture","Pixel","Systolic arrays","Associative memory","Concurrent computing","Merging","Memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","image processing equipment","image processing","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","digital signal processing chips","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture design","connected component labeling","label-assigning","label-merging","binary image","8-adjacent rule","DSP chip"]}],"abstract":"The component labeling process basically consists of label-assigning and label-merging steps.

This applies, for example, to remote sensing, satellite transmission, and image or speech coding. The practical problem has been how to determine the sampling rate from the data stream on-line. In this work, we give a local time-domain sampling theorem and show how to use it for adaptive control of the sampling rate. After initial sampling and quantization at a high rate, we estimate the required minimum sampling rate from a certain length of the digital signal. By employing an appropriate frame structure for data transmission or storage, we can then set the sampling rate to a minimum for each frame.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409126","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9171/00409126.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of sampling rate using a local time-domain sampling theorem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of sampling rate using a local time-domain sampling theorem","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5015812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409126/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of sampling rate using a local time-domain sampling theorem","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031326S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"2","articleId":"409126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":409127,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yi Huang","affiliation":["Computer & Communication Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Yi Huang","id":"37087159575"},{"name":"Yung-Chow Peng","affiliation":["Computer & Communication Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Chow Peng","id":"37087157526"},{"name":"Chrong-Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chrong-Kuang Wang","id":"37087392915"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409127","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","SONET","Optical amplifiers","Power supplies","Optical attenuators","Voltage","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Power amplifiers","High speed optical techniques","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","SONET","optical communication equipment","amplifiers","integrated circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS limiting amplifier","SONET OC-3","single 5 V power supply","double-poly-double-metal BiCMOS technology","input dynamic range","constant output","long-haul application","active area","optical fiber transmission","postamplifier","power consumption","amplifier layout","common emitter common base cascode structure","5 V","1 mum","2 V","40 km","130 mW","155.52 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork) OC-3 limiting amplifier using a single 5 V power supply double-poly-double-metal 1.0 /spl mu/m BiCMOS technology.

In the tree-search VQ, multiple candidates are identified for on-going search to optimally determine an index of the minimum distortion. In addition, the desired codebook has been reorganized hierarchically to meet the concept of multi-path search of neighboring trees so that picture quality can be improved by 4 dB on the average. In the finite state VQ, adaptation to the state codebooks is added to enhance the hit-ratio of the index produced by the tree-search VQ and hence to further reduce compressed bits. An identifier code is then included to indicate to which output indices belong.

Because of their low costs, high speeds, and low memory bandwidth requirements, the proposed architectures provide efficient solutions for real-time motion estimations required by various video applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9171/00409144.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel architectures of 3-step search block-matching algorithm for video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel architectures","Video coding","Motion estimation","Computer architecture","Costs","Hardware","Bandwidth","Video compression","Computational efficiency","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","parallel architectures","motion estimation","parallel algorithms","pipeline processing","image matching","data compression","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined parallel architectures","3-step search block-matching algorithm","video coding","motion estimation algorithm","real-time motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Parallel architectures of 3-step search block-matching algorithm for video coding","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5027193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel architectures of 3-step search block-matching algorithm for video coding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041634S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"5","articleId":"409144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":409146,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

To obtain a good image of a time-varying object without motion artifact one requires a large number of consistent projections equally spaced in angle. A set of projections are consistent if all the projections relate to the same X-ray absorptivity distribution. This requires that all projections are measured during the same phase of the time-varying object. We introduce a new image reconstruction method based on a priori knowledge of the projections to achieve this objective. This method is implemented on a novel neural network and a new training algorithm is proposed.

The relationship between delay element design parameters and the inherent thermal noise-induced jitter of the generated waveform are analyzed.

The analysis shows that timing jitter is inversely proportional to the square root of the total capacitance at the output of each inverter, and inversely proportional to the gate-source bias voltage above threshold of the source-coupled devices in the balanced state. Furthermore, these dependencies imply an inverse relationship between jitter and power consumption for an oscillator with fixed output period.

Finally, theoretical predictions for overall jitter are compared to behavioral simulations with good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409189.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PLL/DLL system noise analysis for low jitter clock synthesizer design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Clocks","Synthesizers","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Timing jitter","Bandwidth","Phase noise","Delay","Analytical models","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jitter","delay circuits","circuit noise","timing circuits","digital phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLL/DLL system","noise analysis","low jitter clock synthesizer design","analytical model","phase-locked-loops","timing jitter","ring-oscillator","accumulation factor","bandwidth","delay-locked-loops","inverter delay chain","PLL","DLL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"PLL/DLL system noise analysis for low jitter clock synthesizer design","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5038537","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLL/DLL system noise analysis for low jitter clock synthesizer design","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042278S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"81","articleId":"409189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":409193,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung-Wook Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kum-Oh National University of Technology, Kumi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung-Wook Shin","id":"38145136200"},{"name":"Heung-Woo Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kum-Oh National University of Technology, Kumi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heung-Woo Jeon","id":"38140922800"},{"name":"Yong-Seum Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kum-Oh National University of Technology, Kumi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong-Seum Kang","id":"38148316400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409193","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Discrete cosine transforms","Concurrent computing","CMOS technology","Frequency estimation","Two dimensional displays","Kernel","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS process","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","discrete cosine transforms","parallel architectures","computational complexity","parallel algorithms","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","vector-radix 2D DCT","mesh-connected 2D array","array algorithm","parallel computation","processing elements","local data exchanges","concurrency","architectural modularity","architectural regularity","architectural locality","time complexity","canonic-signed digit representation","DCT kernel","double metal CMOS technology","throughput rate","1.5 micron","0.88 mus","50 MHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an efficient array algorithm for parallel computation of vector-radix two-dimensional (2-D) discrete cosine transform (VR-DCT), and its VLSI implementation. By mapping the 2-D VR-DCT onto a 2-D array of processing elements (PEs), the DCT is efficiently computed with high concurrency and local data exchanges between PEs. The proposed array algorithm features architectural modularity, regularity and locality, so that it is very suitable for VLSI realization. Also, no transposition memory is required. It has the time complexity of O(N+N/sub NZD//spl middot/log/sub 2/N) for (N/spl times/N) 2-D DCT, where N/sub NZD/ is the number of non-zero digits in the canonic-signed digit (CSD) representation of DCT kernel. Based on the proposed array algorithm, an array processor for (8/spl times/8) 2-D DCT is designed using 1.5 /spl mu/m double metal CMOS technology. From simulation results, it is estimated that (8/spl times/8) 2-D DCT (with N/sub NZD/=4) can be computed in about 0.88 /spl mu/sec at 50 MHz clock frequency, resulting in the throughput rate of about 72 Mega pixels/sec.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409193","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409193.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"50 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient VLSI implementation of vector-radix 2-D DCT using mesh-connected 2-D array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409193/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient VLSI implementation of vector-radix 2-D DCT using mesh-connected 2-D array","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","accessionNumber":"5043910","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient VLSI implementation of vector-radix 2-D DCT using mesh-connected 2-D array","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027244S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":409204,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

This architecture is more robust against offsets and gain errors than other analog detectors and should operate faster when implemented in the same technology. In addition, it is shown that the Viterbi detector is an adaptive-threshold device with a complexity much less than that of a typical 6-bit A/D convertor required in digital realizations.

By treating the transformations as the evaluation of the Chebyshev series, and exploiting the Backward Chebyshev Recursion (BCR), we can reduce the total number of multipliers (N+1 for IDCT, 2N-2 for DCT). The property of BCR is also used to compute the DCT/IDCT through the down-sampled even and odd sequences. Since the operation frequency for the down-sampled sequences is two times slower, the speed penalty caused by the low-voltage design can be compensated at the architectural level. The total multipliers required for the low-power design is only 2N+1 for IDCT and 3N-3 for DCT. Extension to downsampling-by-4 is also achievable at a reasonable increase in hardware complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409221","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00409221.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409221.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"158 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power and low-complexity DCT/IDCT VLSI architecture based on backward Chebyshev recursion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409221/","displayDocTitle":"A low-power and low-complexity DCT/IDCT VLSI architecture based on backward Chebyshev recursion","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","accessionNumber":"5043937","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power and low-complexity DCT/IDCT VLSI architecture based on backward Chebyshev recursion","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037712S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"7","articleId":"409221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":409224,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Chieh Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Chieh Huang","id":"37536727000"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"},{"name":"Thou-Ho Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nan-Tai College, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Thou-Ho Chen","id":"37348332000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409224","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chip scale packaging","Linear approximation","Read only memory","Programmable logic arrays","Costs","Arithmetic","Degradation","Approximation algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic","digital arithmetic","iterative methods","microprocessor chips","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logarithmic number system","digit-partition","iterative difference by linear approximation","IDLA","LNS arithmetic","32 bit"]}],"abstract":"To design a 32-bit logarithmic number system (LNS) processor, this paper presents two novel techniques: Digit-Partition (DP) to design log/sub 2/(1.x) function and Iterative Difference by Linear Approximation (IDLA) to design 2/sup 0.x/ function.

To define the optimal VLSI architecture, we consider all possible input data parallelisations: from bit-serial to bit-parallel. Then, for each parallelisation, we consider all possible partitions of the lookup-table. For both ROM-based and hardwired architectures, expressions are developed for area and speed, which allow us to have an explicit formulation of the area-speed tradeoff. Then, for given application constraints (inner product size and input data bandwidth), we exhibit the optimal architectural parameters that provide the smallest chip area. Finally, we show that, at any given application constraints, the hardwired architecture provides a smaller area than the ROM-based architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Arithmetic","Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms","Bandwidth","Filters","Digital signal processing chips","Digital signal processing","HDTV","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","read-only storage","digital signal processing chips","high definition television","parallel architectures","parallel algorithms","real-time systems","table lookup","digital filters","digital arithmetic","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time VLSI architectures","distributed arithmetic-based algorithms","HDTV filters","distributed arithmetic-based inner product","ROM-based architecture","hardwired architecture","optimal VLSI architecture","input data parallelisations","lookup-table partitions","area-speed tradeoff","inner product size","input data bandwidth","chip area","application constraints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409237","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409237","startPage":"223","endPage":"226 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409237.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409237/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of real-time VLSI architectures for distributed arithmetic-based algorithms: application to HDTV filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5056669","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of real-time VLSI architectures for distributed arithmetic-based algorithms: application to HDTV filters","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027183S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"4","articleId":"409237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":409240,"authors":[{"name":"Jiun-In Guo","affiliation":["Computer & Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute"],"lastName":"Jiun-In Guo","id":"37277255400"},{"name":"Chi-Min Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, China"],"lastName":"Chi-Min Liu","id":"37351136400"},{"name":"Chein-Wei Jen","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chein-Wei Jen","id":"37267413900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409240","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Discrete transforms","Hardware","Discrete Fourier transforms","Convolution","Systolic arrays","Costs","Chirp","Concurrent computing","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","convolution","Hartley transforms","systolic arrays","parallel algorithms","computational complexity","digital signal processing chips","numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI array design","multidimensional DHT","discrete Hartley transform","DSP chip","cyclic convolution representation","systolic array realization","memory-based implementation","high computing parallelism","low computation complexity","low power dissipation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a general memory-based approach to design VLSI arrays for the multi-dimensional (M-D) discrete Hartley transform (DHT) with any length is proposed. There are four parts of this approach: (1) a new M-D DHT formulation, (2) cyclic convolution representation, (3) systolic array realization, and (4) memory-based implementation. Deriving a new M-D DHT formulation avoids the undesirable overhead required in formal designs. Taking cyclic convolution provides high computing parallelism and low computation complexity. Using systolic array realisation results in high computing speeds and low I/O cost. Adopting the memory-based implementation yields low hardware cost and low power dissipation. In summary the proposed approach will lead to efficient and high-performance VLSI array designs for the M-D DHT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409240","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409240.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"238 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general approach to design VLSI arrays for the multi-dimensional discrete Hartley transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409240/","displayDocTitle":"A general approach to design VLSI arrays for the multi-dimensional discrete Hartley transform","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056672","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general approach to design VLSI arrays for the multi-dimensional discrete Hartley transform","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081162S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"2","articleId":"409240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":409241,"authors":[{"name":"Ping-Tsung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ping-Tsung Wang","id":"37351016400"},{"name":"Kun-Nen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kun-Nen Chen","id":"37349548000"},{"name":"Yen-Tai Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Tai Lai","id":"37277036000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409241","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":52},"abstract":"To overcome the low speed and low density problems in the FPGAs, we must reduce the number of switches used in the routing paths without sacrificing the routability for an FPGA.

The receptor provides a continuous-time output that has low gain for static signals (including circuit mismatches), and high gain for transient signals that are centered around the adaptation point. The response is logarithmic, which makes the response to a fixed image contrast invariant to absolute light intensity. The 5-transistor receptor can be fabricated in an area of about 70 /spl mu/m by 70 /spl mu/m in a 2-/spl mu/m single-poly CMOS technology. It has a dynamic range of 1-2 decades at a single adaptation level, and a total dynamic range of more than 6 decades. Several technical improvements in the circuit yield an additional 1-2 decades dynamic range over previous designs without sacrificing signal quality. The lower limit of the dynamic range, defined arbitrarily as the illuminance at which the bandwidth of the receptor is 60 Hz, is at approximately 1 lux, which is the border between rod and cone vision and also the limit of current consumer video cameras. The receptor uses an adaptive element that is resistant to excess minority carrier diffusion. The continuous and logarithmic transduction process makes the bandwidth scale with intensity. As a result, the total AC RMS receptor noise is constant, independent of intensity. The spectral density of the noise is within a factor of two of pure photon shot noise and varies inversely with intensity. The connection between shot and thermal noise in a system governed by Boltzmann statistics is beautifully illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409266","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9172/00409266.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"342 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive photoreceptor with wide dynamic range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive photoreceptor with wide dynamic range","isConference":true,"volume":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056698","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409266/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive photoreceptor with wide dynamic range","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025386S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"100","articleId":"409266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":409292,"authors":[{"name":"Fung-Yuel Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Fung-Yuel Chang","id":"37287207800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1915-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409292","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Voltage","Integrated circuit modeling","Time domain analysis","Integrated circuit interconnections","Very large scale integration","Deconvolution","Costs","Power system transients","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear network synthesis","iterative methods","convolution","deconvolution","time series","network parameters","transient response","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform relaxation synthesis","active nonlinear terminations","network characteristic models","step-voltage responses","convolution","deconvolution","time series","recursion","synthetic division","Prony's expansion","model synthesis","model parameters","model complexity","transient responses","linear distributed-lumped networks"]}],"abstract":"A novel method for deriving the characteristic models of linear distributed-lumped networks from step-voltage responses is presented.

Negative feedback suppresses nonlinearities by a factor equal to the loop gain. This works well at low signal frequencies, but as the signal frequency increases the loop gain drops. Thus, with a limited bandwidth available, nonlinearities should be suppressed at their origin. In this paper, we consider a major source of nonlinearity, namely the input differential pair (IDP) with a cascode current source, commonly used in op-amps. Then a new and simple IDP with a matched channel-length single-device current source is introduced. We show that the modified IDP is more linear and thus creates less harmonics than conventional ones, and that by satisfying a nonrestrictive condition all even harmonics can be eliminated. Experimental results are described which verify the expected reduction of harmonic distortion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409309","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9173/00409309.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96 vol.5","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel input differential pair for improved-linearity buffer and S/H amplifier design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"A novel input differential pair for improved-linearity buffer and S/H amplifier design","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5063810","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409309/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel input differential pair for improved-linearity buffer and S/H amplifier design","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026688S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":409312,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters offer a response to the last problem thanks to their high resolution. On the other hand, selectivity is often achieved by filtering the received signal at an intermediate frequency (IF). Limitations of A/D converters impose usually an extra IF conversion of the signal to a lower frequency before being able to properly digitize it. We propose a new delta-sigma converter operating directly on the IF signal allowing the design of simple receivers offering both a high resolution and a good selectivity. Undersampling the IF signal allows reduction of the load of the digital section of the receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta modulation","Narrowband","Signal resolution","Receivers","Dynamic range","Analog-digital conversion","Band pass filters","Filtering","Frequency conversion","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sigma-delta modulation","cellular radio","digital radio","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandpass subsampled delta-sigma modulator","narrowband cellular mobile communications","radio receivers","digital cellular systems","selectivity","dynamic range","IF signal","resolution","signal undersampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409380","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9173/00409380.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"356 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bandpass subsampled delta-sigma modulator for narrowband cellular mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bandpass subsampled delta-sigma modulator for narrowband cellular mobile communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409380/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5063875","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bandpass subsampled delta-sigma modulator for narrowband cellular mobile communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029541S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"19","articleId":"409380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409397,"authors":[{"name":"I.

While this error can be reduced to only an offset in switched-capacitor circuits, it produces more severe nonlinearities in switched-current designs. If the input is held constant over several cycles, clock feedthrough errors can be significantly reduced, but for a dynamic input, the ultimate solution has been to use a large sampling capacitor and small-switches. We propose a method of building a highly accurate oversampling current-mode sample/hold circuit using feedback architectures. First, second, and third-order feedback structures are proposed and simulated, with the results showing increased precision as oversampling ratio increases.

However, 14-bit accuracy is achieved by the novel architecture which uses digitally-controlled trimmable current sources and one of two self-calibration schemes to automatically adjust the current sources after power-up or when triggered by an external signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Signal resolution","Educational institutions","Ice","High speed integrated circuits","Calibration","Automatic logic units","Switches","Silicon","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant current sources","digital-analogue conversion","calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed D/A converter","binary weighted trimmable current sources","MOSFETs","LSB current","digital control","self-calibration","14 bit","10 to 20 mA","50 ohm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409412","publicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1994 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9173/00409412.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"472 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel self-calibrated high-speed D/A converter using trimmable current sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel self-calibrated high-speed D/A converter using trimmable current sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409412/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056726","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel self-calibrated high-speed D/A converter using trimmable current sources","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042088S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":409417,"authors":[{"name":"O.

A three-stage configuration reaches a DC-gain of 74 dB in a 50 /spl Omega/ load, while an efficient frequency compensation technique, the multipath nested Miller compensation preserves the bandwidth. Because of the high bandwidth, the noise is kept as low-as 1.2 nV//spl radic/Hz.

By ABST it is meant that there is a unique equilibrium point attracting all trajectories of motion and that this property is valid for all neuron activation functions belonging to a specified class of nonlinear mappings and for all constant neural network inputs. ABST neural networks are best suited for solving optimization problems being devoid of spurious suboptimal responses for every choice of the activation function and of the input vector. A necessary and sufficient condition for ABST has been found for symmetric neural networks of the Hopfield type. In this paper, we show that the concept of ABST can be applied also to special classes of nonsymmetric Hopfield neural networks and to neural models different from the Hopfield one. It is shown in particular that necessary and sufficient conditions for ABST can be found for two interesting classes of nonsymmetric networks, namely, cooperative Hopfield-type networks and composite neural networks with variable and constraint neurons used for solving linear and quadratic programming problems in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9174/00409572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9174","startPage":"241","endPage":"244 vol.6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On absolute stability of neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On absolute stability of neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409572/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5073453","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On absolute stability of neural networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035309S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"23","articleId":"409572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":409574,"authors":[{"name":"D.

For this particular application we introduce several modifications of ART-1 theory for pattern recognition and classification. We show the applicability of a single ART-1-based structure to solving two problems: (a) signal pattern recognition and classification and (b) control. This also facilitates ambulation of paraplegics under FES, with adequate patient interaction in initial system training, retraining the network when needed, and in allowing patient's manual over-ride in the case of error, where any manual over-ride serves as a re-training input to the neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409574","startPage":"249","endPage":"252 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9174/00409574.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient-responsive ambulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Electromyography","Signal analysis","Artificial neural networks","Biomedical imaging","Neuromuscular stimulation","Muscles","Fatigue","Spinal cord"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ART neural nets","electromyography","muscle","neurophysiology","bioelectric phenomena","pattern classification","pattern recognition","medical signal processing","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network control","functional electrical stimulation","paraplegics","patient-responsive ambulation","ART-1 network","spinal cord injuries","above-lesion upper-trunk EMG time series","standing functions","walking functions","pattern recognition","pattern classification","training","manual over-ride"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient-responsive ambulation","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","accessionNumber":"5073455","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of FES in paraplegics for patient-responsive ambulation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035182S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":409577,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Simulation results indicate that such networks can retain nearly identical recall performances as those of the corresponding networks using continuous weights and sigmoid activation functions (SAFs), while having increased computational speed in applications and reduced cost in digital hardware implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilayer feedforward neural network model for digital hardware implementation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409596","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9174/00409596.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"346 vol.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"A multilayer feedforward neural network model for digital hardware implementation","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5079466","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilayer feedforward neural network model for digital hardware implementation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030889S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"1","articleId":"409596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":409599,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Kui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Nova Scotia, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"lastName":"Hong-Kui Yang","id":"37087149889"},{"name":"E.I.

The weighted summation operation (required for a neural network) is realized by switching a weight current, controlled by a pulse whose width is proportional to an input current. This current is then applied to a resettable current integrator. The sigmoid transformation is naturally performed by the nonlinear transconductance amplifier which forms the integrator. This results in minimum silicon area and therefore is suitable for very large scale neural systems. Other pronounced features of the current-mode PWM technique are its easy programmability, electronically adjustable gains of neurons, and modular structures. In this paper, four modules are introduced with which almost all neural networks can be realized modularly.

Elliptic PDE with constant coefficients were considered. A numerical method of discretizing the differential equations on n by n mesh is applied. The partial derivatives are approximated by the difference quotients. When these are substituted back into differential equation, a linear system of algebraic equations is obtained. The n/sup 2/ unknowns of this system are the solutions of the discretized differential equation at the mesh points. The resultant coefficient matrix of this linear system of equations is positive definite. A neural network approach is used. Due to a very regular structure and sparsity of the coefficient matrix, the electrical circuit of the neural network results in a cellular structure which is very suitable for the VLSI analog CMOS implementation. In solving PDE by the use of finite-difference approximations an inherent error due to the discretization technique exists, Intuitively, the accuracy of any finite-difference solution could be increased by decreasing the mesh size. However, the nature of the very solution of the PDE has also an effect upon the inherent accuracy of a finite-difference approximation. Therefore, in selecting an appropriate mesh size, the nature of the function that constitutes the solution of PDE must be taken into consideration. In this paper we will consider how, within the limited size of the neural network, the accuracy of the introduced method can be improved by using a variable mesh size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409600","startPage":"359","endPage":"362 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3224/9174/00409600.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems - ISCAS '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog cellular neural network with application to partial differential equations with variable mesh-size","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Differential equations","Neural networks","Finite difference methods","Very large scale integration","CMOS analog integrated circuits","Linear systems","Partial differential equations","Differential algebraic equations","Matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue processing circuits","cellular neural nets","partial differential equations","VLSI","neural chips","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","elliptic equations","sparse matrices","finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog cellular neural network","partial differential equations","VLSI","analogue CMOS circuit","elliptic PDE","difference quotients","discretized differential equation","coefficient matrix","sparsity","finite-difference approximations","variable mesh size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analog cellular neural network with application to partial differential equations with variable mesh-size","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","accessionNumber":"5079470","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog cellular neural network with application to partial differential equations with variable mesh-size","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039944S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","citationCount":"4","articleId":"409600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":409601,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Analytical formulas and algorithm for training set size reduction are developed and illustrated by two-dimensional data examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409611/","accessionNumber":"5079481","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Minimal training set size estimation for neural network-based function approximation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal training set size estimation for neural network-based function approximation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00409611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030026S","chronDate":"May 30 1994-June 2 1994","isNumber":"9174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3224","articleId":"409611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":409612,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chien Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Chi-Chien Lee","id":"37350992300"},{"name":"J.

The total network size with multilevel neurons can therefore be significantly reduced from a conventional network with two-level neurons. The reduction in network size benefits VLSI implementation. Due to the nonlinearity associated with a neuron transfer function, multiple local minima exist in the energy function of a multi-level analog-to-digital decision network. The procedure for applying hardware annealing by continuously changing the neuron gain from a low value to a certain high value, to reach the globally optimal solution is described.

Application features and neural dynamics are thus carefully analysed to determine quasi-minimal bit requirements for the architectural components. Afterwards, once the hardware design has been defined, sensitivity analysis tools need to be applied to validate effective performances.

Due to a large variety of constraints to be satisfied, the solution space of the UC problem is highly nonconvex, and therefore the UC problem can not be solved efficiently by the standard GA. To effectively deal with the constraints of the problem and greatly reduce the search space of the GA, the minimum up- and down-time constraints are embedded in the binary strings that are coded to represent the on-off states of the generating units. The violations of the other constraints are handled by integrating penalty factors into the cost function. Numerical results on the practical Taiwan Power (Taipower) system of 38 thermal units over a 24-hour period show that the features of easy implementation, fast convergence, and highly near-optimal solution in solving the UC problem can be achieved by the proposed GA approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409691/","accessionNumber":"5010855","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applications of the genetic algorithm to the unit commitment problem in power generation industry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of the genetic algorithm to the unit commitment problem in power generation industry","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07275S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409692,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially as the number of input variables increases. So the fuzzy system with many input variables has extremely large number of fuzzy rules. Hierarchical structure of fuzzy reasoning is one of the methods to reduce the number of fuzzy rules and membership functions. However the hierarchical structure cannot be made without considering the relationship among input and output variables. The proposed method can choose the valid input variables among input variables and organize the suitable hierarchical structure for the relationship among input and output variables. It is based on the genetic algorithm with an evaluation function as a strategy that adopts a system with fewer fuzzy rules and more accurate outputs. The proposed method is applied to the approximation problem of multidimensional nonlinear functions in order to show the effectiveness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409695/","accessionNumber":"5010859","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Structure organization of hierarchical fuzzy model using by genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure organization of hierarchical fuzzy model using by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041973S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"6","articleId":"409695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":409713,"authors":[{"name":"M.

After reviewing the well-known learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks, called back propagation through time (BPTT) and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), we investigate their performance when applied to relatively small-scale problems and evaluate the computational complexity of them. Following these investigations, we apply the recurrent neural networks to large-scale cooling load prediction problems in a district heating and cooling system. However, the computational complexity is enormous and learning within practical time seems to be very difficult. For decreasing such difficulties, we propose a model that preserves output values observed within an appropriate period. Through a lot of numerical simulations, it is shown that the proposed model has an ability to learn long cycle time series within relatively short time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409713","startPage":"421","endPage":"426 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9175","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9175/00409713.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooling load prediction through recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409713/","displayDocTitle":"Cooling load prediction through recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5010877","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 March 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooling load prediction through recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070757S","chronDate":"20-24 March 1995","isNumber":"9175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"5","articleId":"409713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409727,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

However, their knowledge representation power is somewhat limited if they do not allow each proposition in the antecedent part of a given fuzzy production rule to have a different degree of significance. In this paper, each proposition in the antecedent part is assigned a weight, and a fuzzy production rule evaluation method (FPREM) based on point-valued fuzzy sets and weight assignment is proposed. A weighted FPR is preferred over the non-weighted version because it is more flexible. In addition, the advantages of our proposed FPREM are: 1) discrete fuzzy set tables can be used; 2) complex fuzzy relational matrix proposed by Zadeh could be avoided; and 3) the method of calculating the consequent is much easier than Zadeh's compositional rule of inference because there is no need to set up the fuzzy relation between the antecedent and the consequent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409727","startPage":"461","endPage":"468 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9176","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9176/00409727.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A weighted fuzzy production rule evaluation method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409727/","displayDocTitle":"A weighted fuzzy production rule evaluation method","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5005220","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A weighted fuzzy production rule evaluation method","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033471S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"14","articleId":"409727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":409737,"authors":[{"name":"H.O.

Knowledge from cardiologists is used to specify different classes of motion and classification rules. The objective of this approach is to find the decisions for all possible classes of motion in the form of possibilities. The neural networks in the motion understanding system are independent of each other in operation and are cascaded to form a tree structure where each terminal node represents one possible class and each nonterminal node composed of a neural network represents one classification rule. In each network, the propagation rule is described by a fuzzy function and a supervised learning method is employed to train the parameters representing the type of fuzzy logic operation among inputs and the weights between each input and output neurons. Decision values can be computed by applying fuzzy reasoning technique to the outputs of the networks.

Using the /spl alpha/-level sets of fuzzy numbers, the corresponding nonfuzzy /spl alpha/-programming problem is introduced. The fuzzy goals of the decision maker for the objective functions are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions including nonlinear ones. Through the introduction of an extended Pareto optimality concept, if the decision maker specifies the degree /spl alpha/ and the reference membership values, the corresponding extended Pareto optimal solution can be obtained by solving the minimax problems for which the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method is applicable. Then a linear programming-based interactive fuzzy satisficing method for deriving a satisficing solution for the decision maker efficiently from an extended Pareto optimal solution set is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interactive fuzzy satisficing methods for large-scale multiobjective linear programs with fuzzy numbers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409829","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9177/00409829.pdf","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1162 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 March 1995","displayDocTitle":"An interactive fuzzy satisficing methods for large-scale multiobjective linear programs with fuzzy numbers","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5051204","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive fuzzy satisficing methods for large-scale multiobjective linear programs with fuzzy numbers","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038646S","chronDate":"20-24 March 1995","isNumber":"9177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"2","articleId":"409829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":409878,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chia Yao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Chia Yao","id":"37087305157"},{"name":"Yau-Hwang Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yau-Hwang Kuo","id":"37087155697"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2461-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409878","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Knowledge representation","Inference algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Knowledge engineering","Hybrid intelligent systems","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","parallel processing","inference mechanisms","knowledge representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-layered fuzzy neural network model","parallel fuzzy inference","linguistic knowledge representation","matching degree calculation","evidence combination","conclusion making","defuzzification","input layer","premise layer","linguistic neurons","output layer","conclusion layer","rule layer","rule neurons","truth-value flow channel","fuzzy expert systems","clustering phase","rule construction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409878","abstract":"In this paper, a three-layered fuzzy neural network model is developed to execute parallel fuzzy inference with linguistic knowledge representation. Each linguistic variable and its linguistic term set is encapsulated into a single linguistic neuron, which may operate in normal mode or reverse mode. In normal mode, it has the functions of fuzzification and matching degree calculation. In reverse mode, it has the functions of evidence combination, conclusion making and defuzzification. In the three-layered model, the input (premise) layer is composed of a set of linguistic neurons operating in normal mode, while the output (conclusion) layer contains a set of linguistic neurons operating in reverse mode during inferencing but operating in normal mode during learning. Between the input layer and the output layer, a rule layer composed of rule neurons constitutes the truth-value flow channel from input layer to output layer in fuzzy inference. Each rule neuron represents a fuzzy rule. Such a three-layered structure makes a natural representation for fuzzy expert systems, and has faster inferencing and learning speed. This paper further develops a learning algorithm with the advantage of quick convergence. The learning algorithm includes a clustering phase before rule construction, whose results can provide useful information to construct rules by only building necessary links.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409878","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1510 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9177","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9177/00409878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy neural network model with three-layered structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409878/","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy neural network model with three-layered structure","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5039396","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy neural network model with three-layered structure","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409878.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0538S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"3","articleId":"409878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409902,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Chu Chang","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Command, Control, Communications, & Intelligence, School of Information Technology and Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Kuo-Chu Chang","id":"37087218378"},{"name":"Yi-Chuan Lu","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Command, Control, Communications, & Intelligence, School of Information Technology and Engineering, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Yi-Chuan Lu","id":"37087720920"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2461-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409902","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Entropy","Radar detection","Object detection","Neurons","Communication system control","Control systems","Intelligent control","Information technology","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","image classification","object recognition","radar polarimetry","neural nets","vector quantisation","radar target recognition","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution polarimetric SAR target classification","neural network","SOFM/LVQ classifier","ATR system","SAR imagery","orientation","distance discriminator","clutter","entropy measure"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution polarimetric SAR target classification with neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409902","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409902","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1688 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9177/00409902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9177","abstract":"An improved version of the SOFM/LVQ classifier currently used in an ATR system for SAR imagery is presented. This classifier was originally designed to construct a few number of templates to represent a set of targets with different orientations. The classifier accepts an input target data, computes distances of this data with those representative templates, and then classifies this data to the target class with the shortest distance, With this distance discriminator, a good classification performance was obtained when only target data were tested. However, the simple distance measure produces poor classification results when unknown targets such as natural or manmade clutters are present and when each target is represented by a small number of templates. We correct this deficiency by incorporating an entropy measure into the original classifier. With this entropy discriminator, our system rejects a majority of the false alarms while maintaining a high correct classification rate with a relatively few templates for each target.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409902/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5039420","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"High resolution polarimetric SAR target classification with neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution polarimetric SAR target classification with neural network","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060184S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"2","articleId":"409902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409914,"authors":[{"name":"Sun-Gi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sun-Gi Hong","id":"37085975961"},{"name":"Sung-Woo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Woo Kim","id":"37087157186"},{"name":"Ju-Jang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ju-Jang Lee","id":"37087159392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2461-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"409914","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Neurons","Computer networks","Constraint optimization","Circuits","Cost function","Equations","Biological system modeling","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","minimisation","Hopfield neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum-cost path finding algorithm","Hopfield type neural network","constrained optimization","energy function","vector-represented network","local minima"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=409914","abstract":"Neural networks have been proposed as new computational tools for solving constrained optimization problems.

It performs a fuzzy rule-based reasoning to forecast the system performance of the elevator group. The performance tuning function utilizes the forecasting model in order to search the optimal control parameters which give the best system performance in the present traffic situation. The fuzzy neural network applied system can automatically adapt itself to various traffic situations.

It is widely applicable where the behavior of a chaotic system is well described by the next return map. The method appears to be superior to other alternatives since a single ANN trained with time-series data is capable of controlling chaos, i.e., rendering stable multiple unstable periodic orbits embedding a strange attractor, and extensive computation or analysis is unnecessary. Its efficacy is illustrated with an example of a logistic map.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409945/","accessionNumber":"5039452","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Controlling chaos with an artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling chaos with an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055538S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"7","articleId":"409945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":409948,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Each feedback connection has time delay unit while the feedforward portion does not have them. In this study, we have derived several formulae to determine the inner parameters of URAN/sub n/, from the qualitative analysis on its continuous dynamical systems considering the geometrical structure of the stationary solution (or the equilibrium state) and the flow speed ratio of the vector field. By adjusting the parameters in URAN/sub 2/ under constraint of design formulae derived, we have generated chaotic time series using modified Rossler's constraint model. Further, we have found 1/f-like fluctuation in the temporal signal generated from URAN/sub n/. We have also shown an application of this fluctuation for the two-dimensional spatial pattern design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409948","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1970 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9178/00409948.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the architecture of a recurrent neural network as a chaos 1/f generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Chaos","Neurons","Neurofeedback","Fluctuations","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Vectors","Delay effects","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","chaos","neural net architecture","parallel architectures","feedforward","circuit feedback","time series","constraint handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","chaos 1/f generator","unlimited recurrent adjustable network","feedforward","feedback","time delay unit","qualitative analysis","geometrical structure","equilibrium state","flow speed ratio","vector field","chaotic time series","Rossler's constraint model","2D spatial pattern design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"On the architecture of a recurrent neural network as a chaos 1/f generator","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","accessionNumber":"5039455","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the architecture of a recurrent neural network as a chaos 1/f generator","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03969S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"1","articleId":"409948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":409976,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper outlines several techniques for partially overcoming the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional data modelling problems and compares and contrasts them with several algorithms developed in the statistical community. The work is intended to outline both conventional concepts which can be usefully applied in neurofuzzy models and new developments in this field.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409976","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2146 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.409976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9178","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9178/00409976.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High dimensional neurofuzzy systems: overcoming the curse of dimensionality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/409976/","displayDocTitle":"High dimensional neurofuzzy systems: overcoming the curse of dimensionality","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5044727","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High dimensional neurofuzzy systems: overcoming the curse of dimensionality","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00409976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031794S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"37","articleId":"409976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"}]
