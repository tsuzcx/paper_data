These remote laboratories can, under appropriate circumstances, support or even replace traditional (proximal) laboratories, provide additional or improved access at reduced cost, and encourage interinstitutional sharing of expensive resources. Effective design of remote laboratories requires attention to the design of both the pedagogy and the technical infrastructure, as well as how these elements interact. In this paper, we consider the architectures of remote laboratories, the shortcomings of existing implementations, and we argue that emerging internet technologies can assist in overcoming these shortcomings. We also consider the opportunities which these technologies provide in moving beyond both existing remote laboratories and existing proximal laboratories, to create opportunities which were not previously possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210092/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11049945","volume":"2","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evolving Remote Laboratory Architectures to Leverage Emerging Internet Technologies","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Evolving Remote Laboratory Architectures to Leverage Emerging Internet Technologies","sourcePdf":"tlt2009040289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097491S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"5370793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5370793","articleId":"5210092","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5210094,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Hanson","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/5370793/5210094/5210094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ben Hanson received the MEng degree in mechatronics in 1998 and the PhD degree in mechanical engineering in 2002, both from the University of Leeds, United Kingdom.

This paper proposes a positioning solution using received signal strength in indoor wireless local area networks. In this application, an explicit measurement equation and the corresponding noise statistics are unknown because of the complexity of the indoor propagation channel. To address these challenges, we introduce a new state-space Bayesian filter: the nonparametric information (NI) filter. This filter effectively tracks motion in situations where the Kalman filter and its variants are inapplicable, while maintaining a computational complexity comparable to that of the Kalman filter. To deal with the noisy nature of the indoor propagation environment, the NI filter is used in the design of an intelligent dynamic WLAN tracking system. The system anticipates future position values and adapts its sensing and estimation parameters accordingly. Our experimental results conducted on measurements from a real office environment indicate that the combination of the intelligent design and the NI filter results in significant improvements over the Kalman and particle filters.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5392953/05210101.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392953","startPage":"405","endPage":"419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Dynamic Radio Tracking in Indoor Wireless Local Area Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Dynamic Radio Tracking in Indoor Wireless Local Area Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210101/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11071215","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5210101/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Dynamic Radio Tracking in Indoor Wireless Local Area Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010030405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087338S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5392953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5392953","articleId":"5210101","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5210105,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Jana","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5392953/5210105/5210105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suman Jana received the bachelor's degree in computer science from Jadavpur University, India.

The main goal behind using clock skews is to overcome one of the major limitations of existing solutions - the inability to effectively detect Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. We calculate the clock skew of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We use two different methods for this purpose - one based on linear programming and the other based on least-square fit. We supplement these methods with a heuristic for differentiating original packets from those sent by the fake APs. We collect TSF time stamp data from several APs in three different residential settings. Using our measurement data as well as data obtained from a large conference setting, we find that clock skews remain consistent over time for the same AP but vary significantly across APs. Furthermore, we improve the resolution of received time stamp of the frames and show that with this enhancement, our methodology can find clock skews very quickly, using 50-100 packets in most of the cases. We also discuss and quantify the impact of various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization, clock source selection, and NTP synchronization on clock skews. Our results indicate that the use of clock skews appears to be an efficient and robust method for detecting fake APs in wireless local area networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5392953/05210105.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Fast and Accurate Detection of Unauthorized Wireless Access Points Using Clock Skews","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Wireless LAN","Synchronization","Fingerprint recognition","Media Access Protocol","Probes","Linear programming","Time measurement","Temperature","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","least squares approximations","linear programming","synchronisation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unauthorized wireless access points","clock skews","wireless local area network access point","medium access control","MAC address spoofing","IEEE 802.11","time synchronization function","linear programming","least-square fit","wireless local area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11","fingerprint","MAC address spoofing","fake access point","time stamp."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Fast and Accurate Detection of Unauthorized Wireless Access Points Using Clock Skews","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5210105/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11101753","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Fast and Accurate Detection of Unauthorized Wireless Access Points Using Clock Skews","sourcePdf":"ttm2010030449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150232S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5392953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"5392953","articleId":"5210105","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5210106,"authors":[{"name":"Radmilo Racic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5432940/5210106/5210106-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Radmilo Racic received the MS degree in computer science in 2009 from the University of California, Davis, where he is currently working as a security consultant focusing on penetration testing and network security."]},"firstName":"Radmilo","lastName":"Racic","id":"37298553700"},{"name":"Denys Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5432940/5210106/5210106-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Denys Ma received the MS degree in computer science from the University of California, Davis, in 2007.

Under fairness and QoS constraints, they use opportunistic scheduling to efficiently utilize the available spectrum. Opportunistic scheduling algorithms rely on the collaboration among all mobile users to achieve their design objectives. However, we demonstrate that rogue cellular devices can exploit vulnerabilities in popular opportunistic scheduling algorithms, such as Proportional Fair (PF) and Temporal Fair (TF), to usurp the majority of time slots in 3G networks. Our simulations show that under realistic conditions, only five rogue device per 50-user cell can capture up to 95 percent of the time slots, and can cause 2-second end-to-end interpacket transmission delay on VoIP applications for every user in the same cell, rendering VoIP applications useless. To defend against this attack, we propose strengthening the PF and TF schedulers and a robust handoff scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11180423","htmlLink":"/document/5210106/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting and Defending Opportunistic Scheduling in Cellular Data Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting and Defending Opportunistic Scheduling in Cellular Data Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010050609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08429S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5432940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5432940","articleId":"5210106","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5210107,"authors":[{"name":"Ai Chen","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5420335/5210107/5210107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ai Chen received the BS and MS degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides global barrier coverage, making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local barrier coverage to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, local barrier coverage guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of local barrier coverage, even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although local barrier coverage does not deterministically guarantee global barrier coverage, we show that for thin belt regions, local barrier coverage almost always provides global barrier coverage. To demonstrate that local barrier coverage can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called localized barrier coverage protocol (LBCP). We prove that LBCP guarantees local barrier coverage and show that LBCP provides close to optimal enhancement in the network lifetime, while providing global barrier coverage most of the time. They outperform an existing algorithm called randomized independent sleeping (RIS) by up to six times.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5420335/05210107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420335","startPage":"491","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11151992","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5210107/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010040491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10237S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5420335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5420335","articleId":"5210107","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5210108,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5420335/5210108/5210108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao Yu Wang received the MASc degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, in 2006.

This is for a better estimation on the optimal range of spectrum for fine sensing so as to adaptively reduce the overall channel sensing time. Performance analysis is conducted on the proposed EKBR scheme using a multidimensional absorbing Markov chain to evaluate various performance metrics of interest, such as average sensing delay (or referred to as sensing overhead in the study), average data transmission rate, and percentage of missed spectrum opportunities. Numerical results show that the proposed EKBR scheme achieves better performance than that by the state-or-the-art techniques while yielding less computation complexity and sensing overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11151996","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210108/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extended Knowledge-Based Reasoning Approach to Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Knowledge-Based Reasoning Approach to Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"ttm2010040465.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073781S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5420335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5420335","articleId":"5210108","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5210116,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Hofmann","affiliation":["Computationally Intelligent Systems Group CIS, Department of Informatics and Mathematics, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/5692142/5210116/5210116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexander Hofmann received the diploma (master\u2019s degree) in computer science in 2002 from the University of Passau, Germany.

The goal is to identify and to cluster different alerts-produced by low-level intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc.-belonging to a specific attack instance which has been initiated by an attacker at a certain point in time. Thus, meta-alerts can be generated for the clusters that contain all the relevant information whereas the amount of data (i.e., alerts) can be reduced substantially. Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low. In addition, meta-alerts are generated with a delay of typically only a few seconds after observing the first alert belonging to a new attack instance.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2009.36","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5692142/05210116.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"294","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2009.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Intrusion Alert Aggregation with Generative Data Stream Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Online Intrusion Alert Aggregation with Generative Data Stream Modeling","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11759768","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5210116/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Intrusion Alert Aggregation with Generative Data Stream Modeling","sourcePdf":"ttq2011020282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076936S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5692142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5692142","articleId":"5210116","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5210117,"authors":[{"name":"Ramana Rao Kompella","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/5624749/5210117/5210117-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ramana Rao Kompella (M\u201907) received the BTech degree from IIT Bombay in 1999, the MS degree from Stanford University in 2001, and the PhD degree from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2007.

The pace of change in technology often outstrips the pace of introduction of associated fault monitoring capabilities that are built into today's IP protocols and routers. Moreover, some of these new technologies cross networking layers, raising the potential for unanticipated interactions and service disruptions, which the individual layers' built-in monitoring capabilities may not detect. In these instances, operators typically employ higher layer monitoring techniques such as end-to-end liveness probing to detect lower or cross-layer failures, but lack tools to precisely determine where a detected failure may have occurred. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of using risk modeling to translate high-level failure notifications into lower layer root causes in two specific scenarios in a tier-1 ISP. We show that a simple greedy heuristic works with accuracy exceeding 80 percent for many failure scenarios in simulation, while delivering extremely high precision (greater than 80 percent). We report our operational experience using risk modeling to isolate optical component and MPLS control plane failures in an ISP backbone.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2009.37","startPage":"396","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5624749","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5624749/05210117.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Localization via Risk Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210117/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Localization via Risk Modeling","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5210117/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11629938","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Localization via Risk Modeling","sourcePdf":"ttq2010040396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06905S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5624749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5624749","articleId":"5210117","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5210122,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Zhou","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37536452400"},{"name":"Wenwu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wenwu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37538109400"},{"name":"Xiumin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiumin","lastName":"Li","id":"37900267500"},{"name":"Michael Small","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Small","id":"37318278900"},{"name":"Jun-an Lu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jun-an","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278640800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5210122","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Neurons","Complex networks","Biological neural networks","Mathematics","Biomembranes","Electroencephalography","Statistics","Signal processing algorithms","Mechanical factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","complex networks","feedback","Lyapunov methods","membranes","neural nets","stability","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurobiological network","pinning mechanism","network topology identification","membrane potentials","Schur complement","Lyapunov stability theory","exact weight configuration matrix","adaptive feedback control","neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex network","neural network","pinning","topology identification","weight couplings"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Animals","Computer Simulation","Connectome","Feedback, Physiological","Humans","Models, Neurological","Nerve Net","Nerve Net","Neurons"]}],"abstract":"Topology identification of a network has received great interest for the reason that the study on many key properties of a network assumes a special known topology. Different from recent similar works in which the evolution of all the nodes in a complex network need to be received, this brief presents a novel criterion to identify the topology of a coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurobiological network by receiving the membrane potentials of only a fraction of the neurons. Meanwhile, although incomplete information is received, the evolution of all the neurons including membrane potentials and recovery variables are traced. Based on Schur complement and Lyapunov stability theory, the exact weight configuration matrix can be estimated by a simple adaptive feedback control. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is successfully verified by neural networks with fixed and switching topologies.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2029102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5280548/05210122.pdf","startPage":"1679","endPage":"1684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2029102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying the Topology of a Coupled FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo Neurobiological Network via a Pinning Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210122/","displayDocTitle":"Identifying the Topology of a Coupled FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo Neurobiological Network via a Pinning Mechanism","volume":"20","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10909744","pubMedId":"19703799","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210122/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying the Topology of a Coupled FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo Neurobiological Network via a Pinning Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhou-2029102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114361S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5280548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5280548","articleId":"5210122","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210125,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Fraunhofer German-Sino Laboratory for Mobile Communications MCI, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Holger Boche (M'04\u2013SM'07) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.-Ing. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.

Under the conventional assumption of a convex compact utility set, both techniques yield the same unique solution.

Then, we study a scenario where the performance of each user is measured by its signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The SIR is modeled by an axiomatic framework of log-convex interference functions. No power constraints are assumed. It is shown how existence and uniqueness of a proportionally fair optimizer depends on the interference coupling among the users. Finally, we analyze the feasible SIR set.

and Self-Repair Schemes for SRAMs With Static and Dynamic Faults","abstract":"This paper proposes a simple method for enhancing the reliability of static random access memories (SRAMs) with hard-to-detect resistive-open defects. The method prevents a SRAM from executing successive multiple read operations on the same position, such that the hard-to-detect defects cannot manifest as functional faults. This can prolong the lifetime of the SRAM with latent hard-to-detect defects. Experimental results show that the proposed reliability-enhancement circuit (REC) can effectively improve the reliability of the SRAMs without incurring delay penalty and with 0.07% additional area cost for an 8192 \u00d7 64-bit SRAM. By integrating the REC with the SRAM, a BISR scheme is proposed to boost 6%-10% increment of repair rate compared with the BISR without the REC. Also, the area cost of the BISR is low-only about 2% for an 8192 \u00d7 64-bit SRAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210133/","volume":"18","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5210133/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11477341","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-Enhancement and Self-Repair Schemes for SRAMs With Static and Dynamic Faults","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-Enhancement and Self-Repair Schemes for SRAMs With Static and Dynamic Faults","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jli-2022363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097525S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5556483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5556483","articleId":"5210133","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5210140,"authors":[{"name":"Pradyumna Thiruvenkatanathan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5272985/5210140/5210140-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pradyumna Thiruvenkatanathan (S'09) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2006, and the M.Phil. degree in micro- and nanotechnology enterprise from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Engineering.","He has been a member of Churchill College, University of Cambridge, since 2006, where he is also with the Nanoscience Centre.

Theoretical studies show that measuring the variation in eigenstates due to such vibration-mode localization can yield orders of magnitude enhancement in signal sensitivity over the technique of simply measuring induced resonant-frequency shifts. In this paper, we propose the application of mode localization for detecting small perturbations in stiffness in pairs of nearly identical weakly coupled microelectromechanical-system resonators and also examine the effect of initial mechanical asymmetry caused by fabrication tolerances in such sensors. For the first time, the variation in eigenstates is studied by coupling the resonators using electrostatic means that allow for significantly weaker coupling-spring constants and the possibility for stronger localization of vibration modes. Eigenstate variations that are nearly three orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding shifts in the resonant frequency for an induced perturbation in stiffness are experimentally demonstrated. Such high electrically tunable parametric sensitivities, together with the added advantage of intrinsic common-mode rejection, pave the way to a new paradigm of mechanical sensing.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2025999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272985","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1086","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5272985/05210140.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2025999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Parametric Sensitivity in Electrically Coupled MEMS Resonators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Micromechanical devices","Vibration measurement","Resonance","Resonant frequency","Springs","Mechanical sensors","Councils","Fabrication","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromechanical resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric sensitivity enhancement","electrically coupled MEMS resonators","structural properties","coupled oscillations","vibration mode localization","induced resonant-frequency shifts","initial mechanical asymmetry","eigenstates","intrinsic common-mode rejection","mechanical sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrical coupling","mode localization","parametric sensitivity","resonators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Parametric Sensitivity in Electrically Coupled MEMS Resonators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5210140/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10881512","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Parametric Sensitivity in Electrically Coupled MEMS Resonators","sourcePdf":"jmems-seshia-2025999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070113S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5272985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5272985","articleId":"5210140","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5210141,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5356246/5210141/5210141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xudong Chen (M\u201909) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2005.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Its important features are reduced voltage stress across the chopper switches, possible reduction in the chopper switching frequency, improved reliability, and ride-through capability enhancement. This topology is analyzed using three- and four-level flying-capacitor-based chopper circuit configurations. These configurations are different in capacitor and semiconductor device count and correspondingly reduce the device voltage stresses by half and one-third, respectively. The detailed working principles and control schemes for these circuits are presented. It is shown that, by preferentially selecting the available chopper switch states, the dc-link capacitor voltages can be efficiently equalized in addition to having tightly regulated flying-capacitor voltages around their references. The various operating modes of the chopper are described along with their preferential selection logic to achieve the desired performances. The performance of the proposed chopper and corresponding control schemes are confirmed through both simulation and experimental investigations.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5483249/05210147.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5483249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029527","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2261","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2029527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Flying-Capacitor-Based Chopper Circuit for DC Capacitor Voltage Balancing in Diode-Clamped Multilevel Inverter","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5210147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11341395","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flying-Capacitor-Based Chopper Circuit for DC Capacitor Voltage Balancing in Diode-Clamped Multilevel Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-shukla-2029527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184947S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5483249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5483249","articleId":"5210147","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5210149,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay E.

The FL-based controller cannot be implemented unless the full transformed state vector is available. The design also requires exact knowledge of the system model making the controller performance sensitive to uncertainties. To address these issues, an ESO is designed, which estimates the state vector, as well as the uncertainties in an integrated manner. The FL controller uses the states estimated by ESO, and the effect of uncertainties is compensated by augmenting the FL controller with the ESO-estimated uncertainties. The closed-loop stability of the system under the proposed observer-controller structure is established. The effectiveness of the ESO in the estimation of the states and uncertainties and the effectiveness of the FL + ESO controller in tracking are demonstrated through simulations. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through experimentation on Quanser's flexible-joint module.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2029528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05210149.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Extended-State-Observer-Based Control of Flexible-Joint System With Experimental Validation","volume":"57","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210149/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168824","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210149/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended-State-Observer-Based Control of Flexible-Joint System With Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"tie-talole-2029528.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072809S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"327","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5210149","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5210151,"authors":[{"name":"Shinn-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5338640/5210151/5210151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shinn-Horng Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1987 and 1989, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and mechatronic engineering from the National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, in 1996.","He is currently a Professor of mechanical engineering with the National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung City, where he was a Professor and the Chairman with the Mechanical Engineering Department from October 2006 to July 2009.

The FRBFN is prestructured, and its parameters are configured such that they are associated with their physical meaning. The parameters of the output layer are learned online via gradient algorithm. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that it does not require the training data and the vehicle longitudinal dynamic model. Simulation results on a vehicle theoretical model are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller. In order to investigate the proposed control algorithms in real-life situations, a small-scaled vehicle with computer and sensors onboard is developed.

To realize a field-oriented control of AC machines that is able to work at zero speed, the most commonly used methods are either sensor-based models or transient-signal-excitation methods. The major disadvantage of present signal-injection methods is that they are intrusive to pulsewidth modulation (PWM). An additional switching sequence has to be embedded in the control that will cause a torque and current ripple. In order to overcome these problems, a new flux-estimation algorithm that uses the phase current derivative to extract the flux-position information is presented. In contrast to previously introduced methods, this new approach operates without additional transient excitation of the machine and requires only fundamental-wave excitation using standard PWM or slightly modified PWM. Furthermore, only the current response in the two active states of PWM is used. This makes it possible to use sensorless control for the whole speed range including overmodulation and removes the distortion and parasitic influence of the zero switching states during the estimation of the flux. Experimental results are presented to validate the applicability of the presented approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05210155.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2029578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using PWM-Induced Transient Excitation and Advanced Signal Processing for Zero-Speed Sensorless Control of AC Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Signal processing","Sensorless control","AC machines","Induction machines","Space vector pulse width modulation","Torque control","Signal processing algorithms","Data mining","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","asynchronous machines","machine vector control","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM-induced transient excitation","advanced signal processing","zero-speed sensorless control","AC machines","induction machines","field-oriented control","sensor-based models","transient-signal-excitation methods","signal-injection methods","pulsewidth modulation","switching sequence","flux-estimation algorithm","flux-position information extraction","phase current derivative","fundamental-wave excitation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","current measurement","induction motor","neuronal networks","pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","saturation","speed control","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using PWM-Induced Transient Excitation and Advanced Signal Processing for Zero-Speed Sensorless Control of AC Machines","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5210155/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019849","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using PWM-Induced Transient Excitation and Advanced Signal Processing for Zero-Speed Sensorless Control of AC Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-wolbank-2029578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098733S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5210155","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5210156,"authors":[{"name":"Eung-Ho Kim","affiliation":["HAC Control Research and Development Laboratory, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/5210156/5210156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eung-Ho Kim was born in Jeju, Korea, in 1977.

However, collision avoidance and driver-assistance applications based on camera/radar sensors require data rates up to hundreds of megabits per second as well as fault tolerance, features that can hardly be covered by current or expected automotive standards.

This framework exploits the following: 1) the function block, a well-known paradigm in the industrial automation domain, to provide the control engineer with the ability to construct its systems as aggregations of existing components and 2) the real-time Linux to execute the automatically synthesized executable. A prototype runtime environment is described, and a laboratory example application using a robotic arm is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework.

In traditional control systems, centralized control (CC) and distributed control (DC) are two major approaches. However, little work has been done in comparing the two approaches in joint problems of control and communication, particularly in WSANs serving as components of control loops. In this paper, we develop a CC scheme in which control decisions are made based on global information and a DC scheme which enables distributed actuators to make control decisions locally. We also develop methods that enable wireless communications among system devices compatible with the control strategies, and propose a method for reducing packet-loss rate. We compare the two schemes using simulations in many aspects. Simulation results show that the DC can achieve a comparable control performance of the CC, while the DC is more robust against packet loss and has lower computational complexity than the CC. Furthermore, the DC has shorter actuation latency than the CC under certain conditions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","startPage":"3596","endPage":"3605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05210161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building-Environment Control With Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks: Centralized Versus Distributed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5210161/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Building-Environment Control With Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks: Centralized Versus Distributed","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579590","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building-Environment Control With Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks: Centralized Versus Distributed","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2029585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073987S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5210161","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5210163,"authors":[{"name":"Reine J.

Proceeding from a fourth-order model representing the air subsystem of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, a reduced third-order model is presented. Simulations show that the relative error caused by this reduction does not exceed 5%. Experimental validation has been done on a 33-kW PEM fuel cell, for both fourth- and reduced third-order models with less than 5% relative error. Additionally, a higher order sliding-mode supertwisting algorithm, with a well-known heuristic modification using variable gains, has been designed and validated experimentally to control a permanent-magnet synchronous motor that drives a volumetric compressor (double screw) designed to feed the 33-kW fuel cell with air.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Validation of a PEM Fuel-Cell Reduced-Order Model and a Moto-Compressor Higher Order Sliding-Mode Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2029588","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05210163.pdf","startPage":"1906","endPage":"1913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Validation of a PEM Fuel-Cell Reduced-Order Model and a Moto-Compressor Higher Order Sliding-Mode Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5210163/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286115","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Validation of a PEM Fuel-Cell Reduced-Order Model and a Moto-Compressor Higher Order Sliding-Mode Control","sourcePdf":"tie-talj-2029588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066986S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5210163","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210164,"authors":[{"name":"Jere Kolehmainen","affiliation":["ABB Oy Motors, Vaasa, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5210164/5210164-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jere Kolehmainen received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in theoretical physics from the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","He is currently with ABB Oy, Motors, Vaasa, Finland.

A simple model is created for making comparison with the different pole numbers easier. Main dimensions of the machine are kept the same. Optimal solutions for various pole numbers are searched and discussed. It is shown that for lower pole numbers, the structure is electrically better, while for higher pole numbers, the structure is mechanically stronger against centrifugal forces.

The proposed device is derived from the L-band complex MILO put forward by Fan According to the operation principle, the dual-frequency MILO is divided into two MILOs (MILO-1 and MILO-2). The MILO-2 (X-band MILO) is studied first, where a new load is introduced to keep it from disruption by anode plasma in the load region. Then, the dual-frequency MILO model is overall analyzed and optimized. Results of particle-in-cell simulation show that when the dual-frequency MILO is driven by an electron beam with 610 kV and 82 kA, two HPMs are generated with a total power of 5.9 GW, and power conversion efficiency is about 11.8%. HPM of MILO-1 falls in C-band of 7.6 GHz with a power of 3.2 GW, and that of MILO-2 lies in X-band of 9.26 GHz with a power of 2.7 GW. Power difference between the two HPMs is about 0.7 dB. Time-frequency analysis shows that no frequency interference between MILO-1 and MILO-2 occurs. The results in this paper verify the feasibility of a high-efficiency dual-high-frequency MILO. Correlative experiments are being prepared in our laboratory.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2009.2027603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5280460/05210170.pdf","startPage":"2041","endPage":"2047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2009.2027603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Dual-Frequency Magnetically Insulated Transmission Line Oscillator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210170/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Dual-Frequency Magnetically Insulated Transmission Line Oscillator","volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917930","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210170/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Dual-Frequency Magnetically Insulated Transmission Line Oscillator","sourcePdf":"tps-ju-2027603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073923S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5280460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5280460","articleId":"5210170","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210174,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Ma","affiliation":["Victoria Research Laboratory, National ICT Australia, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Yiran Ma received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunication engineering in 2005 from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, the Master of Telecommunications Engineering degree from the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In 2005, he was an Intern for half a year at the China Academy of Space Technology, where he developed algorithms of real-time encryption and decryption for communication networks.

We also investigate how each of these modulation formats performs under two distinct 2-D coding schemes, i.e., single-pulse per row (SPR) and multiple-pulse per row (MPR). For both cases, we have accounted for the simultaneous effect of many different dispersion and noise mechanisms (including multiple access interference (MAI) that impair the overall system performance. We have included the laser relative intensity noise at the transmitter side, the fiber dispersive effects (group velocity dispersion (GVD), and first-order polarization-mode dispersion (PMD), and beat, avalanche photodiode (APD), and thermal noises at the receiver side. The effect of GVD and PMD, as well as the influence of noises, on the performance of SPR and MPR codes is also investigated. Another effect studied in this paper is the influence of the APD photodetector on the beat noise of an incoherent OCDMA network. To mitigate systems noises and bit error rate (BER), we have adopted a forward error correction (FEC) RS(255, 239) algorithm in both networks investigated here. New expressions for the BER with all noises and dispersion mechanisms were also derived for the SPR and MPR code schemes. Results indicated that OOK and PPM modulation schemes without additional mechanisms to mitigate MAI and other noise effects are not sufficient to accommodate 32 simultaneous users in an error-free environment (BER < 10-12). This occurs due to the already high BER at the FEC input, which severely affects FECs at the receiver side.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2030775","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5235152/05210184.pdf","startPage":"5134","endPage":"5144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2030775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of High-Speed Optical Wavelength/Time CDMA Networks Using Pulse-Position Modulation and Forward Error Correction Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210184/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of High-Speed Optical Wavelength/Time CDMA Networks Using Pulse-Position Modulation and Forward Error Correction Techniques","volume":"27","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10927043","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5210184/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of High-Speed Optical Wavelength/Time CDMA Networks Using Pulse-Position Modulation and Forward Error Correction Techniques","sourcePdf":"jlt-borges-2030775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080677S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5235152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5235152","articleId":"5210184","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210189,"authors":[{"name":"Jingya Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5338051/5210189/5210189-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingya Dai (S\u201906) received the B.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

Selective harmonic elimination (SHE) has been the dominant modulation scheme because of its capability to eliminate unwanted low-order harmonics at low switching frequencies. Conventional space vector modulation (SVM), as another CSC modulation scheme, provides variable modulation index control but its output contains low-order harmonics with high magnitudes. In this paper, a multisampling SVM (MS-SVM) is proposed to substantially suppress the low-order harmonics in practical CSC-based drives. Investigation of the switching frequency of the proposed modulation method is carried out and methods to reduce additional switchings are developed. The proposed MS-SVM method exhibits a superior low-order harmonic performance comparable to that of SHE and provides the same fast and flexible control capability as the conventional SVM. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the proposed methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multisampling SVM Scheme for Current Source Converters With Superior Harmonic Performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2030808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5338051/05210189.pdf","startPage":"2436","endPage":"2445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2030808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Multisampling SVM Scheme for Current Source Converters With Superior Harmonic Performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5210189/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11003595","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multisampling SVM Scheme for Current Source Converters With Superior Harmonic Performance","sourcePdf":"tpel-dai-2030808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11568S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5338051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5338051","articleId":"5210189","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210191,"authors":[{"name":"Xihua Zou","affiliation":["The Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada","The School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5282655/5210191/5210191-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xihua Zou received his B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","He has been a joint training Ph.D. student in the School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China and the School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.

The simultaneous optical phase modulation and intensity modulation are implemented using a polarization modulator (PolM) in conjunction with an optical polarizer. The phase- and intensity-modulated optical signals are then sent to a dispersive element, to introduce chromatic dispersions, which results in two complementary dispersion-induced power penalty functions. The ratio between the two power penalty functions has a unique relationship with the microwave frequency. Therefore, by measuring the microwave powers and calculating the power ratio, the microwave frequency can be estimated. Thanks to the complementary nature of the power penalty functions, a power ratio having a faster change rate versus the input frequency, i.e., a greater first-order derivative, is resulted, which ensures an improved measurement range and resolution. The proposed approach for microwave frequency measurement of a continuous-wave and a pulsed microwave signal is experimentally investigated. A frequency measurement range as large as 17 GHz with a measurement resolution of plusmn 0.2 GHz for a continuous-wave microwave signal and plusmn0.5 GHz for a pulsed microwave signal is achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2030695","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5282655/05210191.pdf","startPage":"5314","endPage":"5320","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2030695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous Microwave Frequency Measurement With Improved Measurement Range and Resolution Based on Simultaneous Phase Modulation and Intensity Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2009","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Microwave Frequency Measurement With Improved Measurement Range and Resolution Based on Simultaneous Phase Modulation and Intensity Modulation","volume":"27","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/5210191/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10916423","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Microwave Frequency Measurement With Improved Measurement Range and Resolution Based on Simultaneous Phase Modulation and Intensity Modulation","sourcePdf":"jlt-jyao-2030695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109267S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5282655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5282655","articleId":"5210191","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5210195,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5353758/5210195/5210195-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang (S\u201905) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

The detector, however, involves a highly nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which was solved via a two-dimensional iterative search method initialized by a suboptimal estimator. In this paper, we present a simplified GLRT along with a new estimator for the problem. Both the estimator and the GLRT are derived in closed form at considerably lower complexity. With adequate training data, the new GLRT achieves a similar detection performance as the original one. However, for the more interesting case of limited training, the original GLRT may become inferior due to poor initialization. Because of its simpler form, the new GLRT also offers additional insight into the parametric multichannel signal detection problem. The performance of the proposed detector is assessed using both a simulated dataset, which was generated using multichannel AR models, and the KASSPER dataset, a widely used dataset with challenging heterogeneous effects found in real-world environments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2030835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05210195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2030835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","startPage":"317","endPage":"325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Parametric GLRT for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Parametric GLRT for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020537","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5210195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Parametric GLRT for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2030835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071443S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5210195","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210196,"authors":[{"name":"Dalin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Dalin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37399202400"},{"name":"Balasubramaniam Natarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Balasubramaniam","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37278060200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5210196","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","MIMO","Feedback","Covariance matrix","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Error probability","Throughput","Samarium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","feedback","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis exploration algorithm","limited feedback-based unitary precoder design","single user-MIMO capacity maximisation","polyphase unitary precoding matrix","error probability minimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Limited feedback","MIMO","trellis exploration algorithm","unitary precoding"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we present a novel approach to determine limited feedback-based unitary precoder for maximizing single user (SU)-MIMO capacity.

In this scheme, the user with the maximum effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is adaptively selected, and the closed-form symbol error rate (SER) of the joint diversity scheme is presented. The exact SER of the joint diversity scheme can then be derived for \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary QAM and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary PSK modulations in flat Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, using asymptotic analysis, we approximate the SER and clearly quantify both the diversity order and SNR gain for the joint diversity scheme. Based on this analysis, we show that the diversity order of the joint diversity scheme is improved in proportion to multiuser diversity (MUD) and spatial diversity, whereas the SNR gain worsens as spatial diversity increases. Finally, analytical results are verified through Monte-Carlo simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5226765/05210198.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2030851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2030851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5210198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Probability Analysis of Combining Space-Time Block Coding and Scheduling in MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Error analysis","Block codes","MIMO","Diversity reception","Signal to noise ratio","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Phase shift keying","Fading","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser detection","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","scheduling","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability analysis","space-time block coding","MIMO system","STBC","joint diversity scheme","opportunistic scheduling","multiple-input multiple-output system","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR gain","closed-form symbol error rate approximation","SER","M-ary QAM","M-ary PSK modulation","flat Rayleigh fading channel","asymptotic analysis","multiuser diversity detection","MUD","spatial diversity","Monte-Carlo simulation","adaptive selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser diversity (MUD)","space-time block coding (STBC)","symbol error rate (SER)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Error Probability Analysis of Combining Space-Time Block Coding and Scheduling in MIMO Systems","volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5210198/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10902811","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Probability Analysis of Combining Space-Time Block Coding and Scheduling in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"17lsp01-dlee-2030851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047252S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5226765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5226765","articleId":"5210198","onlineDate":"21 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5210200,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37273105900"},{"name":"Defeng Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Defeng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275607500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5210200","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Message passing","Intersymbol interference","Iterative decoding","Frequency estimation","Equalizers","Iterative methods","Coherence","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","Gaussian channels","graph theory","iterative methods","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GMP","Gaussian message passing technique","doubly selective channels","single-carrier transmission","iterative frequency domain equalization","graph-based channel estimation","FFG","Forney-style factor graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly selective channels","frequency domain equalization (FDE)","Gaussian message passing (GMP)"]}],"abstract":"We present a graph-based channel estimation approach for SC-IFDE (single-carrier transmissions with iterative frequency domain equalization) without CP (cyclic prefix) over doubly selective channels using the recently developed Gaussian message passing (GMP) technique.

In addition, by adopting different front-end circuitries, a number of diode-assisted inverter variants can be designed with each having its own operational principle and voltage gain expression. For controlling them, a generic modulation scheme that can be used for controlling all diode-assisted variants with minimized harmonic distortion and component stress is first designed, before proceeding on to design a second scheme with minimized commutation count for complement.

This approach, that allows the interface between the optical physical layer and the current terrestrial technology for wireless sensor networks, is a first step that will be followed by works on upper layers. In this paper, the main research challenges and current results are illustrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5210866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5210866/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10839506","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Building an Underwater Wireless Sensor Network Based on Optical: Communication: Research Challenges and Current Results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building an Underwater Wireless Sensor Network Based on Optical: Communication: Research Challenges and Current Results","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3669a476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04262S","chronDate":"18-23 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210827","isNumber":"5210828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210827","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5210828","articleId":"5210866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5210869,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Nedelcu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Department of Telecommunications, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Nedelcu","id":"37892165000"},{"name":"Radu Lupoaie","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Department of Telecommunications, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Lupoaie","id":"37891864100"},{"name":"Andrei A.

Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention. This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques. This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes: signature-based, anomaly-based, DNS-based, and mining-base.

One fundamental challenge is to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the primary link while maximizing the transmission rate of the secondary links. In this paper, we investigate cooperation based spectrum access at the secondary networks. If the QoS requirement of primary link is stringent, low power is allowed at the cognitive radio user and the transmission rate is limited. It is beneficial that the cognitive radio user obtains cooperation from the surrounding users to increase the rate. The best relay which provides the maximal transmission rate is selected for cooperation. The transmission rate performance is investigated under the peak and average interference constraints (IC). The simulation results show that the transmission rate of cognitive radio link can be improved by cooperation, especially when the power of the direct link is limited. The achieved transmission rate under the average IC is higher than that under the peak IC, due to power adaptation between the transmitter and relay. And higher gain can be obtained as the number of potential relays increases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2009.267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210824","startPage":"359","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210823/5210824/05211095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Enhancement with Cooperation Based Transmission in the Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211095/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Enhancement with Cooperation Based Transmission in the Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10839256","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Enhancement with Cooperation Based Transmission in the Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"3679a359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042379S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210823","isNumber":"5210824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210823","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5210824","articleId":"5211095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5211096,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Hua","affiliation":["National mobile communication research lab, South-East University, China","College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Hua","id":"37266791700"},{"name":"Bei Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Li","id":"37899256800"},{"name":"Limin Meng","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Meng","id":"37417022700"},{"name":"Zhijiang Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhijiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37553988600"},{"name":"Banteng Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Banteng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404915600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3679-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211096","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"abstract":"TD-SCDMA has begin its commercial process in many cities of China, and equipment manufacturers are in dire need of the cheaper and simpler test solutions.

Active distribution networks-intelligent distribution networks that incorporate one or more of distributed generation, demand response, and energy storage into the operation of the distribution network-is a new concept that depends largely on the compatibility of these two initiatives. This paper considers the emergence of innovative protection practices, the motivation for their implementation, and analyzes whether distributed generation can be seamlessly integrated into these new constructs.

There are some studies in Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to analyze the functional connectivity between cortical areas with the oscillations feature of neuronal activity. However, it is also important to observe the functional connectivity through temporal correlation between cortical areas. We proposed a beamformer-based approach which exploits a maximum correlation criterion to maximize the significance level of correlation between brain activities. This criterion leads to a closed-form solution of the dipole orientation. Experiments with simulation data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, necessity, and accuracy of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10839684","htmlLink":"/document/5211230/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beamformer-Based Spatiotemporal Imaging of Correlated Brain Activities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamformer-Based Spatiotemporal Imaging of Correlated Brain Activities","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3656a431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084685S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211103","isNumber":"5211104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211103","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5211104","articleId":"5211230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5211244,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Eun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Eun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405523600"},{"name":"Soo-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo-Hyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404978800"},{"name":"Wan-Hyun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan-Hyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37588501900"},{"name":"Soon-Young Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Mokpo National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soon-Young","lastName":"Park","id":"37600425000"},{"name":"Jun-Sik Lim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Sik","lastName":"Lim","id":"37653566400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3656-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211244","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Ant colony optimization","Brain","Image processing","Alzheimer's disease","Noise reduction","Bioinformatics","Biomedical engineering","Computer science","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","image segmentation","medical image processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain MR images","image segmentation","ant colony optimization algorithm","meta-heuristic algorithm","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["segmentation","ant colony optimization","MR brain image","meta-heuristic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211244","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2009.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211104","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and BioEngineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211103/5211104/05211244.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of Brain MR Images Using an Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a segmentation method for brain MR images using an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm.

In this paper, we introduced segment, segment summary and segment mapping, and they can reduce the possibility of related node update problem and improve the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2009.54","publicationTitle":"2009 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210823/5210824/05211294.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2009.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Approach on B Tree Management for NAND Flash-Memory Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211294/","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Approach on B Tree Management for NAND Flash-Memory Storage Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5211294/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10839311","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Approach on B Tree Management for NAND Flash-Memory Storage Systems","confLoc":"Taiyuan, China","sourcePdf":"3679a443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094977S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210823","isNumber":"5210824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210823","xplore-issue":"5210824","articleId":"5211294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5211323,"authors":[{"name":"Min Su Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min Su","lastName":"Lee","id":"37676142400"},{"name":"Je-Keun Rhee","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Je-Keun","lastName":"Rhee","id":"37086422417"},{"name":"Byoung-Hee Kim","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Hee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37895900500"},{"name":"Byoung-Tak Zhang","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Tak","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37336068500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3656-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211323","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"Various real-world biomedical classification tasks suffer from the imbalanced data problem which tends to make the prediction performance of some classes significantly decrease. In this paper, we present an active example selection method with naiumlve Bayes classifier (AESNB) as a solution for the imbalanced data problem. The proposed method starts with a small balanced subset of training examples. A naive Bayes classifier is trained incrementally by actively selecting and adding informative examples regardless of the original class distribution. Informative examples are defined as examples that produce high error scores by the current classifier. We examined the performance of AESNB algorithm by using five imbalanced biomedical datasets. Our experimental results show that the naiumlve Bayes classifier with our active example selection method achieves a competitive classification performance compared to the classifier with sampling or cost-sensitive methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Sampling methods","Biomedical engineering","Data mining","Computer science","Data engineering","Costs","Data privacy","Diseases","Proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AESNB algorithm","naive Bayes classifier","active example selection","imbalanced biomedical data","biomedical classification","data mining","imbalanced learning problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active example selection","imbalanced data problem","na\u00efve Bayes classifier","resampling","cost-senseitive learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2009.63","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and BioEngineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211103/5211104/05211323.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2009.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AESNB: Active Example Selection with Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier for Learning from Imbalanced Biomedical Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AESNB: Active Example Selection with Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier for Learning from Imbalanced Biomedical Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211323/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5211323/","accessionNumber":"10839744","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AESNB: Active Example Selection with Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier for Learning from Imbalanced Biomedical Data","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3656a015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062172S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211103","isNumber":"5211104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211103","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5211104","articleId":"5211323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5211373,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Bing Han","affiliation":["Hebei Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Bing","lastName":"Han","id":"37085970610"},{"name":"He Yun He","affiliation":["54th Res.

While the transportation community emphasizes developing standards for storing this incident data, little effort has been made to design appropriate visual analytics tools to explore the data, extract meaningful knowledge, and represent results. Analyzing these large multivariate geospatial datasets is a non-trivial task. A novel, web-based, visual analytics tool called ICE (incident cluster explorer) is proposed as an application that affords sophisticated yet user-friendly analysis of transportation incident datasets. Interactive maps, histograms, two-dimensional plots and parallel coordinates plots are four visualizations that are integrated together to allow users to simultaneously interact with and see relationships between multiple visualizations. Accompanied by a rich set of filters, users can create custom conditions to filter data and focus on a smaller dataset. Due to the multivariate nature of the data, a rank-by-feature framework has been expanded to quantify the strength of relationships between the different fields.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2009.5211551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211536","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5207499/5211536/05211551.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICE--visual analytics for transportation incident datasets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211551/","displayDocTitle":"ICE--visual analytics for transportation incident datasets","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10838461","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICE--visual analytics for transportation incident datasets","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"037_057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068791S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5207499","isNumber":"5211536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5207499","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5211536","articleId":"5211551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5211552,"authors":[{"name":"Michael VanDaniker","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"VanDaniker","id":"37888604200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4114-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4116-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211552","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Detectors","Decision making","Disaster management","Educational institutions","Road transportation","Layout","Vehicle detection","Vehicles","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","decision making","geographic information systems","interactive systems","real-time systems","rendering (computer graphics)","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time traffic incident data visualization","archived traffic incident data visualization","delayed decision-making","transportation incident management explorer","TIME","temporal data rendering","geospatial data","interactive map"]}],"abstract":"The volume of data associated with a single transportation incident is difficult to comprehend, and existing systems often fail to equip users with the tools to rapidly make sense of this data. The consequences of delayed decision-making or misinterpreting data can be life threatening. A tool that gives the incident manager the ability to grasp the entire picture of an incident in a minimal amount of time is essential to facilitate quick decision-making. The transportation incident management explorer (TIME) visualizes real-time and historic traffic incident data. Temporal data are rendered as timelines and geospatial data are plotted on an interactive map, providing users freedom to explore regions affected by an incident.

When examples of one class greatly outnumber examples of the other class (es), traditional machine learning algorithms can perform poorly. Random undersampling is a technique that has shown great potential for alleviating the problem of class imbalance. However, undersampling leads to information loss which can hinder classification performance in some cases. To overcome this problem, repetitive undersampling techniques have been proposed. These techniques generate an ensemble of models, each trained on a different, undersampled subset of the training data. In doing so, less information is lost and classification performance is improved. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several repetitive undersampling techniques. To our knowledge, no study has so thoroughly compared repetitive undersampling techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2009.5211614","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/5207499/5211536/05211614.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"34","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2009.5211614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical comparison of repetitive undersampling techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An empirical comparison of repetitive undersampling techniques","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10838437","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical comparison of repetitive undersampling techniques","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"006_154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068043S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5207499","isNumber":"5211536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5207499","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5211536","articleId":"5211614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":5211639,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper a modified random search technique is employed so that fastest convergence is obtained for the same results published in IEEE Proceedings so far. To show its efficiency and effectiveness, the proposed EPSO is applied to test ED problems, one with smooth cost functions and others with nonsmooth cost functions considering valve-point loading effects. The experimental results show that the proposed EPSO method was indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in ED problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10838074","htmlLink":"/document/5211639/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient Particle Swarm Optimization for Economic Dispatch with valve-point effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient Particle Swarm Optimization for Economic Dispatch with valve-point effect","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"FP1398_FE-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056022S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5197445","isNumber":"5211621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197445","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5211621","articleId":"5211639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5211647,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hsu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Hsu Wang","id":"37087163058"},{"name":"Pin-Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pin-Cheng Chen","id":"37087723566"},{"name":"Ping-Zong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ping-Zong Lin","id":"37087402595"},{"name":"Tsu-Tian Lee","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsu-Tian Lee","id":"37087160987"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4114-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4116-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211647","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211647","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Hopfield neural networks","Convergence","Electronic mail","System identification","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Force feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","Hopfield neural nets","identification","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic neural network model","nonlinear system identification","Hopfield neural network","convergent analysis","Lyapunov-like criterion","adaptive training law"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["system identification","dynamic neural network","Hopfield neural network","Lyapunov criterion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRI.2009.5211647","pdfPath":"/iel5/5207499/5211536/05211647.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","startPage":"440","endPage":"441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2009.5211647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic neural network model for nonlinear system identification","abstract":"In this paper, a new dynamic neural network based on the Hopfield neural network is proposed to perform the nonlinear system identification.

When exposed to voltage waveforms containing high amount of harmonics, the heat generation will be larger due to increased power losses as compared with power frequency excitation. This may result in a decreased life or even failure of insulation due to the increased operating temperature or to thermal runaway. An analysis of the power developed due to dielectric heating in two different materials subjected to voltage waveforms with high harmonic content is presented in this paper. By expressing the non-sinusoidal loss as an enhancement factor to the sinusoidal one, a geometry-independent formalism is derived. From dielectric response measurements at low voltage and at several temperatures the dielectric power loss in the material can be calculated for different voltage levels and waveforms. Two important material parameters can be extracted from the calculated dielectric power loss: (i) non-sinusoidal loss compared with sinusoidal loss with the same fundamental frequency (p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fact</sub>\n) and (ii) change of loss with changing temperature (dp\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fact</sub>\n/dT).

Additionally, the switching topology enables the discharge of the parasitic capacitances after each pulse, allowing the use of capacitive loads, and the clamping of inductive loads, recovering the reset energy back to the main capacitors.

Over the time of deployment, sensors are exposed to harsh conditions, causing some of them to fail or to deliver less accurate data. If such a degradation remains undetected, the usefulness of a sensor network can be greatly reduced. We present an approach that learns spatio-temporal correlations between different sensors, and makes use of the learned model to detect misbehaving sensors by using distributed computation and only local communication between nodes. We introduce SODESN, a distributed recurrent neural network architecture, and a learning method to train SODESN for fault detection in a distributed scenario. Our approach is evaluated using data from different types of sensors and is able to work well even with less-than-perfect link qualities and more than 50% of failed nodes.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5200255/5211879/05211909.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"374","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Poster abstract: Distributed fault detection using a recurrent neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Poster abstract: Distributed fault detection using a recurrent neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10838284","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211909/","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Poster abstract: Distributed fault detection using a recurrent neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041779S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5200255","isNumber":"5211879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5200255","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5211879","articleId":"5211909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5211922,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Pajic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Pajic","id":"37294788600"},{"name":"Rahul Mangharam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Mangharam","id":"37296357400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5108-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-371-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211922","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Jamming","Protocols","Resilience","Broadcasting","Context","Wireless sensor networks","Sleep","Batteries","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","jamming","protocols","random processes","statistical analysis","synchronisation","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded wireless network","anti jamming protocol","electromagnetic jamming","malicious jamming","communication protocol","energy-constrained wireless sensor network","node scheduling","battery life maximization","spatio-temporal pattern","contention-free communication","WisperNet time-synchronized protocol","coordinated temporal randomization","link layer slot schedule","link layer slot duration","statistical jammer","random jammer","censorship-to-link utilization ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-jamming","MAC protocol","wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Resilience to electromagnetic jamming and its avoidance are difficult problems. It is often both hard to distinguish malicious jamming from congestion in the broadcast regime and a challenge to conceal the activity patterns of the legitimate communication protocol from the jammer. In the context of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, nodes are scheduled to maximize the common sleep duration and coordinate communication to extend their battery life. This results in well-defined communication patterns with possibly predictable intervals of activity that are easily detected and jammed by a statistical jammer. We present an anti-jamming protocol for sensor networks which eliminates spatio-temporal patterns of communication while maintaining coordinated and contention-free communication across the network. Our protocol, WisperNet, is time-synchronized and uses coordinated temporal randomization for slot schedules and slot durations at the link layer and adapts routes to avoid jammers in the network layer. Through analysis, simulation and experimentation we demonstrate that WisperNet reduces the efficiency of any statistical jammer to that of a random jammer, which has the lowest censorship-to-link utilization ratio. WisperNet has been implemented on the FireFly sensor network platform.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211879","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5200255/5211879/05211922.pdf","endPage":"312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-jamming for embedded wireless networks","startPage":"301","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Anti-jamming for embedded wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211922/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10838297","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211922/","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-jamming for embedded wireless networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057018S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5200255","isNumber":"5211879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5200255","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5211879","articleId":"5211922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5211924,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Ceriotti","affiliation":["IRST, Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy","Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dell'Informazione, University of Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Ceriotti","id":"37831124900"},{"name":"Luca Mottola","affiliation":["IRST, Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy","Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dell'Informazione, University of Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Mottola","id":"37299595700"},{"name":"Gian Pietro Picco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dell'Informazione, University of Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian Pietro","lastName":"Picco","id":"37299595000"},{"name":"Amy L.

Existing distributed optimization algorithms typically rely on choosing a step size to ensure convergence. In this case, the communication between sensor nodes occurs each time the computations are carried out. Since in sensor networks, the energy required for communication can be significantly greater than the energy required to perform computation, it would be beneficial if we can somehow separate communication and computation. This paper presents such a distributed algorithm called the event-triggered algorithm. Under event triggering, each agent broadcasts to its neighbors when a local ldquoerrorrdquo signal exceeds a state dependent threshold. We give a general class of problems in sensor networks where the event-triggered algorithm can be used. In particular, this paper uses the data gathering problem as an example. We propose an event-triggered distributed algorithm and prove its convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of message exchanges by two orders of magnitude compared to commonly used dual decomposition algorithms. It also enjoys better scalability with respect to the depth of the tree and the maximum branch number of the tree.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-triggered distributed optimization in sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5200255/5211879/05211941.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Event-triggered distributed optimization in sensor networks","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10838316","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-triggered distributed optimization in sensor networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032851S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","isNumber":"5211879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5200255","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5211941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5211942,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Lukac","affiliation":[" Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Lukac","id":"37313222200"},{"name":"Paul Davis","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Davis","id":"37892767000"},{"name":"Robert Clayton","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, US"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Clayton","id":"37088563320"},{"name":"Deborah Estrin","affiliation":["University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Estrin","id":"37280885300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5108-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-371-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211942","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5211942","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Geoscience","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Earth","Background noise","Permission","Hardware","Computer networks","Embedded computing","Geology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","intelligent sensors","seismic waves","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal integrity","data driven time synchronization","embedded sensing system","GPS","microseisms","acoustic source localization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time Synchronization","Microseisms","Background Noise Correlation"]}],"abstract":"Data driven time synchronization (DDTS) provides synchronization across sensors by using underlying characteristics of data collected by an embedded sensing system. We apply the concept of data driven time synchronization through a seismic deployment consisting of 100 seismic sensors to repair data that was not time synchronized correctly. This deployment used GPS for time synchronization, but due to system faults common to environmental sensing systems, data was collected with large time offsets. In seismic deployments, offset data is often never used, but we show that data driven time synchronization can recover the synchronization and make the data usable. To implement data driven time synchronization to repair the time offsets we use microseisms as the underlying characteristics. Microseisms are waves that travel through the earth's crust and are independent of the seismic events used for the study of the earth's structure. We have developed a model of microseism propagation through a linear seismic array and use the model to obtain time correction shifts. By simulating time offsets in real data which does not have offsets, we determined that this method is able to repair the offset to between 0.05 and 0.2 seconds. Our ongoing work will attempt to refine the model to correct the offsets to less than 0.05 seconds and evaluate how errors in the correction affect seismic results such as event location. Data driven time synchronization may be applicable to other high data rate embedded sensing applications such as acoustic source localization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211879","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5200255/5211879/05211942.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovering temporal integrity with Data Driven Time Synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recovering temporal integrity with Data Driven Time Synchronization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10838317","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211942/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering temporal integrity with Data Driven Time Synchronization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059357S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5200255","isNumber":"5211879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5200255","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5211879","articleId":"5211942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5211943,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Danev","affiliation":["System Security Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Danev","id":"37888526200"},{"name":"Srdjan Capkun","affiliation":["System Security Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Srdjan","lastName":"Capkun","id":"37324275800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5108-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-60558-371-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5211943","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":744},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Communication system security","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Spread spectrum communication","Cryptography","Message authentication","Cryptographic protocols","Error analysis","Polarization","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","message authentication","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-wireless multihop sensor network security","wireless sensor node identification","transient-based identification","radio transmission","reliable identification","wormhole attack","Sybil attack","replication attack","cryptographic message authentication protocol","equal error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Security","Fingerprinting","Sensor Networks"]}],"abstract":"Identification of wireless sensor nodes based on the characteristics of their radio transmissions can provide an additional layer of security in all-wireless multi-hop sensor networks.

Existing time synchronization algorithms provide on average good synchronization between arbitrary nodes, however, as we show in this paper, close-by nodes in a network may be synchronized poorly. We propose the gradient time synchronization protocol (GTSP) which is designed to provide accurately synchronized clocks between neighbors. GTSP works in a completely decentralized fashion: Every node periodically broadcasts its time information. Synchronization messages received from direct neighbors are used to calibrate the logical clock. The algorithm requires neither a tree topology nor a reference node, which makes it robust against link and node failures. The protocol is implemented on the Mica2 platform using TinyOS. We present an evaluation of GTSP on a 20-node testbed setup and simulations on larger network topologies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211879","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5200255/5211879/05211944.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gradient clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5211944/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10838319","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5211944/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079674S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5200255","isNumber":"5211879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5200255","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5211879","articleId":"5211944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5211954,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An important step towards this direction has been made with the increasing development of storage technologies. The installation of stationary or on-board storage technologies, as well known, allows the recovery of the braking energy of the rolling stocks for increasing the energy efficiency of the whole system as well as improving the voltage profile. In the paper an optimization procedure is proposed for choosing in the planning stage the fundamental characteristics of a stationary storage device. The optimal parameters of the storage system can be determined by taking contemporaneously into account the energy saving aspects, substation current minimization and reduction of voltage drops along the feeder.

Fault locating in transmission networks is not very hard and complicated due to low impedance of faults. This job is usually done by distance relays. But, in distribution networks, because of high impedance of fault and its vast variety and also simplicity of protective devices, determining the exact location of faults is very complicated. On the other hand, penetration of distribution generation into distribution networks reinforces the necessity of designing new protection systems for these networks. One of the main capabilities that can improve the efficiency of new protection relays in distribution systems is exact fault locating. In this paper, a new approach for determining the exact fault type and location in distribution systems including distributed generation using MLP neural networks is presented. In the suggested method, after determining the fault type, by normalizing the fault current of the main source, the corresponding trained neural network has been activated and the exact location of occurred fault has been derived. The presented method has been implemented on a sample distribution network, simulated by DIgSILENT Power Factory 13.2, and its performance has been tested. The simulation results show high performance and accuracy of the method and substantiate that it can be used in modern heuristic protection schemes in distribution systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEP.2009.5212044","startPage":"284","endPage":"289","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power","pdfPath":"/iel5/5204039/5211951/05212044.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Clean Electrical Power","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEP.2009.5212044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5211951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining fault's type and accurate location in distribution systems with DG using MLP Neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Power system protection","Impedance","Protective relaying","Design methodology","Power system faults","Power system relaying","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","fault location","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","power distribution faults","power distribution protection","power engineering computing","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","DG networks","MLP neural network","power system fault","distribution network protection","distribution power generation","protection relays","neural network training","DIgSILENT Power Factory 13.2 simulation","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Generation","Distribution System","Fault Location","Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Determining fault's type and accurate location in distribution systems with DG using MLP Neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5212044/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10846451","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining fault's type and accurate location in distribution systems with DG using MLP Neural networks","confLoc":"Capri, Italy","sourcePdf":"SB112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065634S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5204039","isNumber":"5211951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5204039","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5211951","articleId":"5212044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5212061,"authors":[{"name":"E.

First, an orthogonal gold sequence set is generated via preferred-pair of m sequences, and then are used to spread spectrum of the two copyright watermarks. Before embedded into the DWT domain of the original audio in a fashion similar to DS-CDMA, the CDMA encoded watermark messages are mixed with a chaotic sequence for more security. This chaotic sequence is introduced as a secret embedding key so that the proposed scheme is robust to watermark counterfeiting. Blind recovery of each embedded watermark is achieved by using the fast fixed-point independent component analysis (FastICA) algorithm and the secret keys. Experiment results demonstrate that the watermarks with the proposed algorithm can be detected with low bit error rate (BER) and high security against common audio processing manipulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212199","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212112/05212199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212112","startPage":"2205","endPage":"2210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multiple audio watermarking algorithm applying DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new multiple audio watermarking algorithm applying DS-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212199/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10845643","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5212199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multiple audio watermarking algorithm applying DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"0903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044502S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5212112","articleId":"5212199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5212254,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Ping Liao","affiliation":["College of Computer & Information Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ping","lastName":"Liao","id":"37687087300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212254","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Minimization methods","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Job shop scheduling","Genetic mutations","Proposals","Educational institutions","Genetic engineering","Nearest neighbor searches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow shop scheduling","genetic algorithms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal genetic algorithm","total flowtime minimization","no-wait flow shop problem","nearest neighbor","orthogonal crossover operator","effective local search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["No-wait Flowshop","Genetic Algorithm","Total flowtime","Orthogonal Crossover"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212254","abstract":"In this paper, an orthogonal genetic algorithm is proposed for the no-wait flowshop problem with total flowtime minimization.

Game Theory provides mathematical models of real-world situations for studying intelligent behavior. Most of time, effective decision-making in strategic situations (such as competitive situations) requires nonlinear mapping between stimulus and response. This sort of mapping can be provided by Artificial Neural Networks. This paper describes the use of a human-like Artificial Neural Network to find the optimal strategy in strategic situations without injecting expert knowledge. In order to train such a Neural Network, an unsupervised reinforcement-learning rule using Back-Propagation is introduced. Unlike most of reinforcement learning systems, this learning rule can operate with continuous outputs, what makes it worth for a lot of different applications. Finally, this decision maker is used to find the optimal strategy in the well-known Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, in order to demonstrate that this human-like Artificial Neural Networks can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212314","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212225/05212314.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1285","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of neural networks as decision makers in strategic situations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Use of neural networks as decision makers in strategic situations","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10845719","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5212314/","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of neural networks as decision makers in strategic situations","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"0765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061747S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","xplore-issue":"5212225","articleId":"5212314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212326,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Xie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Research Institute of Diagnostics & Cybernetics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hang Xie","id":"37087453282"},{"name":"Hao Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Research Institute of Diagnostics & Cybernetics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hao Tang","id":"37087184720"},{"name":"Yu-He Liao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Research Institute of Diagnostics & Cybernetics, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yu-He Liao","id":"37087765228"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212326","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3897},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212326","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Cybernetics","Machine learning","Delay effects","Vibration measurement","Testing","Computer architecture","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","feedforward neural nets","neural net architecture","nonlinear dynamical systems","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series prediction","NARX neural networks","dynamical neural architecture","nonlinear dynamical systems","feedforward time delay neural network","vibration data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NARX networks","Embedding theory","Gamma Test","Time series prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212326","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212225/05212326.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time series prediction based on NARX neural networks: An advanced approach","abstract":"The NARX network is a dynamical neural architecture commonly used for input-output modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems.

In this paper, it is shown that the original architecture of the NARX network can be easily and efficiently applied to prediction of time series using embedding theory to reconstruct the input of NARX network.

The control scheme combines RBF neural network algorithm and sliding mode.

As for the chattering in the sliding mode control, a hyperbolic function is applied to replace the symbols to eliminate the chattering phenomenon effectively and decrease the control input when the precision error is permit. The stability of the control system was ensured by Lyapunov method. The tracking error asymptotic converges to zero. The simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212337","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1270","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212225","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212225/05212337.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The RBF neural network control for the uncertain robotic manipulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212337/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The RBF neural network control for the uncertain robotic manipulator","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5212337/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10845742","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The RBF neural network control for the uncertain robotic manipulator","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"0654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038961S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","xplore-issue":"5212225","articleId":"5212337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212350,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Rong Liang","affiliation":["College of Information, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China","College of Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xin-Rong Liang","id":"37087633322"},{"name":"Ye-Kun Fan","affiliation":["College of Information, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Ye-Kun Fan","id":"37087632591"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Tao Jiang","id":"37087166784"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212350","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Control systems","Pi control","Nonhomogeneous media","Automatic control","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Machine learning algorithms","Educational institutions","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","PI control","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO algorithm","coordinated ramp control","multilayer control structure","particle swarm optimization algorithm","macroscopic model","freeway traffic flow","control system","traffic model","traffic density","freeway section","traffic state","PI control","traffic jams","traffic flow stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Freeway","Multilayer control","Traffic flow model","PI control","PSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212350","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212225","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212225/05212350.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of PSO algorithm to coordinated ramp control","abstract":"A multilayer control structure and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm are used for coordinated ramp control on freeways.

Usually, one of them is melody track, and others accompaniment tracks. To recognize the melody track from multiple tracks is important for the music retrieval and other music related applications. Though lots of researchers had researched on this topic, more efficient and precise methods are still needed. An innovative method based on the improved neural network to distinguish melody from accompaniment is proposed to recognize the melody track from multiple tracks. A set of features from each track of the MIDI file are extracted. These features are input into an improved neural network classifier that assigns the probability of being a melodic line to each track. Then, the track with the highest probability is chosen as the melodic line of the MIDI file. Experiments show that when compared with other methods, the proposed approach is outperformed in recognition precision and is effective for solving the melody recognition problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212378","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212338/05212378.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1138","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIDI melody extraction based on improved neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIDI melody extraction based on improved neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10845819","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5212378/","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIDI melody extraction based on improved neural network","confLoc":"Hebei","sourcePdf":"1589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059009S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","xplore-issue":"5212338","articleId":"5212378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5212387,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Peng Wang","id":"37087220311"},{"name":"Li-Li Xie","affiliation":["Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin Vocational Institute, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Li-Li Xie","id":"37087731895"},{"name":"Yi-Cai Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yi-Cai Sun","id":"37087732077"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212387","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212387","abstract":"A new method for static electrical impedance tomography was proposed in this paper.

The experimental results are shown that the GA-LSSVR model outperforms the existing BP neural network approaches and the simple LSSVR based on the mean absolute percent error criterion.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212456","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1042","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212338","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212338/05212456.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition prediction of hydroturbine generating units using least squares support vector regression with genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212456/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Condition prediction of hydroturbine generating units using least squares support vector regression with genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5212456/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10845781","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition prediction of hydroturbine generating units using least squares support vector regression with genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"0330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062091S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5212338","articleId":"5212456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212485,"authors":[{"name":"Vegard Engen","affiliation":["Software Systems Research Centre, Bournemouth University, Poole, UK"],"firstName":"Vegard","lastName":"Engen","id":"37887768500"},{"name":"Jonathan Vincent","affiliation":["Software Systems Research Centre, Bournemouth University, Poole, UK"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Vincent","id":"37088265661"},{"name":"Amanda C.

In many applications, classes are not of equal importance, but the preferred trade-off may be hard to quantify a priori. In this paper, we adopt multi-objective techniques to create Pareto optimal sets of classifiers and ensembles, offering the user the choice of preferred trade-off. We also demonstrate that the common practice of developing a single ensemble from an arbitrary (diverse) selection of base classifiers will be inferior to a large proportion of those classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212485","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212451/05212485.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective evolution of the Pareto optimal set of neural network classifier ensembles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Machine learning","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","Pareto optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective evolution","Pareto optimal set","neural network classifier ensembles","classification error","multiobjective techniques","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimisation","genetic algorithms","classifier combination","ensembles","class imbalance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective evolution of the Pareto optimal set of neural network classifier ensembles","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5212485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10845338","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective evolution of the Pareto optimal set of neural network classifier ensembles","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"1265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084535S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5212451","articleId":"5212485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212522,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Fei Bai","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Chinese Information Processing of Ministry of Education, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Xue-Fei Bai","id":"37088243477"},{"name":"Wen-Jian Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Chinese Information Processing of Ministry of Education, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China"],"lastName":"Wen-Jian Wang","id":"37087808025"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212522","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212522","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method for facial expression recognition based on neural network ensemble.

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm. It is thus called cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (CCPSO). The proposed CCPSO method, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Cooperative behavior involves a collection of multiple swarms that interact by exchanging information to solve a problem. The belief space is the information repository in which the individuals can store their experiences such that other individuals can learn from them indirectly. The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This study uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural networks. The FLNFN model can generate the consequent part of a nonlinear combination of input variables. Finally, the proposed functional-link-based neural fuzzy network with cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (FLNFN-CCPSO) is adopted in predictive application. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed CCPSO method performs well in predicting the number of sunspots problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212629","startPage":"3076","endPage":"3082","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212095","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212095/05212629.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using an efficient hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm for neural fuzzy network design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212629/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using an efficient hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm for neural fuzzy network design","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5212629/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10845471","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an efficient hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm for neural fuzzy network design","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"1518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04516S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5212095","articleId":"5212629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212655,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Mei Li","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Dong-Mei Li","id":"37087537146"},{"name":"Fa-Chao Li","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Fa-Chao Li","id":"37087149463"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212655","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Neural networks","Radial basis function networks","Convergence","Machine learning","Cybernetics","System identification","Conference management","Technology management","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","identification","neurocontrollers","nonlinear systems","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic systems identification","noisy data","RBF neural networks","chaotic systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rbf neural networks","Chaotic systems identification","Noisy chaotic systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212655","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212095/05212655.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of chaotic systems with noisy data based on RBF neural networks","abstract":"In this paper, we present that noisy chaotic systems can be identified with RBF neural networks.

Simulations show that the identified models can approach to original chaotic systems and extract dynamical characteristics of original chaotic systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10845522","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5212655/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of chaotic systems with noisy data based on RBF neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of chaotic systems with noisy data based on RBF neural networks","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"1417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036136S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5212095","articleId":"5212655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5212716,"authors":[{"name":"Pawalai Kraipeerapun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pawalai","lastName":"Kraipeerapun","id":"37267334900"},{"name":"Sathit Nakkrasae","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sathit","lastName":"Nakkrasae","id":"37546558300"},{"name":"Somkid Amornsamankul","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in Mathematics, CHE, Bangkok, Thailand","Department of Mathematics, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Somkid","lastName":"Amornsamankul","id":"37546587800"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3702-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3703-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"5212716","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Machine learning","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regression problem","complementary neural network","truth value","falsity value","complementary output value","equal weight combination","dynamic weight combination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5212716","abstract":"In this paper, complementary neural networks (CMTNN) are used to solve the regression problem. CMTNN consist of a pair of opposite neural networks. The first neural network is trained to predict degree of truth values and the second neural network is trained to predict degree of falsity values. Both neural networks are complementary to each other since they deal with pairs of complementary output values. In order to predict the more accurate outputs, each pair of the truth and falsity values are aggregated based on two techniques which are equal weight combination and dynamic weight combination. The first technique is just a simple averaging whereas the second technique deals with errors occurred in the prediction. We experiment our approach to the classical benchmark problems including housing, concrete compressive strength, and computer hardware from the UCI machine learning repository. It is found that complementary neural networks improve the prediction performance as compared to the traditional single backpropagation neural network and support vector regression used to predict only truth values. Furthermore, the difference between the predicted truth value and the complement of the predicted falsity value can be used as an uncertainty indicator to support the confidence in the prediction of unknown input data.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212716","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197447/5212700/05212716.pdf","startPage":"3442","endPage":"3447","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary neural networks for regression problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5212716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Complementary neural networks for regression problems","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10845880","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5212716/","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary neural networks for regression problems","confLoc":"Baoding, China","sourcePdf":"1508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057926S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197447","isNumber":"5212700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197447","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5212700","articleId":"5212716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5212733,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278409600"},{"name":"Ming-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37597012900"},{"name":"Chiu-Hsiung Chen","affiliation":["Department of computer Science and Information Engineering, China University of Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiu-Hsiung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280749800"},{"name":"Daneil S.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in Rayleigh fading channels. Frame synchronization is an essential procedure for normal operation of the OFDM system because of sensitivity to synchronization errors. And when there are frequency offsets in OFDM frame, the loss of orthogonality occurs and the interference problem among several subcarriers is introduced. These fact leads to the requirement for joint implementation of the frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation. In order to enhance the frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation performances, we add a ternary sequence to OFDM signals in the time domain. The power level of the ternary sequence to be added needs to be low enough in order not to affect a normal operation of the OFDM system. The objective can be achieved successfully based on the correlation characteristics of the ternary sequence.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213113","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05213113.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ternary sequence based OFDM frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation scheme in wireless communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5213113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213113/","displayDocTitle":"Ternary sequence based OFDM frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation scheme in wireless communication channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846751","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5213113/","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ternary sequence based OFDM frame synchronization and frequency offset compensation scheme in wireless communication channels","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MPP13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055672S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5213113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5213114,"authors":[{"name":"X.Q.

Full rank projections are dealt with by i) computing the number of dominant singular values, on the basis of a threshold related to the Euclidean norm of an artificial error matrix and ii) finding the argument of minimizing the singular value criterion.

A humanoid robot should have the ability to autonomously recognize its surroundings and to make right decisions under unknown environment. To enable a humanoid robot to do this, ego-motion compensation for a humanoid robot is mandatory. Therefore, we suggest the ego-motion estimation method so that the errors of the environment recognition caused by the ego-motion of a humanoid robot are eliminated. This method uses the disparity map obtained from the stereo-vision and can be divided into three parts - segmentation, feature extraction, estimation. In the segmentation part, a novel type-2 fuzzy sets based segmentation method to extract the objects is used. In the feature extraction module, features are extracted by the wavelet level-set transform. Moreover, least square ellipse approximation is used in the estimation part to calculate the displacement for the rotation and translation between image sequences. From the results of experiments, we can know that the proposed method can be applied to a humanoid robot effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05213137.pdf","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1790","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5213137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo-vision based motion estimation of a humanoid robot for the ego-motion compensation by type-2 fuzzy sets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Humanoid robots","Fuzzy sets","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Mobile robots","Data mining","Machine vision","Image motion analysis","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","humanoid robots","image recognition","image segmentation","least squares approximations","mobile robots","motion compensation","motion estimation","stereo image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo-vision-based motion estimation","humanoid robot","ego-motion compensation","type-2 fuzzy set","autonomous surrounding recognition","environment recognition","disparity map","image segmentation","feature extraction","wavelet level-set transform","least square ellipse approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stereo-vision based motion estimation of a humanoid robot for the ego-motion compensation by type-2 fuzzy sets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5213137/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846759","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo-vision based motion estimation of a humanoid robot for the ego-motion compensation by type-2 fuzzy sets","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WA09-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047508S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5213137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5213139,"authors":[{"name":"Jurgen Van Erps","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics and Photonics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","ARC Centre for Ultrahigh Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems (CUDOS), Institute for Photonics and Optical Science (IPOS), School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Van Erps","id":"37298515600"},{"name":"Feng Luan","affiliation":["ARC Centre for Ultrahigh Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems (CUDOS), Institute for Photonics and Optical Science (IPOS), School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Feng Luan","id":"37087287960"},{"name":"Mark D.

Our new 3-D FFT kernel, written in NVIDIA CUDA, achieves nearly 80 GFLOPS on a top-end GPU, being more than three times faster than any existing FFT implementations on GPUs including CUFFT. Careful programming techniques are employed to fully exploit modern GPU hardware characteristics while overcoming their limitations, including on-chip shared memory utilization, optimizing the number of threads and registers through appropriate localization, and avoiding low-speed stride memory accesses. Our kernel applied to real applications achieves orders of magnitude boost in power&cost vs. performance metrics. The off-card bandwidth limitation is still an issue, which could be alleviated somewhat with application kernels confinement within the card, while ideal solution being facilitation of faster GPU interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5213210","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05213210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5213210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth intensive 3-D FFT kernel for GPUs using CUDA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5213210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213210/","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth intensive 3-D FFT kernel for GPUs using CUDA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10846507","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5213210/","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth intensive 3-D FFT kernel for GPUs using CUDA","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068622S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5213210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5213284,"authors":[{"name":"Eun Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Eun Cheol Kim","id":"38188696000"},{"name":"Jin Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communications Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Young Kim","id":"38190558400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4349-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5213284","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"In this paper, performance of double binary turbo coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is analyzed and simulated in power line communications (PLC) channel.

Its functionality includes image acquisition, feature recognition and extraction, data preprocessing (Analysis of Variance and Principal Component Analysis) and feature classification with neural networks (NN). The system is investigated in terms of statistical feature processing (number of features and dimensionality reduction techniques) and classifier design (NN architecture, topology, target coding, and complexity of training). We report system test and validation results of the recognition and classification tasks with up to 95% success rate. Some of those results are due to our investigation and combination of feature generation techniques: application of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which appeared to be very efficient for preprocessing the data; and use of suitable NN design and learning method. The employed NNs are trained with our genetic low-discrepancy search method (GLPtauS) for global optimisation. The obtained and reported results demonstrate strongly competitive nature when compared with results from other authors investigating similar systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213287","startPage":"232","endPage":"237","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05213287.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network classification: A cork industry case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Analysis of variance","Principal component analysis","Intelligent systems","Computer vision","Tiles","Computer industry","Image analysis","Feature extraction","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optimisation","production engineering computing","tiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network training","cork industry","intelligent computer vision system","tiles recognition","tiles classification","gray image processing","feature generation","feature analysis","image acquisition","feature recognition","feature extraction","data preprocessing","principal component analysis","variance analysis","genetic low-discrepancy search method","global optimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural networks","pattern recognition","image processing","feature extraction and classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural network classification: A cork industry case","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5213287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846774","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network classification: A cork industry case","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MA09-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05283S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5213287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5213290,"authors":[{"name":"Leo H.

Effective use of tiling requires selection and tuning of the tile sizes. This is usually achieved by developing cost models that characterize the performance of the tiled program as a function of tile sizes. All previous approaches to tile size selection (TSS) are cost model specific. Due to this they are neither extensible (e.g., to richer program classes/newer architectures) nor scalable (e.g., to multiple levels of tiling). This paper identifies positivity as a fundamental property shared by the functions and parameters commonly used in TSS models. We show how this positivity can be used as a basis to derive a TSS framework which is both efficient and scalable. We also show that almost all TSS models proposed in the literature (including those used in production compilers and auto-tuners) can be reduced to our framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10846481","htmlLink":"/document/5213293/","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Positivity, posynomials and tile size selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positivity, posynomials and tile size selection","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.166546S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5213293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5213296,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This article presents an overview of the Shannon theorem, interesting practical codes, and their application to the space channel. It turns out that a simple encoder in combination with a decoder of modest complexity placed into an uncoded communications system can increase the data rate by a factor of four or more depending on the coding scheme and the allowable error rate. Use of a convolutional code with sequential decoding has proved to be the outstanding scheme for these applications. It appears that, in the future, coding will find a place in most new digital space communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","volume":"7","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"Coding and its application in space communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding and its application in space communications","sourcePdf":"SPEC-v7-n6-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028951S","chronDate":"June  1970","isNumber":"5213398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"28","articleId":"5213419","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5213467,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The objective of this optimal process is to find a solution that maximizes the annual profit obtained from a wind farm. It is well-known that genetic algorithms are good for global searches, but are weak for local searches. To improve the performance of finding the optimal solution in a large search space, the hybrid methodology combines a distributed genetic algorithm and steepest ascent hill-climbing local search algorithms. The hill-climbing algorithm provides a powerful strategy for searching the local optimal solution by exploring the neighborhood of the current state. In this paper, the hill-climbing algorithm is further enhanced by a heuristic method to reduce the execution time for finding the optimal value. Test results show that this proposed hybrid distributed genetic algorithm adequately demonstrates its effectiveness in solution quality and execution time.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5213603","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2201","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial

I/O prefetching is considered to be effective in improving I/O performance. However, the effectiveness depends on determining patterns among future I/O accesses swiftly and fetching data in time, which is difficult to achieve in general. In this study, we propose an I/O signature-based prefetching strategy. The idea is to use a predetermined I/O signature of an application to guide prefetching. To put this idea to work, we first derived a classification of patterns and introduced a simple and effective signature notation to represent patterns. We then developed a toolkit to trace and generate I/O signatures automatically. Finally, we designed and implemented a thread-based client-side collective prefetching cache layer for MPI-IO library to support prefetching. A prefetching thread reads I/O signatures of an application and adjusts them by observing I/O accesses at runtime. Experimental results show that the proposed prefetching method improves I/O performance significantly for applications with complex patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10846511","htmlLink":"/document/5213604/","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parallel I/O prefetching using MPI file caching and I/O signatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel I/O prefetching using MPI file caching and I/O signatures","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06815S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5213604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5213674,"authors":[{"name":"William M.

Neither is attractive. But they would have had to do were it not for coherent wave radar-upon which synthetic-aperture radar is premised. Using coherent radar, resolution can depend, not on the width of the beam, but on Doppler frequency shift. The azimuthal resolution of side-looking radar can therefore be of the same order of magnitude as that for range resolution. The key to converting the theoretical groundwork into a ``full-bodied'' system is an appropriate data-processing scheme. And the simplest scheme for working, processing, and deciphering the data is optical.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5213674/","volume":"6","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to synthetic-aperture radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to synthetic-aperture radar","sourcePdf":"SPEC-v6-n9-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023035S","chronDate":"Sept.  1969","isNumber":"5213653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"117","articleId":"5213674","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5213757,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Wei","id":"37894412100"},{"name":"Wang Jing","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Jing","id":"38186405000"},{"name":"Li Donghai","affiliation":["Dept of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Donghai","id":"37545561600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4349-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5213757","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"abstract":"In this paper, a decentralized cascade robust control scheme is developed for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with lower triangular property and unknown nonlinearities.

The path obtained from a start to a goal is the shortest path in terms of the number of steps. The time-critical part of the algorithm is mapped on to a two-dimensional cellular architecture that consists of a locally interconnected array of identical processing elements. Due to this local interconnection and regular structure, the architecture can be operated at a high speed and is easily scalable. The design has been implemented on the XCV8000 device of Xilinx. The maximum frequency of operation obtained is 246 MHz. This leads to computing a collision-free path on images of size 100 times 100 in less than 41 mus. The hardware is capable of processing images at a video rate for real-time path planning in a dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214085","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05214085.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5214085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A vision-based path planning on a distance map and its cellular array VLSI architecture","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10859783","htmlLink":"/document/5214085/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision-based path planning on a distance map and its cellular array VLSI architecture","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MPI08-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054093S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5214085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5214175,"authors":[{"name":"Henning F.

One major drawback of the OFDM signal is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem. The high PAPR results in the in-band distortion and out-of-band radiation when the OFDM signal is fed into a nonlinear power amplifier (PA). In this paper, we propose a partition dummy sequence insertion (PDSI) method to reduce the PAPR problem and compare with the DSI method. Simulation results of the PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) performance for the proposed method are performed to demonstrate its capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214355","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05214355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparisons of PAPR reduction methods for the OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5214355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparisons of PAPR reduction methods for the OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5214355/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846808","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5214355/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparisons of PAPR reduction methods for the OFDM system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TPII07-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06259S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5214355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5214359,"authors":[{"name":"Vasily Volkov","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Vasily","lastName":"Volkov","id":"37690342900"},{"name":"James W.

Our matrix-matrix multiply routine (GEMM) runs up to 60% faster than the vendor's implementation and approaches the peak of hardware capabilities. Our LU, QR and Cholesky factorizations achieve up to 80-90% of the peak GEMM rate. Our parallel LU running on two GPUs achieves up to ~540 Gflop/s. These results are accomplished by challenging the accepted view of the GPU architecture and programming guidelines. We argue that modern GPUs should be viewed as multithreaded multicore vector units. We exploit blocking similarly to vector computers and heterogeneity of the system by computing both on GPU and CPU. This study includes detailed benchmarking of the GPU memory system that reveals sizes and latencies of caches and TLB. We present a couple of algorithmic optimizations aimed at increasing parallelism and regularity in the problem that provide us with slightly higher performance.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5214359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5214359","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05214359.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking GPUs to tune dense linear algebra","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5214359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking GPUs to tune dense linear algebra","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10846485","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5214359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking GPUs to tune dense linear algebra","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07757S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"384","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5214359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5214427,"authors":[{"name":"Gin-Der Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Gin-Der Wu","id":"37557049300"},{"name":"Yi-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37898520200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4349-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5214427","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory architecture","Pipelines","Computer architecture","Energy consumption","Clocks","Hardware","Asynchronous circuits","Speech processing","Delay","Communication industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","memory architecture","microprocessor chips","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radix-22 based low power reconfigurable FFT processor","fast Fourier transform","power saving","power consumption","memory-based architecture"]}],"abstract":"Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is widely applied in the speech processing, image processing, and communication system.

Our approach leverages histogram-based parallel coordinates for both visual information display as well as a vehicle for guiding a data mining operation. Data extraction and subsetting are implemented with state-of-the-art index/query technology.

In this paper, damping controllers for a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) System with STATic synchronous COMpensator (STATCOM) are designed using swarm intelligence. The controller design problem is formulated as an optimization problem where Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to find optimal controller parameters. Nonlinear time domain simulation based multi-objective function is formulated to minimize time-weighted errors in order to damp system oscillations of the nonlinear system model. The effectiveness of the designed controllers is examined under severe system disturbances. The results show that the system performance with the proposed controllers is quite satisfactory and confirm the quality of the damping characteristics of the designed PSO based controllers.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214495","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1223","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5214495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05214495.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STATCOM based controller design using Particle Swarm Optimization for power system stability enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5214495/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"STATCOM based controller design using Particle Swarm Optimization for power system stability enhancement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5214495/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10846767","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STATCOM based controller design using Particle Swarm Optimization for power system stability enhancement","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TPI09-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052465S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5214495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5214506,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Chin Jong","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Chin Jong","id":"37901403300"},{"name":"Hen-Wai Tsao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hen-Wai Tsao","id":"37277278800"},{"name":"San-Liang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"San-Liang Lee","id":"37281130600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4102-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4103-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-8884"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-8892"}],"articleNumber":"5214506","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Radio frequency","RF signals","Optical modulation","System performance","Nonlinear distortion","Optical receivers","Degradation","Absorption","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical devices","OFDM modulation","radio-over-fibre","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal","radio-over-fiber link","electroabsorption modulator","nonlinear distortion","802.11a standard"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the nonlinear distortion in an OFDM-RoF link employing EAM.

The interatomic forces are computed on the Cells (each with one PPU and eight SPU cores), while the Opterons are used to direct inter-rank communication and perform I/O-heavy periodic analysis, visualization, and checkpointing tasks. The performance measured for our initial implementation of a standard Lennard-Jones pair potential benchmark reached a peak of 369 Tflop/s double-precision floating-point performance on the full Roadrunner system (27.7% of peak), corresponding to 124 MFlop/Watt/s at a price of approximately 3.69 MFlops/dollar.

Inspired by the programming interface of Google's MapReduce, we have built a new parallel analysis framework called HiMach, which allows users to write trajectory analysis programs sequentially, and carries out the parallel execution of the programs automatically. We introduce (1) a new MD trajectory data analysis model that is amenable to parallel processing, (2) a new interface for defining trajectories to be analyzed, (3) a novel method to make use of an existing sequential analysis tool called VMD, and (4) an extension to the original MapReduce model to support multiple rounds of analysis.

However, effective use of GPUs in clusters presents a number of application development and system integration challenges. We describe strategies for the decomposition and scheduling of computation among CPU cores and GPUs, and techniques for overlapping communication and CPU computation with GPU kernel execution. We report the adaptation of these techniques to NAMD, a widely-used parallel molecular dynamics simulation package, and present performance results for a 64-core 64-GPU cluster.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapting a message-driven parallel application to GPU-accelerated clusters","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5214716","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05214716.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5214716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5214716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5214716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adapting a message-driven parallel application to GPU-accelerated clusters","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5214716/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10846475","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting a message-driven parallel application to GPU-accelerated clusters","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092389S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5214716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5214722,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto F.

A skip-lot cost model is developed by considering production costs, appraisal costs, and failure costs. The optimal inspection plan minimizing the average cost per good unit is characterized by the sample size, the acceptance number, and the inspection interval. Numerical evaluation of the model is discussed; a computer program facilitates the evaluation. When inspection is destructive, the lot-by-lot inspection procedure may not be the most economical. An optimal inspection plan can be designed by using skip-lot approach.

Operating life-tests at 125\u00b0C indicated excellent stability of electrical characteristics of both n-channel and p-channel transistors. Over three million device-hours of accelerated operating life-tests indicated a calculated failure rate, at a 60-percent s-confidence level, of 0.08%/1000 hours at 125\u00b0C, which corresponds to 0.01%/1000 hours at 55\u00b0C or 0.003%/1000 hours at 25\u00b0C. Field-usage reliability data on three satellites in orbit indicate a total failure rate of 0.003%/1000 hours (over thirty-four million operating hours with no failures). The observed failure rates are compared with other available data on IC reliability, and it is concluded that the reliability of CMOS ICs is equal to that of p-channel MOS circuits or of bipolar digital circuits of equal complexity, when each type is prepared by a well-controlled process, and operated at the same temperature. The operating temperature of CMOS IC chips in electronic systems is, however, generally lower since logic functions are accomplished at lower dissipation per gate.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1975.5215182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5215170/05215182.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1975.5215182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5215170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of Complementary MOS Integrated Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5215182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215182/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of Complementary MOS Integrated Circuits","volume":"R-24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of Complementary MOS Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-24-n4-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056327S","chronDate":"Oct.  1975","isNumber":"5215170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5215182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5215244,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The inversion of the current is chosen at times which are a decreasing fraction of the specimen life in DC. While under DC current, the resistance of the specimen increases continuously up to failure; when the current is reversed, the resistance decreases to some extent in the first period after inversion, and then increases again, thus showing the partial reversibility of the effect. A large increase in life is observed on specimens in which the current is alternatingly inverted. A model of electromigration damage due mainly to vacancy condensation is presented, in which the behavior of resistance change is derived from the kinetics of void formation. This model is in very good agreement with the experimental results. However, the partial reversibility of the effect corresponding to the small decrease in resistance upon current inversion, suggests that some change also occurs in the shape of the specimen due to mass transport and polarization associated with the impurities present at some internal sites, such as grain boundaries.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5215226/05215244.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"202","doi":"10.1109/TR.1974.5215244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1974.5215244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5215226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromigration Failure in A1 Thin Films under Constant and Reversed DC Powering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1974","displayDocTitle":"Electromigration Failure in A1 Thin Films under Constant and Reversed DC Powering","publicationDate":"Aug. 1974","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"R-23","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromigration Failure in A1 Thin Films under Constant and Reversed DC Powering","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-23-n3-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037056S","chronDate":"Aug.  1974","isNumber":"5215226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5215244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5215343,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

A fundamental challenge in global seismology is to model the propagation of waves with periods between 1 and 2 seconds, the highest frequency signals that can propagate clear across the Earth. These waves help reveal the 3D structure of the Earth's deep interior and can be compared to seismographic recordings. We broke the 2 second barrier using the 62K processor Ranger system at TACC. Indeed we broke the barrier using just half of Ranger, by reaching a period of 1.84 seconds with sustained 28.7 Tflops on 32K processors. We obtained similar results on the XT4 Franklin system at NERSC and the XT4 Kraken system at University of Tennessee Knoxville, while a similar run on the 28K processor Jaguar system at ORNL, which has better memory bandwidth per processor, sustained 35.7 Tflops (a higher flops rate) with a 1.94 shortest period.Thus we have enabled a powerful new tool for seismic wave simulation, one that operates in the same frequency regimes as nature; in seismology there is no need to pursue periods much smaller because higher frequency signals do not propagate across the entire globe.We employed performance modeling methods to identify performance bottlenecks and worked through issues of parallel I/O and scalability. Improved mesh design and numbering results in excellent load balancing and few cache misses. The primary achievements are not just the scalability and high teraflops number, but a historic step towards understanding the physics and chemistry of the Earth's interior at unprecedented resolution.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5215501","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05215501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5215501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency simulations of global seismic wave propagation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on 62K processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5215501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215501/","displayDocTitle":"High-frequency simulations of global seismic wave propagation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on 62K processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10859630","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5215501/","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency simulations of global seismic wave propagation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on 62K processors","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"gb109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081637S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5215501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5215637,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The focus has been on finding solutions for integration of distributed power electronics systems. Distributed systems set new requirements for control systems compared with the traditional centralized solutions. Using intelligent power electronics building blocks as a basis for power electronics systems results in reduced cost, easier reconfiguration, and improved reliability. A cascaded ring topology has become a prominent control solution. In many applications, accurate synchronization of the building blocks is of crucial importance; it is therefore essential to understand the factors that affect the synchronization accuracy. This paper addresses ring topology synchronization methods and the factors that define the overall synchronization accuracy. A new time-stamping-based synchronization method is presented, and its accuracy and jitter behavior are analyzed. Experimental results of synchronization jitter of the proposed method are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power electronics","Circuit topology","Motion control","Centralized control","Power system reliability","Optical control","Communication system control","Propagation delay","Intelligent structures","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topology","power electronics","synchronisation","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-stamping-based synchronization","PEBB system","distributed power electronics systems","intelligent power electronics building blocks","jitter behavior","ring topology synchronization methods","cascaded ring topology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5215658","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05215658.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5215658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of time-stamping-based synchronization of a PEBB system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5215658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of time-stamping-based synchronization of a PEBB system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215658/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5215658/","accessionNumber":"10846813","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of time-stamping-based synchronization of a PEBB system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MA01-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072919S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5215658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5215659,"authors":[{"name":"Linghao Cheng","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Linghao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280493100"},{"name":"Zhaohui Li","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zhaohui Li","id":"37087169832"},{"name":"Yanfu Yang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yanfu Yang","id":"37087475161"},{"name":"Chao Lu","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chao Lu","id":"37087151166"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Fang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Yuanyuan Fang","id":"37087542232"},{"name":"Hua Jiang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Hua Jiang","id":"37088628997"},{"name":"Xiaogeng Xu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Xiaogeng Xu","id":"37087275952"},{"name":"Qianjin Xiong","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Qianjin Xiong","id":"37087200026"},{"name":"Shengqian Zhong","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Shengqian Zhong","id":"37087723104"},{"name":"Zheng Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Chen","id":"37088628990"},{"name":"H.

paper. The overall controller is comprised of a feedback controller and multiple FNNs which learn inverse dynamics of the robot manipulator for different tasks. The multiple FNNs are switched or blended to improve the transient response when manipulating objects are changed. The structure and parameters of the FNNs are determined dynamically using an incremental learning algorithm which reduces complexity and computation induced by the use of multiple models considerably. The parameters are refined online to compensate for uncertainties. The closed-loop system with a switching or blending law is proven to be stable in Lyapunov sense. The proposed scheme is applied to control a two-link robot manipulator with varying payloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215661/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10846815","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5215661/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive robot control based on multiple incremental fuzzy neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive robot control based on multiple incremental fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MPI09-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061606S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5215661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5215688,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

It will be shown that the ranging precision can be significantly improved by the proposed chirp ranging system.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5215880","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1171","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5215880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05215880.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based ranging technique for chirp pulse detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5215880/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based ranging technique for chirp pulse detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5215880/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10859722","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based ranging technique for chirp pulse detection","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TPI07-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092936S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5215880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5215881,"authors":[{"name":"Xueguang Yuan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xueguang Yuan","id":"37403854100"},{"name":"Jinnan Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jinnan Zhang","id":"37540260900"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoguang Zhang","id":"37279341100"},{"name":"Yang'an Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yang'an Zhang","id":"38247941300"},{"name":"Minglun Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Minglun Zhang","id":"37539173400"},{"name":"Yongqing Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongqing Huang","id":"37335703800"},{"name":"Xiaomin Ren","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Communication and Lightwave Technologies, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaomin Ren","id":"37330159800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4102-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4103-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-8884"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-8892"}],"articleNumber":"5215881","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical polarization","Monitoring","Optical fiber communication","Optical feedback","Optical distortion","High speed optical techniques","Optical fiber polarization","Logic","Voltage","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light polarisation","optical dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed polarization monitoring","adaptive PMD compensation","optical communication systems"]}],"abstract":"A high speed polarization monitoring unit for adaptive PMD compensation is designed and implemented.

Redundancy frequently proves too expensive (introducing additional systems faults) and the traditional memory coding techniques have been limited to those areas of memory where a single fault results in a single failure (e.g., a broken core in a magnetic memory) as distinguished from an address decoder fault. To take an integrated approach to this problem, using a variety of coding and modularization techniques on each of the memory subsystems, it is necessary to determine the types of faults and failures caused by these faults that could occur in the system. This paper presents the results of a failure analysis study of typical 2D, 2\u00bdD, and 3D memory organizations. Two-way memories are also considered. This study demonstrates that a 2D memory, utilizing a switching array for memory access, is less susceptible to eatastrophic failures than other organizations considered. A memory organization capable of distributing the failures, in a manner permitting correction by linear codes, was adopted. Other techniques for automatic replacement of fault units are also considered.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1971.5216086","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5216077/05216086.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1971.5216086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5216077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure Analysis of Memory Organization for Utilization in a Self-Repair Memory System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5216086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1971","displayDocTitle":"Failure Analysis of Memory Organization for Utilization in a Self-Repair Memory System","volume":"R-20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"May 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure Analysis of Memory Organization for Utilization in a Self-Repair Memory System","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-20-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023339S","chronDate":"May  1971","isNumber":"5216077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5216086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5216111,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

The codes used or suggested for the memory system are discussed, emphasis being placed on parity check codes, two-dimensional codes, Hamming codes and other recently developed codes. The various codes used in the input/output system are presented. The input/output area of the computer system is relatively unreliable as compared with CPU or memory; therefore, error-correcting codes used in this area usually are much more powerful than single parity check codes.

In this article, which is tutorial in nature, the basic theory of proportional navigation is presented and clarified. In addition, two variations on this guidance method are treated: one in which the commanded acceleration is biased by a small value of the measured rotational rate of the line of sight between the interceptor and its target, and one in which the line-of-sight rotational rate is reduced to a prescribed value (dead space) and then maintained at this rate until intercept. The analysis is directed, by example, to the case of the exoatmospheric interception of a satellite; however, the guidance theory presented is also applicable to the intercept of a nonmaneuvering airborne target.","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.1966.5217080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/5217052/05217080.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1966.5217080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5217052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamentals of proportional navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5217080","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5217080/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamentals of proportional navigation","volume":"3","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamentals of proportional navigation","sourcePdf":"SPEC-v3-n12-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037026S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"5217052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"189","articleId":"5217080","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":5217126,"authors":[{"name":"William R.

By means of suitable reliability models and simple analysis, the effect of error correcting coding of memory words on the overall reliability of the system is discussed. Introduction of error correcting facilities will generally have three significant effects on the system: 1) increased hardware, which is also subject to failures and hence tends to lower reliability; 2) the system's ability to function in the presence of a certain class of failures; and 3) quicker detection of errors, which also means an improved repair rate. To illustrate the extent to which the above three factors govern the reliability improvement due to coding, three types of systems are considered. These systems use the same basic processor and memory units but differ in their structure and complexity.

In this paper we present a detailed architectural description of Roadrunner and a detailed performance analysis of the system. A case study of optimizing the MPI-based application Sweep3D to exploit Roadrunner's hybrid architecture is also included. The performance of Sweep3D is compared to that of the code on a previous implementation of the Cell Broadband Engine architecture-the Cell BE-and on multi-core processors. Using validated performance models combined with Roadrunner-specific microbenchmarks we identify performance issues in the early pre-delivery system and infer how well the final Roadrunner configuration will perform once the system software stack has matured.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5217926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5217926","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05217926.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entering the petaflop era: The architecture and performance of Roadrunner","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5217926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Entering the petaflop era: The architecture and performance of Roadrunner","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10859629","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5217926/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entering the petaflop era: The architecture and performance of Roadrunner","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086377S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5217926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5217932,"authors":[{"name":"Ewa Deelman","affiliation":["USC Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ewa","lastName":"Deelman","id":"37276642300"},{"name":"Gurmeet Singh","affiliation":["USC Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gurmeet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37278593000"},{"name":"Miron Livny","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Miron","lastName":"Livny","id":"37267793400"},{"name":"Bruce Berriman","affiliation":["Infrared Processing and Analysis Center & Michelson Science Center, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Berriman","id":"38557649600"},{"name":"John Good","affiliation":["Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Good","id":"38556460800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2834-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2835-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"5217932","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":367,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Cloud computing","Grid computing","Information analysis","Marine technology","Optical computing","Collaborative work","Permission","Computer applications","Astronomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","information retrieval","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility grids","Amazon EC2 cloud","Amazon S3","data-intensive applications","communication resources","Amazon cloud fee structure","real-life astronomy application","cost performance tradeoffs","resource provisioning plans","data archival"]}],"abstract":"Utility grids such as the Amazon EC2 cloud and Amazon S3 offer computational and storage resources that can be used on-demand for a fee by compute and data-intensive applications. The cost of running an application on such a cloud depends on the compute, storage and communication resources it will provision and consume. Different execution plans of the same application may result in significantly different costs. Using the Amazon cloud fee structure and a real-life astronomy application, we study via simulation the cost performance tradeoffs of different execution and resource provisioning plans. We also study these trade-offs in the context of the storage and communication fees of Amazon S3 when used for long-term application data archival.

The active clamp circuit is employed to limit the voltage stress and create zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on feature for power switches. Moreover, the dual resonant tanks are composed by the leakage inductors and resonant capacitors to achieve zero-current-switching (ZCS) turn-off mechanism for diodes at the secondary side of transformer. Hence, the reverse-recovery problem can be eliminated. The operational principles, design consideration and realization are discussed. Finally, experimental results from a 400W prototype are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Prechlorination process removes many colloids such as NH3, iron, manganese, algae and bacteria. However, this process is carried out by human's hand with their experience practically. This plant is composed of complex structures, so chlorine input rate has been only determined by the time of day when human control the plant. In this paper, we propose fuzzy logic controller for prechlorination control and enhanced compact genetic algorithm for optimizing parameters of fuzzy logic controller. It shows better performance compared as previous works in simulation works.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218132","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05218132.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"231","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prechlorination control using fuzzy logic and enhanced compact genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5218132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Prechlorination control using fuzzy logic and enhanced compact genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10859806","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5218132/","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prechlorination control using fuzzy logic and enhanced compact genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MA09-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034696S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5218132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5218177,"authors":[{"name":"Shigeki Watanabe","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280301600"},{"name":"Fumio Futami","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Fumio Futami","id":"37087643015"},{"name":"Ryo Okabe","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Ryo Okabe","id":"37087860559"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Kato","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Tomoyuki Kato","id":"37087824595"},{"name":"Reinhold Ludwig","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Reinhold","lastName":"Ludwig","id":"37266434600"},{"name":"Carsten Schmidt-Langhorst","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Schmidt-Langhorst","id":"38271553500"},{"name":"Colja Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Colja","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265973400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4102-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4103-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-8884"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-8892"}],"articleNumber":"5218177","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber polarization","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical pumping","Optical saturation","Stimulated emission","Optical polarization","Optical fiber amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Nonlinear optics","Brillouin scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light polarisation","optical communication equipment","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication","optical limiters","optical parametric amplifiers","optical saturation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization-independent all-optical amplitude limiter","two-stage gain-saturated fiber parametric amplifier","polarization-diversity configured OPA","amplitude level equalizing effect","bit rate 40 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5218177","doi":"10.1109/OECC.2009.5218177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OECC.2009.5218177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5212811","publicationTitle":"2009 14th OptoElectronics and Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 14th OptoElectronics and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5204038/5212811/05218177.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization-independent all-optical amplitude limiter using two-stage gain-saturated fiber parametric amplifiers","abstract":"A polarization-independent optical limiter is proposed using two-stage polarization-diversity configured optical parametric amplifiers in gain-saturated condition.

and real-time processing of motion-vision functions are of utmost importance. Robot decision making and motion control are commonly based on visual information in industrial machine vision applications. However, conventional processors are inadequate for such real-time processing since they are not designed primarily to perform repetitive operations on a large amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new embedded system that performs motion-vision functions in real-time using a dedicated, integrated processor. By employing both conventional and a dedicated processor, we were able to design a motion-vision integrated system that is both efficient and versatile.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218259","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05218259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","startPage":"700","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based motion-vision integrated system for real-time machine vision applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5218259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based motion-vision integrated system for real-time machine vision applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5218259/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846797","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5218259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based motion-vision integrated system for real-time machine vision applications","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MPII09-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052961S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5218259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5218260,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Cecati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Cecati","id":"37272395200"},{"name":"Fabrizio Ciancetta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of L' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Ciancetta","id":"37273683300"},{"name":"Pierluigi Siano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Siano","id":"37276646600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4349-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5218260","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Fuzzy logic","Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation","Voltage","Photovoltaic systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Switches","Pi control","Proportional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","fuzzy logic","H-bridge multilevel converter","fuzzy logic controller","modulator","VHDL","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the authors present a H-bridge multilevel converter governed by an integrated fuzzy logic controller/modulator implemented using VHDL and FPGA.

He screamed, and woke, then thanked the dad, whose fertile mind had fathered CAD.'' This special report surveys the current revolution in computer-aided design systems and services for semiconductor design, layout, and fabrication. Recent breakthroughs in turnkey products-especially in low-cost terminal design-have permitted semiconductor houses that heretofore could not afford CAD to achieve error-free designs and eliminate much of the layout drudgery. Greater efficiency in design and better yields in production are just two of the benefits of these design aids.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer aids for IC design, artwork, and mask

(CMOS Image Sensors: CIS) by applying characteristics of noise distribution on time domain. The algorithm using time domain or stacking images which are focused on same pixel position are proposed to make up for the weakness of general method on edge region. Nevertheless, in the case of using of self-pixel position, some problems such as blocking effect or acquisition of images are occurred. In this study, we propose the algorithm 3D weighted filtering using multi-images through noise distribution. By using weight value on the center pixel of each 2D masks, the optimized algorithm is implemented. The purpose of proposed method is to obtain the best PSNR with minimum number of frame and minimum weight value. We have used White Gaussian noise distribution because 1/f noise has that distribution. Through the proposed algorithm, we have obtained the better PSNR than other methods as a masking method, Wiener filter and self pixel based method. The algorithm is expected that is effective for other random noise likes as photon shot noise with Poisson distribution.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218887","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05218887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5218887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","startPage":"575","endPage":"580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the 3D-weighted filtering for the 1/f noise reduction on CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5218887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study on the 3D-weighted filtering for the 1/f noise reduction on CMOS image sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5218887/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10846827","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5218887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the 3D-weighted filtering for the 1/f noise reduction on CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MPII04-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060561S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5218887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5218897,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Eng Aik","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Mathematic, Universiti Malaysia Pedis, Perlis, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Lim Eng Aik","id":"37087849744"},{"name":"Zarita Zainuddin","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Science, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Minden, Penang, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Zarita Zainuddin","id":"37087850696"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4347-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4349-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"5218897","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Cameras","Data mining","Costs","Feature extraction","Industrial electronics","Mathematics","Intelligent networks","Uninterruptible power systems","Tellurium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","neural nets","object detection","probability","traffic engineering computing","video cameras","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernelized probabilistic neural network","intelligent pedestrian counting system","video camera","image processing","image classification","object detection","feature extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5218897","abstract":"An improved, intelligent pedestrian counting system, using images obtained from a single video camera, is described in this paper.

The fundamental idea in this study is to find methods for selection of these assignments in which each binary variable describing the new state depends on as few variables of the old state as possible. In general, these variable assignments in which the dependence is reduced yield more economical implementation for the sequential machine than the assignments in which the dependence is not reduced. The main tool used in this study is the partition with the substitution property on the set of states of a sequential machine. It is shown that for a sequential machine the existence of assignments with reduced dependence is very closely connected with the existence of partitions with the substitution property on the set of states of the machine. It is shown how to determine these partitions for a given sequential machine and how they can be used to obtain assignments with reduced dependence.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1961.5219184","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219177/05219184.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1961.5219184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the State Assignment Problem for Sequential Machines.

After outlining, in block diagram form, one possible physical realization of a serial system, the paper examines the conditions under which such a store is economically justified. The distinguishing feature of the system discussed is that coincidence is established in the memory matrix between two currents representing an address signal and a time signal, respectively. Studies of the characteristics and economics of serio-parallel devices are however not reported in detail. It is shown how the properties of the time-controlled serial store may lead to the adoption of a word-asynchronous design for serial digital computers. In such a machine, timing is not controlled or determined by limited store access. As examples, the paper indicates how the serial techniques facilitate the incorporation into small serial computers, of autonomous transfers, automatic floating point operations, high speed multiplication, division and shift orders and asynchronous transfers between, say, a high speed store and a magnetic drum.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1961.5219195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1961.5219195","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219177/05219195.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Serial Matrix Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1961","displayDocTitle":"Serial Matrix Storage Systems","volume":"EC-10","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1961","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219195/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serial Matrix Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n2-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033839S","chronDate":"June  1961","isNumber":"5219177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5219195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219196,"authors":[{"name":"Frank F.

A comparatively low-cost equipment for monitoring a maximum of 64 boxes in a flow diagram has been constructed. The monitoring method is flexible and convenient in its application. It can be used in connection with relative or symbolic addresses, compilers, etc. The user must provide only a flow diagram drawn on translucent paper in a certain form and the information to correlate this diagram with the computing program. A subroutine modifies the computing program as needed for the monitoring purpose and restores it to its original form when the user so desires. The monitoring introduces only a very small increase in computing time, requiring for each call-up of a box in the flow diagram only a time amounting to that needed for two simple unconditional jumps. The monitor can be used to present during the computation a visual dynamic picture of the progress of the program and to register, on occurrence, the whereabouts of an interruption, thus facilitating the tracing of the error. The principle of the monitoring method and the subroutine program, and the essentials of the constructed monitor equipment, are described in detail.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1961.5219196","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219177/05219196.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1961.5219196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible and Inexpensive Method of Monitoring Program Execution in a Digital Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1961","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible and Inexpensive Method of Monitoring Program Execution in a Digital Computer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219196/","publicationDate":"June 1961","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible and Inexpensive Method of Monitoring Program Execution in a Digital Computer","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n2-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017168S","chronDate":"June  1961","isNumber":"5219177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","articleId":"5219196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219197,"authors":[{"name":"Herbert Freeman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Freeman","id":"38192037300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-9950"}],"articleNumber":"5219197","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1078,"citationCountPatent":24,"totalDownloads":1884},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Lakes","Senior members","Computer displays","Communication system control","Equations","Decoding","Telegraphy","Polynomials","Availability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219197","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219177/05219197.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1961.5219197","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1961.5219197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219177","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Encoding of Arbitrary Geometric Configurations","abstract":"A method is described which permits the encoding of arbitrary geometric configurations so as to facilitate their analysis and manipulation by means of a digital computer. It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1961","volume":"EC-10","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 1961","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Encoding of Arbitrary Geometric Configurations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Encoding of Arbitrary Geometric Configurations","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n2-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020155S","chronDate":"June  1961","isNumber":"5219177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"1078","articleId":"5219197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5219222,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results are highly encouraging. Within our framework, we are able to solve the following types of problems: 1) To find a path between two points so that it crosses the least number of existing paths. 2) To find a path between two points so that it avoids as much as possible preset obstacles such as edges. 3) To find a path between two points so that the path is optimal with respect to several properties; for example, a path which is not only one of those which cross the fewest number of existing paths, but, among these, is also one of the shortest. The minimal-distance solution has been programmed on an IBM 704 computer, and a number of illustrations are presented. The class of problems solvable by our algorithm is given in a theorem in Section III. A byproduct of this algorithm is a somewhat remote, but unexpected, relation to physical optics.

Carry-propagation chains are eliminated by the use of redundant representations for the operands. Redundancy in the number representation allows a method of fast addition and subtraction in which each sum (or difference) digit is the function only of the digits in two adjacent digital positions of the operands. The addition time for signed-digit numbers of any length is equal to the addition time for two digits. The paper discusses the properties of signed-digit representations and arithmetic operations with signed-digit numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and roundoff.

In essence, this method involves maximizing the cross-correlation value between the unknown character and a set of average characters, there being one average character for each allowed character class. An average character is represented by a two-dimensional function. The value of this function at a point is the probability of occurrence of a mark at that point for the character class represented by the average character. Negative weights are given to areas of low probability in each average character to improve discriminability. The simulation results indicate that this method is applicable to the recognition of machine printing, and perhaps to the recognition of constrained hand printing. The method can be implemented in an economical manner using electro-optical techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1961.5219239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1961.5219239","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219217/05219239.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analog Method for Character Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1961","displayDocTitle":"An Analog Method for Character Recognition","volume":"EC-10","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1961","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analog Method for Character Recognition","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n3-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058641S","chronDate":"Sept.  1961","isNumber":"5219217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"27","articleId":"5219239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219242,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A switching function is defined as any mapping of a set of binary input combinations onto 0 and 1. Hence, the procedures apply equally well to the don't care cases. The method rests on the concept alogically passive function (LPF). Roughly speaking, an LPF is a truth table which can be realized with only AND and OR gates-no inverters. Techniques are described for 1) making a function logically passive, 2) eliminating rows and columns from the truth table of an LPF, 3) synthesizing an LPF in a two-level irredundant form, 4) expanding LPF's and 5) synthesizing LPF's with 3-input majority gates. The underlying methods are quite straightforward and appear to be particularly well suited for mechanization on a digital computer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219266/","volume":"EC-10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Truth Table Method for the Synthesis of Combinational Logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Truth Table Method for the Synthesis of Combinational Logic","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017897S","chronDate":"Dec.  1961","isNumber":"5219260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5219266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5219271,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Strobe addressing for drums or disks costs less than 20 per cent of conventional addressing for real-time control programs, but becomes impractical for very complex problems. A comparison of various forms of strobe and conventional addressing shows that simple strobe addressing uses the memory as efficiently as conventional addressing if the problem can and must be solved in one revolution. By interlacing instructions with complete freedom for the program to switch interlaces, a strobe-addressed drum appears to have as many parallel bands as it has interlaces, thereby extending the advantages of strobe-addressing to more complex problems. Only minor changes in the program memory are necessary, and the arithmetic element and control unit remain essentially unchanged. The irregular interlace organization is described for an airborne computer with an 8-fold interlace, and its effectiveness is evaluated. In a test problem, this method reduces the size of the required memory by a factor of four and increases the effective computing speed fourfold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219280/","volume":"EC-10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Drum Organization for Strobe Addressing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drum Organization for Strobe Addressing","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-10-n4-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02312S","chronDate":"Dec.  1961","isNumber":"5219260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5219280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5219316,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Tables of pre-computed constants are utilized in transforming the argument into a range where the function may be approximated by a simpler polynomial. In the case of ln x, x is transformed so that it falls into a close neighborhood of 1; in the case of exp x, x is transformed to a close neighborhood of 0. These algorithms are particularly effective when mechanized so as to carry out the predetermined sequence of operations without waste manipulation. Such special purpose organization is reasonable within the variable structure part of UCLA's proposed Fixed-Plus-Variable structure computer, as the same equipment may be reorganized for use in other special purpose configurations at other times. In this paper the sequential table look-up algorithms and their speed advantages over existing subroutine approximation procedures are described. The design of special purpose configurations which leads to another factor of speed increase as compared to a stored program implementation of the algorithms is presented. The properties of the supervisory control which integrate the operation of the ``fixed structure'' general purpose computer and the ``variable structure'' special purpose configurations are specified and the over-all computational gains evaluated. An order-of-magnitude increase in speed compared to existing subroutines is predicted in both cases.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1962.5219348","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219340/05219348.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1962.5219348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logarithmic and Exponential Function Evaluation in a Variable Structure Digital Computer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1962","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1962","displayDocTitle":"Logarithmic and Exponential Function Evaluation in a Variable Structure Digital Computer","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","volume":"EC-11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1962","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logarithmic and Exponential Function Evaluation in a Variable Structure Digital Computer","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-11-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066272S","chronDate":"April  1962","isNumber":"5219340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5219348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5219356,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The method is applicable to both completely and incompletely specified state tables, and permits the use of redundant internal variables if desired. An algorithm which implements the method approximately, and which is nonenumerative, has been programmed for the 7090 computer. The program handles problems with up to 100 internal states and 30 input symbols, or 3000 total states. It has performed a problem of maximum size in 120 seconds. Although fast, the method sometimes fails to attain truly economical logic in cases where unusually simple realizations are known to exist (e.g., the shift register). More comprehensive methods are now known, which in principle can produce better results, but which will be far more tedious to execute. They will be reported separately.","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219379/05219385.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"472","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1962.5219385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1962.5219385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Programmed Algorithm for Assigning Internal Codes to Sequential Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation economics","Boolean functions","Input variables","Shift registers","Binary codes","Logic circuits","Switching circuits","Telephony"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1962","displayDocTitle":"A Programmed Algorithm for Assigning Internal Codes to Sequential Machines","volume":"EC-11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Programmed Algorithm for Assigning Internal Codes to Sequential Machines","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-11-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039093S","chronDate":"Aug.  1962","isNumber":"5219379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"58","articleId":"5219385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5219386,"authors":[{"name":"I.

(A solution is a set of rows such that every column contains at least one marked entry in a row belonging to the set and such that no row can be deleted from the set without destroying this property.) Extensive use is made of the relationship between this and the problem of efficiently reducing a Boolean frontal function from the form of a product of sums of single literals to a sum of products. The transformation methods commonly in use today have the disadvantage that they tend to introduce duplicate and redundant products. (A redundant product includes at least one row which can be removed, and the remaining rows will still constitute a solution.) Several methods which appreciably reduce the number of such redundancies are presented. One of these methods (called row branching), applies repeatedly the algebraic transformation f = af(\u03b1 = 1) + f(\u03bc= 0) where \u03bc is the Boolean variable corresponding to a row of the table, and f is the function corresponding to the given table. The mechanism by which a redundant solution is generated is described. The paper includes other useful transformation procedures such as, for example, a tabular method in which redundancies are avoided systematically at each step.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1962","publicationDate":"Aug. 1962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","volume":"EC-11","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Reduction of Redundancy in Solving Prime Implicant Tables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Reduction of Redundancy in Solving Prime Implicant Tables","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-11-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034617S","chronDate":"Aug.  1962","isNumber":"5219379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"26","articleId":"5219386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5219387,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Grasselli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Istituto di Elettrotecnica Generale, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Grasselli","id":"37392199100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-9950"}],"articleNumber":"5219387","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Circuit synthesis","Clocks","Sequential circuits","Digital control","Process control","Electric variables control","Telephony"]}],"abstract":"Sequential circuits techniques for the synthesis of digital-computer-control units are investigated.

A binary matrix representation of signal is used in this paper. A nearest-neighbor dependence method is obtained by going beyond the usual assumption of statistical independence. The recognition network consists of three levels-a layer of AND gates, a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer. The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares favorably with other recognition schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1962.5219431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1962.5219431","startPage":"683","endPage":"690","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219418/05219431.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recognition Method Using Neighbor Dependence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1962","displayDocTitle":"A Recognition Method Using Neighbor Dependence","volume":"EC-11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recognition Method Using Neighbor Dependence","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-11-n5-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029016S","chronDate":"Oct.  1962","isNumber":"5219418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"44","articleId":"5219431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219459,"authors":[{"name":"Hisao Yamada","affiliation":["IBM Thomas j.

Within the field, character structure can be further specified: these processing entities, called bytes, may be from one to eight bits long. Fields may be stored with or without algebraic sign. On all operations, the relative offset or shift between the operand from memory and that from the accumulator can be specified. Besides the arithmetic operations, three new logical instructions allow any of the sixteen logical connectives of two variables to operate upon each pair of bits in the memory and accumulator operands. The variable field length, variable byte-size features, extend the use of connective operations to a surprisingly wide variety of logical, house-keeping, and editing tasks. These arithmetic and connective instructions are general and powerful programming tools which greatly simplify complex manipulations. Programming of typical tasks, with both the new instructions and with the instruction set of a conventionally-organized computer, has shown that the new set requires substantially fewer instructions to be written, stored, and executed. Furthermore, the new instruction set has considerably fewer distinct operations than the more conventional set. This is possible because the general-purpose instructions of the new set replace many ad hoc instructions which deal with pieces of instructions or data words, or which perform shifting, packing, or editing functions. The initial application of the variable field length data-processing unit is in the IBM Stretch computer.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1959.5219512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1959.5219512","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219502/05219512.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing Data in Bits and Pieces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1959","displayDocTitle":"Processing Data in Bits and Pieces","volume":"EC-8","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1959","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219512/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing Data in Bits and Pieces","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-8-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023435S","chronDate":"June  1959","isNumber":"5219502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5219512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219515,"authors":[{"name":"Harvey L.

The residue number system is of particular interest because the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication may be executed in the same period of time without the need for carry.

A discussion of the arithmetic operations and the conversion process required to convert from a residue code to a weighted code is given. It is concluded that in its present state the residue code is probably not suitable for general purpose computation but is suitable for a special class of control problems. Further research in both components and arithmetic is required if a residue code suitable for general purpose computation is to be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1959.5219515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1959.5219515","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219502/05219515.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Residue Number System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1959","displayDocTitle":"The Residue Number System","volume":"EC-8","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1959","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219515/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Residue Number System","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-8-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030986S","chronDate":"June  1959","isNumber":"5219502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"229","articleId":"5219515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219723,"authors":[{"name":"Bernard Cooper","affiliation":["ITT Federal Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Cooper","id":"37890429300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9235"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9340"}],"articleNumber":"5219723","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219723","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Terrestrial atmosphere","Apertures","Interference","Coherence","Optical collimators","Bandwidth","Electromagnetic scattering","Laser noise","Laboratories"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.1966.5219723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/5219697/05219723.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1966.5219723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical communications in the earth's atmosphere","abstract":"The main reasons for the present interest in the potentialities of the laser for communication system applications lie in the coherent nature of the radiation and the short wavelength.

An example of the logical design of a counter which advances by 13 is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1956.5219785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1956.5219785","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219779/05219785.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Odd Binary Asynchronous Counters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1956","displayDocTitle":"Odd Binary Asynchronous Counters","volume":"EC-5","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1956","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1956","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Odd Binary Asynchronous Counters","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-5-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027439S","chronDate":"March  1956","isNumber":"5219779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5219785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5219786,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This multiplier has the following advantages when compared to two other types of analog multipliers: a) an accuracy limited solely by the stability of the components used and the fineness of the adjustments that can be made; b) a pass band greater than that of servo-mechanism multipliers; c) a much smaller amount of material than is necessary for diode multipliers with translators having parabolic characteristics and adjustments which can be made much more rapidly (although requiring a certain amount of practice); d) the possibility of changing the diodes without having to repeat all the adjustments.

Considerations of diode uniformity requirements, stability problems and power supply requirements has led to a monostable type of logical circuit. The switching properties of this circuit are analyzed and found to depend upon the negative resistance-capacitance time constant of the unit. The basic function performed by the circuit is a thresholding operation from which a set of logical building blocks is derived. Compatible dynamic and bistable storage schemes are discussed. Of major importance is the effect of diode variations upon the logical gains and delays of the circuits. These properties have been tabulated for tunnel diodes with 5 per cent tolerances on knee current and voltage. Experimental circuits using diodes with a time constant of 1.4 nanoseconds have given a nominal switching time of 7.5 nanoseconds.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219874","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219874/05219881.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1960.5219881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1960.5219881","startPage":"430","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunnel Diode Logic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219881/","displayDocTitle":"Tunnel Diode Logic Circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-9","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunnel Diode Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-9-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017064S","chronDate":"Dec.  1960","isNumber":"5219874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5219881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5219884,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas J.

Basically, the current as a function of time is calculated by taking the gradient of the minority carrier charge stored in the base region. Two methods of approximating the distribution of stored charge are described. Good agreement has been obtained between calculated and experimental results; it is found that the rise time for the resistance-load case is about four times that for a capacitance-load case which produces the same peak current. A practical pulse generator circuit is described in which the resistance load takes the form of a delay-line. The performance of this circuit is compared with that of a capacitance-load relaxation oscillator; while the rise time of the former is longer, the pulse shape is more easily controlled.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1960.5219884","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219874/05219884.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1960.5219884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Build-Up in Avalanche Transistors with Resistance Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5219884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1960","displayDocTitle":"Current Build-Up in Avalanche Transistors with Resistance Loads","volume":"EC-9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1960","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Build-Up in Avalanche Transistors with Resistance Loads","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-9-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035997S","chronDate":"Dec.  1960","isNumber":"5219874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5219884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5219885,"authors":[{"name":"Forrest Salter","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Forrest","lastName":"Salter","id":"37313305100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-9950"}],"articleNumber":"5219885","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Transistorized Adder for a Digital Computer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5219885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Switches","Character generation","Digital arithmetic","Laboratories","Logic circuits","Electron tubes","Signal generators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEC.1960.5219885","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5219874/05219885.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1960.5219885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5219874","abstract":"An adder is described that has been developed for the Floating Indexed Point Arithmetic Unit, FLIP, to be used in conjunction with GEORGE, the existing computer built at Argonne National Laboratory.
