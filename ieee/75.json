Therefore, packaging and the specific layout of interconnects have a significant impact on the functional characteristics of a product. In order to prevent system problems, EMC/EMI concerns should be addressed at the design stage and not left as an afterthought. A full wave solution of the electromagnetic fields provide quantitative results for evaluation of signal integrity such as the current or voltage at specific points along the line. In addition, it also provides the electric and magnetic fields throughout. The structure that may lead to qualitative insights into the interactions between system components. Such insight may be an invaluable tool for solving EMC/EMI problems. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique is a full wave solver of the electromagnetic fields.

The board is populated with three wires where two of them extend outside of the board to represent off board coupling. This problem is solved using the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method which is a circuit based mixed potential integral equation (MPIE) solution technique. This technique is capable of solving heterogeneous circuits and fields problems in both the time and the frequency domains. We show that the time domain can be used to isolate some of the sources of radiation. Also, the example problem shows surprising results with respect to the coupling of signals on the printed circuit board.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE EMC Symposium.

Earlier modeling efforts used a variety of primary sources, such as an impressed current source, applied electric field, or a current on a wire. As experience has grown with FDTD modeling, it has been found that, because of the very nature of EMI/EMC modeling, the selection of the primary source, or excitation, is significant in ensuring a close resemblance between the numerical model and its physical correspondence. In this paper, the authors examine the different possible excitations and discuss their relevance to modeling, especially in light of the temporal excitation. It is hoped that this work provides insight to the limitations of various sources, and to help the modelers in achieving a stronger correspondence between the numerical simulation and actual physical behavior.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1998.750142","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE EMC Symposium.

As information about these voltages is necessary for the controller, all required voltage values are estimated from the measured line currents and the calculated values of the input reactor voltage during switching of the rectifier circuit. The input reactor voltage can be obtained by using a differentiator that produces the derivative of the line current or by detecting the voltage induced in a secondary winding wound on the input reactor. The secondary winding creates the electric isolation between the main circuit and the controller. The proposed method is verified by experiment. This paper describes the estimation method, gives the configuration of the controller, and discusses steady-state and transient performances of the rectifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6206633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Control of a three-phase PWM rectifier using estimated AC-side and DC-side voltages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of a three-phase PWM rectifier using estimated AC-side and DC-side voltages","sourcePdf":"00750174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048281S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"45","articleId":"750174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750178,"authors":[{"name":"Eun-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Power Electronics Division, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Kyungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Eun-Soo Kim","id":"37277102700"},{"name":"Kee-Yeon Joe","affiliation":["Power Electronics Division, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Kyungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kee-Yeon Joe","id":"37347602900"},{"name":"Moon-Ho Kye","affiliation":["Power Electronics Division, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Kyungnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moon-Ho Kye","id":"37301112200"},{"name":"Yoon-Ho Kim","lastName":"Yoon-Ho Kim","id":"37086969292"},{"name":"Byung-Do Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Do Yoon","id":"37345999600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"750178","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","DC-DC power converters","Leg","Topology","Snubbers","Inductors","Zero current switching","Zero voltage switching","Insulated gate bipolar transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","bridge circuits","DC-DC power convertors","losses","switching circuits","insulated gate bipolar transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-switching PWM FB DC/DC converter","conduction losses reduction","soft-switching topology","full-bridge converter","energy-recovery snubber","circulating current minimisation","tapped inductor","saturable reactor","RMS current stress reduction","zero-current switching","ZCS","zero-voltage switching","ZVS","reflected output current","left leg transition","insulated gate bipolar transistor","IGBT","7 kW","120 V","58 A","30 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750178","doi":"10.1109/63.750178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","abstract":"An improved soft-switching topology of a full-bridge (FB) pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) DC/DC converter is described.

The technique is based on a combination of the finite-element method (FEM) and the Polak-Ribiere nonlinear conjugate gradient optimization algorithm. The direct scattering problem is explicitly dealt with by means of the differential formulation and it is solved by applying the FEM. The inversion methodology is oriented to minimizing a cost function, which consists of a standard error term and regularization term. A sensitivity analysis, which is carried out by an elaborate finite-element procedure, results in the determination of the direction required for correcting the profile. Significant reduction of the computation time is obtained by introducing the adjoint state vector methodology. The efficiency of the presented inversion technique is validated by applying it to the inversion of synthetic scattered far-field measurements, which are corrupted by additive noise.","doi":"10.1109/22.750236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/16217/00750236.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.750236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse scattering using the finite-element method and a nonlinear optimization technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750236/","displayDocTitle":"Inverse scattering using the finite-element method and a nonlinear optimization technique","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6205897","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse scattering using the finite-element method and a nonlinear optimization technique","sourcePdf":"00750236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067765S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","articleId":"750236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750237,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Guoqiang Shen","id":"37360851700"},{"name":"Yinchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yinchao Chen","id":"37311250400"},{"name":"R.

In many of these systems, the products of parallel multipliers are rounded to avoid growth in word size. The power dissipation and area of rounded parallel multipliers can be significantly reduced by a technique known as truncated multiplication. With this technique, the least significant columns of the multiplication matrix are not used. Instead, the carries generated by these columns are estimated. This estimate is added with the most significant columns to produce the rounded product. This paper presents the design and implementation of parallel truncated multipliers.

As the device threshold voltage is reduced, it results in an exponential increase of leakage current in the subthreshold region. The leakage power is no longer negligible in such low voltage circuits. Estimates of maximum leakage power can be used in the design of the circuit to minimize the leakage power. The leakage power is dependent on the input vector. This input pattern dependence of the leakage power makes the problem of estimating the maximum leakage power a hard problem. In this paper, we present graph based algorithms for estimating the maximum leakage power. These algorithms are pattern-independent and do not require simulation of the circuit. Instead the circuit structure and the logic functionality of the components in the circuit are used to create a constraint graph. The problem of estimating the maximum leakage power is then transformed to an optimization problem on the constraint graph. Efficient algorithms on the graph are used to estimate the maximum leakage power dissipated by a circuit. We also present comparisons with exhaustive/long simulations for MCNC/ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits to verify the accuracy of the method.","doi":"10.1109/LPD.1999.750412","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Alessandro Volta Memorial Workshop on Low-Power Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Alessandro Volta Memorial Workshop on Low-Power Design","pdfPath":"/iel4/6066/16204/00750412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPD.1999.750412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16204","startPage":"116","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum leakage power estimation for CMOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum leakage power estimation for CMOS circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750412/","conferenceDate":"4-5 March 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6370325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum leakage power estimation for CMOS circuits","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"00750412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028008S","chronDate":"4-5 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6066","citationCount":"44","articleId":"750412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750432,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These extremely high stress conditions allow to determine the ruggedness of the device. This can be done by evaluating the maximum of avalanche energy which can be handled by the device submitted to the discharge of the unclamped inductive load. This analysis is performed by using a physically-based two-dimensional semiconductor device simulator associated with a circuit simulator which allows to apply boundary conditions. The simulation results, in good agreement with experiments, allow to investigate the dynamics of the IGBT. These results show that the static breakdown voltage value is not reached due to an excess of positive charges in the drift region. Furthermore, the dissipated energy is maximum under the Pbase region of the device, where the power density is the highest, as well as the temperature value.","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1999.750432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1999.750432","startPage":"664","endPage":"669 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"APEC '99.

Connectionless IP is more efficient for browsing, e-mail, and other non-real-time services; but for services demanding quality and real-time delivery, connection-oriented ATM is a much better candidate. Given the popularity of the Internet and the established status of ATM as the broadband transport standard, it is unlikely that one can replace the other. Therefore, the challenge we face lies in finding an efficient way to integrate the two. This article describes a research project reflecting this trend.

The proposed control scheme includes an active damping control, two feedforward controls and an online space vector control, which result in improved system stability and dynamic performance. The simulation results indicate that the proposed system has a superior voltage regulation in both transient and steady states. It is also demonstrated that the LC resonance between the output capacitor and the motor can be effectively suppressed through the proposed active damping control. All these improvements make the proposed CSI drive suitable for multi-motor applications. The proposed drive has the added advantage of having sinusoidal current and voltage waveforms. In addition, the drive can be implemented at high-power (1000-10,000 hp) levels due to the use of the CSI topology and low switching frequencies (typically 600 Hz).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A space vector modulated CSI-based AC drive for multi-motor applications","publicationTitle":"APEC '99.

Coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers have been shown to have desirable characteristics from a few hundreds of Hertz to a few Mega-Hertz and can be used for both power and signal transfer at low-power level. At low operating frequency, the magnetizing inductance has such low impedance that the driving power requirement could become excessive. This paper describes the use of coreless PCB transformer for isolated gate drive circuits over a wide frequency range. Based on a resonance concept, the optimal-operating condition that minimizes the power consumption of the gate drive circuits is developed and verified with experiments. Coreless PCB transformers do not require the manual winding procedure and thus simplifies the manufacturing process of transformer isolated gate drive circuits and low-power converters. Their sizes can be much smaller than those of typical core-based pulse transformers. The electrical isolation of PCB (typically from 15 kV to 40 kV) is much higher than that of an optocoupler (typically 2.5 kV).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750520/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6245718","conferenceDate":"14-18 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimal operation of coreless PCB transformer-isolated gate drive circuits with wide switching frequency range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal operation of coreless PCB transformer-isolated gate drive circuits with wide switching frequency range","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00750520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032299S","chronDate":"14-18 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059","citationCount":"1","articleId":"750520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":750529,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Yuan","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Electrometrology Laboratory, ETH-Zentrum / ETL, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"lastName":"Xiaoming Yuan","id":"37087180510"},{"name":"I.

Each RNN weight is encoded as a floating point number, and a concatenation of numbers forms a chromosome. Reproduction takes place locally in a square grid, each grid point representing a chromosome. Lamarckian and Baldwinian (1896) mechanisms for combining cellular GA and learning are compared. Different hill-climbing algorithms are incorporated into the cellular GA. These include the real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and its simplified versions, and the delta rule. RTRL has been successively simplified by freezing some of the weights to form simplified versions. The delta rule, the simplest form of learning, has been implemented by considering the RNN as feedforward networks. The hybrid algorithms are used to train the RNN to solve a long-term dependency problem. The results show that Baldwinian learning is inefficient in assisting the cellular GA. It is conjectured that the more difficult it is for genetic operations to produce the genotypic changes that match the phenotypic changes due to learning, the poorer is the convergence of Baldwinian learning. Most of the combinations using the Lamarckian mechanism show an improvement in reducing the number of generations for an optimum network; however, only a few can reduce the actual time taken. Embedding the delta rule in the cellular GA is the fastest method.

We propose a new gradient-based procedure called recursive backpropagation (RBP) whose online version, causal recursive backpropagation (CRBP), has some advantages over other online methods. CRBP includes as particular cases backpropagation (BP), temporal BP, Back-Tsoi algorithm (1991) among others, thereby providing a unifying view on gradient calculation for recurrent nets with local feedback. The only learning method known for locally recurrent nets with no architectural restriction is the one by Back and Tsoi. The proposed algorithm has better stability and faster convergence with respect to the Back-Tsoi algorithm. The computational complexity of the CRBP is comparable with that of the Back-Tsoi algorithm, e.g., less that a factor of 1.5 for usual architectures and parameter settings. The superior performance of the new algorithm, however, easily justifies this small increase in computational burden. In addition, the general paradigms of truncated BPTT and RTRL are applied to networks with local feedback and compared with CRBP. CRBP exhibits similar performances and the detailed analysis of complexity reveals that CRBP is much simpler and easier to implement, e.g., CRBP is local in space and in time while RTRL is not local in space.","doi":"10.1109/72.750549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750549.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"253","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line learning algorithms for locally recurrent neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"On-line learning algorithms for locally recurrent neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750549/","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6207451","pubMedId":"18252525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line learning algorithms for locally recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00750549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055328S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"120","articleId":"750549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":750552,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Eleven of the 100 electrodes were hard-wired to a percutaneous connector for chronic access. Prior to implant, cats were trained to \"lever-press\" in response to pure tone auditory stimulation. After implant, this behavior was transferred to \"lever-presses\" in response to current injections via single electrodes of the implanted arrays. Psychometric function curves relating injected charge level to the probability of response were obtained for stimulation of 22 separate electrodes in the 3 implanted cats. The average threshold charge/phase required for electrical stimulus detection in each cat was, 8.5, 8.6, and 11.6 nC/phase respectively, with a maximum charge/phase of 26 nC/phase and a minimum of 1.5 nC/phase thresholds were tracked for varying time intervals, and 7 electrodes from 2 cats were tracked for up to 100 days. Electrodes were stimulated for no more than a few minutes each day. Neural recordings taken from the same electrodes before and after multiple electrical stimulation sessions were very similar in signal/noise ratio and in the number of recordable units, suggesting that the range of electrical stimulation levels used did not damage neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes. Although a few early implants failed, the authors conclude that ICMS of cerebral cortex to evoke a behavioral response can be achieved with the penetrating UIEA. Further experiments in support of a sensory cortical prosthesis based on ICMS are warranted.","doi":"10.1109/86.750552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/16223/00750552.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.750552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chronic intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of cat sensory cortex using the Utah intracortical electrode array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Chronic intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of cat sensory cortex using the Utah intracortical electrode array","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6208014","pubMedId":"10188608","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chronic intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of cat sensory cortex using the Utah intracortical electrode array","sourcePdf":"00750552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089048S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"128","articleId":"750552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750553,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

This paper presents a method of designing neural nets where recurrent signal loops store knowledge in a manner analogous to short-term memory. The synaptic weights encode a learning algorithm. This gives these nets the ability to dynamically learn any functional mapping from a (possibly very large) set, without changing any synaptic weight. These nets are adaptive dynamic systems. Learning is online continually taking place as part of the net's overall behavior instead of a separate, externally driven process. We present four high-order fixed-weight learning nets. Two of these have standard backpropagation embedded in their synaptic weights. The other two utilize a more efficient gradient-descent-based rule. This scheme was discovered by examining variations in fixed-weight topology. We present empirical tests showing that all these nets could successfully learn functions from both discrete (Boolean) and continuous function sets. Largely, the networks were robust with respect to perturbations in the synaptic weights. The exception was the recurrent connections used to store information. These required a tight tolerance of 0.5%. The cost of these nets scaled approximately in proportion to the total number of synapses. We consider evolving fixed weight networks tailored to a specific problem class by analyzing the meta-learning cost surface of the networks presented.","doi":"10.1109/72.750553","startPage":"272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750553","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-weight on-line learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-weight on-line learning","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6207452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","pubMedId":"18252526","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-weight on-line learning","sourcePdf":"00750553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047304S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"24","articleId":"750553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":750555,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We investigate the knowledge induction process associated with training recurrent mural nets (RNN) on single long chaotic symbolic sequences. Even though training RNN to predict the next symbol leaves the standard performance measures such as the mean square error on the network output virtually unchanged, the nets extract a lot of knowledge. We monitor the knowledge extraction process by considering the nets stochastic sources and letting them generate sequences which are then confronted with the training sequence via information theoretic entropy and cross-entropy measures. We also study the possibility of reformulating the knowledge gained by RNN in a compact easy-to-analyze form of finite-state stochastic machines. The experiments are performed on two sequences with different complexities measured by the size and state transition structure of the induced Crutchfield's /spl epsiv/-machines (1991, 1994). The extracted machines can achieve comparable or even better entropy and cross-entropy performance. They reflect the training sequence complexity in their dynamical state representations that can be reformulated using finite-state means. The findings are confirmed by a much more detailed analysis of model generated sequences. We also introduce a visual representation of allowed block structure in the studied sequences that allows for an illustrative insight into both RNN training and finite-state stochastic machine extraction processes.","doi":"10.1109/72.750555","startPage":"284","endPage":"302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750555.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting finite-state representations from recurrent neural networks trained on chaotic symbolic sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Stochastic processes","Chaos","Data mining","Entropy","Measurement standards","Mean square error methods","Monitoring","Performance evaluation","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","knowledge acquisition","knowledge representation","time series","chaos","finite state machines","symbol manipulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-state representation extraction","recurrent neural networks","chaotic symbolic sequences","neural-based modeling","symbolic chaotic time series","knowledge induction process","RNN","mean square error","knowledge extraction","stochastic sources","information theoretic entropy measures","cross-entropy measures","finite-state stochastic machines","state transition structure","induced Crutchfield /spl epsiv/-machines","training sequence complexity","dynamical state representations","model generated sequences","visual representation","finite-state stochastic machine extraction processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Extracting finite-state representations from recurrent neural networks trained on chaotic symbolic sequences","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6207453","pubMedId":"18252527","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting finite-state representations from recurrent neural networks trained on chaotic symbolic sequences","sourcePdf":"00750555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067913S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"25","articleId":"750555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":750559,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Z.

The process operation is partitioned into several fuzzy operating regions. Within each region, a local linear model is used to model the process. The global model output is obtained through the centre of gravity defuzzification which is essentially the interpolation of local model outputs. This modeling strategy utilizes both process knowledge and process input/output data. Process knowledge is used to initially divide the process operation into several fuzzy operating regions and to set up the initial fuzzification layer weights. Process I/O data are used to train the network. Network weights are such trained so that the long-term prediction errors are minimized. Through training, membership functions of fuzzy operating regions are refined and local models are learnt. Based on the recurrent neuro-fuzzy network model, a novel type of nonlinear model-based long range predictive controller can be developed and it consists of several local linear model-based predictive controllers. Local controllers are constructed based on the corresponding local linear models and their outputs are combined to form a global control action by using their membership functions. This control strategy has the advantage that control actions can be calculated analytically avoiding the time consuming nonlinear programming procedures required in conventional nonlinear model-based predictive control. The techniques have been successfully applied to the modeling and control of a neutralization process.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750562.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.750562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent neuro-fuzzy networks for nonlinear process modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Predictive models","Fuzzy sets","Gravity","Interpolation","Predictive control","Neural networks","Function approximation","Chemical analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modelling","nonlinear systems","fuzzy neural nets","recurrent neural nets","interpolation","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","errors","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neuro-fuzzy networks","nonlinear process modeling","long-term prediction models","fuzzy operating regions","local linear model","centre-of-gravity defuzzification","local model output interpolation","process knowledge","process input/output data","process I/O data","fuzzification layer weights","long-term prediction error minimization","membership functions","recurrent neuro-fuzzy network model","nonlinear model-based long-range predictive controller","local linear model-based predictive controllers","neutralization process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent neuro-fuzzy networks for nonlinear process modeling","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6207455","pubMedId":"18252529","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent neuro-fuzzy networks for nonlinear process modeling","sourcePdf":"00750562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044923S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"215","articleId":"750562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":750563,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The Volterra systems constitute a very broad class of stable nonlinear dynamic systems that can be extended to cover nonstationary (time-varying) cases. This novel architecture is composed of parallel subnets of three-layer perceptrons with polynomial activation functions, with the output of each subnet modulated by an appropriate time function that gives the summative output its time-varying characteristics. The paper shows the equivalence between this network architecture and the class of time-varying Volterra systems, and demonstrates the range of applicability of this approach with computer-simulated examples and real data. Although certain types of nonstationarities may not be amenable to this approach, it is hoped that this methodology will provide the practical tools for modeling some broad classes of nonlinear, nonstationary systems from input-output data, thus advancing the state of the art in a problem area that is widely viewed as a daunting challenge.","doi":"10.1109/72.750563","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750563.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"339","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of nonlinear nonstationary dynamic systems with a novel class of artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of nonlinear nonstationary dynamic systems with a novel class of artificial neural networks","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6207456","pubMedId":"18252530","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of nonlinear nonstationary dynamic systems with a novel class of artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00750563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024289S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"32","articleId":"750563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":750564,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Brdys","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Brdys","id":"37332088000"},{"name":"G.J.

This case study represents one of the more difficult control problems due to the complex, nonlinear, and time-varying dynamics of the motor and unavailability of full-state measurements. A partial solution is first presented based on a single input-single output (SISO) algorithm employing static multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. A novel technique is subsequently described which is based on a recurrent neural network employed as a dynamical model of the plant. Recent stability results for this algorithm are reported. The technique is applied to multiinput-multioutput (MIMO) control of the motor. A simulation study of both methods is presented. It is argued that appropriately structured recurrent neural networks can provide conveniently parameterized dynamic models for many nonlinear systems for use in adaptive control.","doi":"10.1109/72.750564","startPage":"340","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750564.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic neural controllers for induction motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Programmable control","Multilayer perceptrons","Recurrent neural networks","Stability","MIMO","Rotors","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","neurocontrollers","machine control","nonlinear control systems","adaptive control","large-scale systems","time-varying systems","multilayer perceptrons","recurrent neural nets","stability","MIMO systems","multivariable control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic neural controllers","adaptive control","neural networks","induction motor control","complex nonlinear time-varying dynamics","SISO algorithm","static multilayer perceptron networks","MLP networks","stability results","MIMO control","recurrent neural networks","nonlinear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural controllers for induction motor","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6207457","pubMedId":"18252531","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural controllers for induction motor","sourcePdf":"00750564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048443S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"88","articleId":"750564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750566,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

However, few practical implementations of nonlinear active controllers have been realized. Nonlinear active controllers may be required in cases where the actuators used in active control systems exhibit nonlinear characteristics, or in cases when the structure to be controlled exhibits a nonlinear behavior. A multilayer perceptron neural-network based control structure was previously introduced as a nonlinear active controller, with a training algorithm based on an extended backpropagation scheme. This paper introduces new heuristical training algorithms for the same neural-network control structure. The objective is to develop new algorithms with faster convergence speed and/or lower computational loads. Experimental results of active sound control using a nonlinear actuator with linear and nonlinear controllers are presented. The results show that some of the new algorithms can greatly improve the learning rate of the neural-network control structure, and that for the considered experimental setup a neural-network controller can outperform linear controllers.","doi":"10.1109/72.750568","startPage":"391","endPage":"401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.750568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16222","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/16222/00750568.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved training of neural networks for the nonlinear active control of sound and vibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750568/","displayDocTitle":"Improved training of neural networks for the nonlinear active control of sound and vibration","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6207461","pubMedId":"18252535","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved training of neural networks for the nonlinear active control of sound and vibration","sourcePdf":"00750568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042022S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"109","articleId":"750568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":750569,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

If an application's I/O needs are met by making many small, distinct I/O requests, however, the I/O performance degrades drastically. To avoid this problem, MPI-IO allows users to access a noncontiguous data set with a single I/O function call. This feature provides MPI-IO implementations an opportunity to optimize data access. We describe how our MPI-IO implementation, ROMIO, delivers high performance in the presence of noncontiguous requests. We explain in detail the two key optimizations ROMIO performs: data sieving for noncontiguous requests from one process and collective I/O for noncontiguous requests from multiple processes. We describe how one can implement these optimizations portably on multiple machines and file systems, control their memory requirements, and also achieve high performance. We demonstrate the performance and portability with performance results for three applications-an astrophysics-application template (DIST3D) the NAS BTIO benchmark, and an unstructured code (UNSTRUC)-on five different parallel machines: HP Exemplar IBM SP, Intel Paragon, NEC SX-4, and SGI Origin2000.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16195","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In this work, the nominal target densities were 350 Kbpi/spl times/34 Ktpi. To make these densities possible, large signal-to-noise gains were attained with the use of high performance spin-valve read heads and low noise thin film media. At the same time, very narrow track write heads were designed and fabricated by extending conventional photolithographic techniques. Finally, small magnetic spacings between the head and the disk were attained with low flying ABS designs and improved head and disk surfaces. Recording tests showed satisfactory writability and large readback signal of around 2 mV//spl mu/m. The 50% rolloff densities were as high as 10 Kfc/mm, while the write and read trackwidths were as narrow as 0.7 and 0.5 /spl mu/m respectively. An overall assessment of the parametric recording results indicated an areal density capability of at least 10 Gb/in/sup 2/. This projection was confirmed by error rate testing with an EPR-4 channel, where very low ontrack errors of 10/sup -10//spl sim/10/sup -9/ were achieved at 315/spl sim/380 Kbpi. Furthermore, squeeze measurements revealed well-defined 747 behavior with offtrack maxima at 0.7/spl sim/0.8 /spl mu/m trackpitch. The product of linear and track densities for the write and read head combinations tested indeed showed that an areal density of 11/spl sim/12 Gb/in/sup 2/ has been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/20.750629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/16224/00750629.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.750629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"12 Gb/in/sup 2/ recording demonstration with SV read heads and conventional narrow pole-tip write heads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"12 Gb/in/sup 2/ recording demonstration with SV read heads and conventional narrow pole-tip write heads","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6198612","volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"12 Gb/in/sup 2/ recording demonstration with SV read heads and conventional narrow pole-tip write heads","sourcePdf":"00750629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064746S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"31","articleId":"750629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750639,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Hua Zeng","affiliation":["Computer Mechanics Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qing-Hua Zeng","id":"37363849400"},{"name":"D.B.

Most current sliders are designed for contact-start-stop, and are not suitable for L/UL. In this paper, a previously introduced L/UL model for numerical simulation is improved. Four basic designs of air bearing surfaces with sub-ambient pressure cavities are presented, and their L/UL processes are simulated. We find that the ABS design significantly affects the L/UL performance. Two designs show very good unload performance, and the other two do not. We introduce a new slider, which meets all design and fabrication requirements, that has been designed specifically for L/UL. Further ways to improve its load performance are also discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical simulation","Cascading style sheets","Laboratories","Disk drives","Optical recording","Computer aided manufacturing","Contamination","Rails","Application software","Portable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard discs","disc drives","stiction","sliding friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slider air bearing designs","load/unload applications","disk wear","stiction","sub-ambient pressure cavities","unload performance","load performance","disk drives","hard disks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750639","doi":"10.1109/20.750639","startPage":"746","endPage":"751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/16224/00750639.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.750639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750639/","displayDocTitle":"Slider air bearing designs for load/unload applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6198622","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slider air bearing designs for load/unload applications","sourcePdf":"00750639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043469S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"25","articleId":"750639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":750644,"authors":[{"name":"Nan-Hsiung Yeh","affiliation":["Komag, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Nan-Hsiung Yeh","id":"37087182243"},{"name":"D.

Since the noise of thin film media is recording-wavelength-dependent, a pseudo-random sequence (PRS) pattern is proposed for the characterization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This allows for a fair comparison of the media and head noise at the Viterbi decoder input. Extracted di-pulse response measurements indicate that the nonlinear distortion (NLD) at high recording density is not necessarily dominated by partial erasure of the media. Magnetoresistive (MR) read head distortion and write head flux rise time may play a significant role. A method to estimate the bit error rate (BER) from component level SNR and NLD measurement is described. Contributions of head noise, electronic noise, media noise and NLD to the root mean square (RMS) error and BER for today's typical disk drives are analyzed. With the advancement of head and media development, future head requirements to achieve media-noise-limited recording are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/20.750644","startPage":"776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/16224/00750644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.750644","endPage":"781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal head design and characterization from a media perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/750644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Optimal head design and characterization from a media perspective","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6198627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal head design and characterization from a media perspective","sourcePdf":"00750644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023442S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"27","articleId":"750644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":750656,"authors":[{"name":"M.

While channel-induced intersymbol interference can be eliminated by dividing the data stream into parallel bit sequences in OFDM communications, the loss of orthogonality due to the carrier frequency offset must be compensated before DFT-based demodulation can be performed. A new solution to the carrier offset estimation problem was developed without using reference symbols. The technique provides a high accuracy carrier estimate by taking advantage of the inherent orthogonality among OFDM subchannels. The authors show that this algorithm can be used to perform offset estimation and compensation in a practical system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

We consider the channel equalization for the OFDM system that achieves one hundred percent efficiency of bandwidth usage at the cost of equalizing an ICI and ISI channel. A one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed.

This is achieved by combining such technologies as reconfigurable or adaptive computing and CORDIC style arithmetic, for computing (possibly hyperbolic) rotations, multiply, divide, and related higher order functions (e.g. square-root, multidimensional rotations). Reconfiguration allows adapting the implementation of such functions to the specific needs of individual or specific sets of applications, from multimedia to radar and sonar, hence creating application specific CORDIC-style implementations. We show a high-throughput CORDIC for reconfigurable computing, a low latency CORDIC, and discuss an application to adaptive filtering (normalized ladder algorithm).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Delay","Algorithm design and analysis","Parallel processing","Pipeline processing","Arithmetic","Multidimensional systems","Radar applications","Sonar applications","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","parallel architectures","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable CORDIC architectures","very high performance architectures","data intensive applications","latency tolerant applications","parallelism","pipelining","algorithm","bit level","adaptive computing","CORDIC style arithmetic","hyperbolic rotations","multiplication","division","higher order functions","square-root","multidimensional rotations","multimedia","radar","sonar","high-throughput CORDIC","reconfigurable computing","low latency CORDIC","adaptive filtering","normalized ladder algorithm","object-oriented hardware design environment","ASIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=750850","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.750850","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The reasons for the significant gap between achievable MAC bandwidth and that delivered by current embedded DSP architectures are analyzed in detail. A processing engine composed of a general purpose DSP core closely coupled with an application-specific version of Renaissance-our previously developed vector co-processor with a residue arithmetic datapath-is proposed as a solution to close this gap. In the first step, code transformations are applied to firmware to expose the vector-like nature of DSP computation. Then, Renaissance's instruction set, datapath and control are personalized for vector primitives thus exposed. The most important advantages of this approach are that it is highly amenable to automation, it captures most of the compute intensive routines (>70%) quite well and makes the Renaissance reusable across applications. This paradigm has resulted in throughput gains ranging from 33% to over 200% when firmware for actual communications and speech coding applications was recoded. In Ren-AC, a Renaissance version optimized for a modem bank application, the system-wide increase in MAC throughput was higher than 50%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Renaissance-a residue number system based vector co-processor for DSP dominated embedded ASICs","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Traditionally, Fourier transforms were utilized in determining the frequency spectrum of the typically non-stationary EMG signals. The continuous wavelet transform, suggested in this paper, is more appropriate. In this study, signals from four muscles of the right lower extremity were recorded, for eight normal subjects, during steady-state gait. The time-frequency distributions of these signals were computed using the fourth order Daubechies mother wavelet.

The presence of ISI leads to significant mismatch between the the received signature vector and the transmitted code. Adaptive detectors designed for AWGN channels yield unacceptable performance due to this mismatch, unless equipped with a channel estimator. Previously, some methods that bypass explicit channel estimation have been proposed-these are shown to perform inadequately in general. This paper develops a channel estimation based blind adaptive detector that utilizes an efficient subspace tracker. The proposed scheme out-performs some of the existing methods (notably those without channel estimation) at the expense of modest increase in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.750920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16210","startPage":"533","endPage":"537 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel4/6069/16210/00750920.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Applications include the following: (a) equalization for single user systems in fast fading (b) adaptive multiuser detection, or interference suppression, for direct sequence CDMA systems employing short spreading sequences in fast fading; (c) blind beamforming using a receive antenna array for direct sequence CDMA systems with long spreading sequences. Note that standard MMSE adaptation either fails in fast fading environments such as (a) and (b), or incurs significant overhead in terms of pilot symbols for tracking the fades.

Training based approaches to this problem may require synchronization among users and often need a large number of training symbols. On the other hand, most blind channel estimation methods are restricted to the case that the multi-user channel is invertible, i.e., each user's signal and can be recovered in the absence of noise. A new semi-blind equalization algorithm is proposed based on least squares smoothing techniques that simultaneously reduce the number of interfering signals and the amount of intersymbol interference for the signal-of-interest. As a result, the proposed approach requires considerably less number of known symbols for equalization. Further, it also removes-to a large degree-the requirement of the existence of channel inverse for interfering users.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.750942","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Periodic orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard sequences spread different users' symbols followed by scrambling by a symbol aperiodic base-station specific overlay sequence. This corresponds to the downlink of the European UMTS wideband CDMA proposal. The point to point propagation channel from the cell-site to a certain mobile station is the same for all downlink signals (desired user as well as the interference). The composite channel is shorter than a symbol period for some user signals, while other users can have significant ISI owing to a faster transmission rate. In any case, orthogonality of the underlying Walsh-Hadamard sequences is destroyed by multipath propagation, resulting in multiuser interference if a coherent combiner (the RAKE receiver) is employed. We propose linear zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) receivers which equalize for the estimated channel, thus rendering the user signals orthogonal again. A simple code matched filter subsequently suffices to cancel the multiple access interference (MAI) from intracell users.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.750943","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

A recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is developed that approximately computes the joint maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the delays and user amplitudes. It is shown that the optimal decorrelator and demodulated symbols are also generated by the RLS algorithm.

This paper extends this work by considering the tracking behavior of analog output neurons when subjected to additive noise and slowly drifting target weights. The target weights are described by a stochastic difference equation with weights changing slowly with time. The tracker weights follow the least mean square (LMS) gradient descent algorithm and at each update are given a noise corrupted value of the output of the target network. When inputs are Gaussian and the activation used is the Gaussian error function (closely approximates the standard sigmoidal activation function) the analysis is tractable. The dynamics of target and tracking networks are described by a set of stochastic difference equations. We obtain an approximation of the mean squared generalization error by linearizing the nonlinear difference equations and using simple probabilistic arguments. We consider the single neuron case and some specific multi-layer neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.750949","pdfPath":"/iel4/6069/16210/00750949.pdf","startPage":"683","endPage":"684 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

An adaptive power control algorithm is exploited to achieve the desired signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) at each subchannel and increase the power efficiency of the mobile transmitter. At the receiver side, the base station uses an antenna array to optimize the SNR-power efficiency, and attenuate the interference from other users dramatically. Therefore, we can achieve a better overall error probability with a fixed total power. A distributed iterative algorithm is used to jointly update the transmission power and the beamformer weights at each subchannel so that it can converge to the optimal solution for both power and beamforming vectors at each subchannel. The algorithm uses only the interference measured locally by the transmitter. Unlike most of the loading algorithms which optimize the bit distribution and subchannel power allocation for a single transmitter this approach tries to optimize the power allocation and decrease the interference for the whole network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming and power allocation for OFDM over wireless networks","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

This method is predicated on the fact that the FRFT perfectly localizes a linear FM signal as an impulse when the angle parameter of the transform matches the sweep rate (chirp rate) of the linear chirp signal. Therefore, a transform domain thresholding can often eliminate linear-FM type interferences without severely affecting the desired part of the received signal. Thus we propose a preprocessing of the received signal by an FRFT-based excision scheme prior to demodulation. The simulations demonstrate that this technique often improves the bit error performance of the receiver when compared to the case where there is no preprocessing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband interference excision in spread spectrum communication systems via fractional Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

In the context of motion-compensated DCT-based coding of video as in MPEG video, this problem of DCT domain inverse motion compensation has been studied by Chang and Messerschmitt (1995) and fast algorithm based on factorization of the DCT matrix is proposed by Merhav and Bhaskaran (see IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Conference Proceedings, vol.4, p.2307-10, 1996). These schemes, however, treat each 8/spl times/8 block as a fundamental unit, and do not take into account the fact that in MPEG, a macrolock consists of several such blocks. In this paper, we show how shared information within a macroblock such as motion vector and common blocks can be exploited to yield substantial speedup in computation. Compared to the brute-force approach of Chang et al., our algorithms yield about a 44% improvement. Our technique is independent of the underlying computational or processor model, and thus can be implemented on top of any optimized solution. We demonstrate an improvement by about 19% and 13.5% in the worst case on top of the optimized solutions presented by Merhav and Bhaskaran and by Assuncao and Ghanbari (see ICASSP 1997, p.2633-36, 1997).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast DCT domain inverse motion compensation algorithm based on shared information in a macroblock","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The technique eliminates the need for computing eigenvalues or matrix exponentials as well as solving bilateral matrix equations, and thereby leads to a numerically efficient algorithm. The noise sources considered here are the ON-resistances of MOS switches and the input referred noise PSD's of operational amplifiers (opamps).

Stabilizing formulations of the method normally rely on the assumption that global and exact solutions of nonconvex, nonlinear optimization problems are possible in limited computational time. In the paper, we first establish conditions under which suboptimal model predictive control (MPC) controllers are stabilizing; the conditions are mild holding out the hope that many existing controllers remain stabilizing even if optimality is lost. Second, we present and analyze two suboptimal MPC schemes that are guaranteed to be stabilizing, provided an initial feasible solution is available and for which the computational requirements are more reasonable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Stability","Testing","Optimal control","Control systems","Costs","Nonlinear systems","Optimization methods","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive control","nonlinear control systems","stability","suboptimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal model predictive control","exact solutions","global solutions","stabilizing control","nonlinear systems","nonlinear optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.751369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/16228/00751369.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.751369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suboptimal model predictive control (feasibility implies stability)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=751369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Suboptimal model predictive control (feasibility implies stability)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/751369/","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6205891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suboptimal model predictive control (feasibility implies stability)","sourcePdf":"00751369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022625S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"393","articleId":"751369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":751410,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The goal of this research has been to identify the most efficient multiprocessor utilization for a prototypical beamformer by modeling the signal processing and applying selected multiprocessor scheduling algorithms. A synchronous dataflow (SDF) domain model was used to implement the most computationally intense core of the beamformer in Ptolemy. In order to evaluate multiprocessor scheduling performance, four automated scheduling strategies were applied: declustering, a classical list scheduler, dynamic-level scheduler, and a hierarchical scheduler. A manual heuristic schedule was also postulated and evaluated. Several key metrics were applied in judging optimality. It is demonstrated that the hierarchical scheduler holds measurable advantage over the other algorithms considered including the manual method. An analysis of the underlying performance drivers is given.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751412","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

This input consists of a single data value every clock cycle. While this can be efficient for 1-D applications, 2-D ones, such as image processing, suffer from the dimensional direction bottleneck of the separable 2-D filter. The block-based architectures greatly reduce these on-chip memory requirements. Though the block-based architectures may take more computation time, the work can be divided among several processors. This paper demonstrates how a block processing architecture can be achieved, with advantages for the 2-dimensional DWT; less memory and parallel computation. Though the 2-D DWT in particular is discussed, these ideas apply to multi-dimensional cases as well.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751417","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Unlike at the receiver exploiting the diversity advantage from multiple transmitting antennas is difficult since channel knowledge is not readily available at the transmitter and because the signals arrive having been combined in space. To alleviate this problem we propose a simple scheme called partial phase combining (PPC) which uses partial knowledge about the relative phases of the channels to select the antenna phases. The proposed algorithm is useful in systems where the channel is correlated from frame to frame.

The receiver consists of an antenna array, which operates as a weight-and-sum beamformer, followed by an adaptive matrix equalizer. The proposed algorithm uses the synchronization sequences provided in a TDMA system to compute the beamformer weights and to generate estimates of the multipath channels between the cochannel sources and the base station. The multipath channel estimates are used to modify the beamformer weights. The adaptive equalizer compensates for Rayleigh fading by continually tracking the multipath channel. Thus, channel estimation and adaptive beamforming are simultaneously used to compensate for Rayleigh fading and cochannel interference. The performance of the adaptive system is illustrated for cochannel IS-136 signals.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751431","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Unlike the principal-components method for reduced-rank filtering this method performs well when the subspace spanned by the filter is less than the dimension of the signal subspace. We present block and recursive algorithms for estimating the filter parameters, which do not require matrix inversion or an eigen-decomposition The algorithm performance in the context of a heavily loaded DS-CDMA system is characterized via computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

For the DFE equalizer, the feed-forward filter is sample-spaced while the feedback filter is symbol-spaced. This is in contrast to conventional equalization which employs symbol-spaced taps encompassing roughly the duration of the pulse symbol waveform, which is on the order of 10T when the excess bandwidth parameter is less than 0.35, for example. The comparative BER performance of the multichannel zero forcing, MMSE, and DFE equalizers using sample-spaced taps is presented for both a time-invariant channel and a case where the channels vary substantially over the burst due to the mobile motion. In the latter case, the new sample-spaced zero-forcing equalizer is shown to dramatically outperform the MMSE and DFE equalizers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Delay effects","Receiving antennas","Antenna feeds","Filters","Baseband","Feedforward systems","Output feedback","Bandwidth","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","decision feedback equalisers","signal sampling","parameter estimation","land mobile radio","telecommunication channels","feedforward","radiofrequency filters","filtering theory","receiving antennas","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE equalizer","DFE equalizer","oversampling","multiple receiver antennas","multichannel equalizer structures","decision-directed updates","initial channel estimates","short training sequence processing","delay spread","symbol rate","spatially separated antennas","receiver","baseband antenna output","sample-spaced taps","sample-spaced feed-forward filter","symbol-spaced feedback filter","pulse symbol waveform duration","excess bandwidth parameter","BER performance","time-invariant channel","sample-spaced zero-forcing equalizer"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751434","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1116 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Identification of the linear subsystems relies on the output second order cyclostationary/stationary statistics, induced in the transmit data by non-redundant periodically time-varying and/or redundant block precoders. It is shown that identification of linear subsystems is robust to channel order overestimation errors, location of channel zeros, and color of additive noise.

It is therefore critical to provide sound security mechanisms for multicast communication. Yet, existing security protocols for multicast offer only partial solutions. We first present a taxonomy of multicast scenarios on the Internet and point out relevant security concerns. Next we address two major security problems of multicast communication: source authentication, and key revocation. Maintaining authenticity in multicast protocols is a much more complex problem than for unicast; in particular, known solutions are prohibitively inefficient in many cases. We present a solution that is reasonable for a range of scenarios. This approach can be regarded as a 'midpoint' between traditional message authentication codes and digital signatures.

This paper presents an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem of minimizing the total wavelength mileage (/spl lambda/-miles) required to support a set of given traffic demands in a given network topology using SHR/WDM employing 1:N line protection mechanism (the WRL problem). This formulation allows to jointly and optimally solve the three subproblems, and yields up to 15% reduction of the total /spl lambda/-miles required by existing solutions that separately resolve the sub-problems. A simplified sub-optimal solution of the WRL problem is also provided, that yields results few percent worse than the optimal solution and that is tractable for networks whose size is on the order of the pan-European network, i.e., 19 nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/751459/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6337958","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"21-25 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Survivable networks based on optimal routing and WDM self-healing rings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survivable networks based on optimal routing and WDM self-healing rings","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00751459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0282S","chronDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6063","citationCount":"38","articleId":"751459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":751461,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In such and other networks, the failure of a network element (e.g., fiber link, cross-connect, etc.) may cause the failure of several optical channels, thereby leading to large data losses. This study examines different approaches to protect mesh based WDM optical networks from single-link failures. These approaches are based on two basic survivability paradigms: (a) path protection/restoration, and (b) link protection/restoration. In path- and link-protection schemes, backup paths and wavelengths are reserved in advance at the time of call setup. Path- and link-restoration schemes are dynamic schemes in which backup paths are discovered (from the spare capacity in the network) upon the occurrence of a failure. In part 1 of this study presented in this paper, we formulated integer linear programs to determine the capacity requirements for the above protection schemes for a static traffic demand.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survivable WDM mesh networks.

The goal of the allocation scheme is to provide a good application-layer service to a wide diversity of applications sharing available bandwidth. We achieve this goal while also supporting changes in utility over time, tolerating some inaccuracy in utility function specification, and addressing the issue of circumvention through pricing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Our basic idea is to reduce intercellular interference and improve the capture probability by coordinating transmission powers of users in different cells. This coordination is determined beforehand and no real-time coordination is required. Power control is static and fixed. We formulate and solve a generic optimal scheduling problem with our coordination scheme. We find that the optimal scheduling policy is in a simple form of bang-bang control, which is illustrated for a specific case with the uniform fairness constraint. We evaluate, via numerical analysis and simulation, both throughput and delay, and compare them with other schemes. We find that the coordination scheme can achieve significant performance improvement, in terms of both maximum throughput and throughput-delay tradeoff, over a wide range of capture ratio values.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.751483","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

While there have been considerable efforts to study CDMA systems at both the physical layer and network layer, the network capacity of power-controlled CDMA systems with linear receivers, especially in fading environments, is not well-understood. In this paper, we study a single-cell synchronous CDMA system equipped with the matched filter receiver in fading channels, and identify the network capacity for single-class systems and the network capacity region for multiple-class systems assuming known distributions of received powers of mobile users. Both the network capacity and network capacity region can be uniquely expressed in terms of the users QoS requirements and the distributions of the received powers. We also find the tightest upper bound of the network capacity over all possible distributions of received powers, and explore the concepts of effective target SIR and effective bandwidth, which play an important role in determining the admissibility and characterizing the network capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

By observing the temporal correlation of cochannel interference when transmitters can send data contiguously, a Kalman filter is used to predict interference power in the future. Based on the predicted interference and estimated path gain between the transmitter and receiver, the transmission power is determined to achieve a desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Performance results reveal that the Kalman-filter method for power control provides a significant performance improvement. Specifically, when a message consists of 10 packets on average, the 90 and 95 percentile of the SINR by the new method are 3.94 and 5.53 dB above those when no power control is in use, and lie just 0.73 and 1.04 dB below the upper-bound performance of the optimal power control, respectively, in a system with 4-sector cells and an interleaved frequency assignment of a reuse factor of 2/8. As a by-product, these results show that the cell layout and assignment scheme combined with the new method for power control can be used to support high-speed data services.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.751485","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

In these networks, satellite links are used for interconnecting remote network segments as well as for providing direct network access to homes and businesses. In this environment, the satellite network must support not only circuit switched traffic, but also packet services with highly bursty traffic patterns. The traditional circuit switched approach based on the user or network signaling is inadequate to carry dynamically varying packet traffic efficiently, necessitating faster bandwidth allocation solutions. Standard interworking solutions and air interfaces are very important for interoperability leading to proliferation of satellite networks to potentially millions of home and business users. In this article we provide an overview of the standardization effort that has started at the TIA in the area of satellite ATM networks.

MAC protocols are designed to coordinate the transmission of packets, retransmission of damaged packets, and resolution of collisions among stations during a contention period. MAC protocols are foundations in low-level network architecture and play a significant role in the performance of higher-level protocols such as multiservices and multimedia application protocols. In this article five classes of MAC protocols are investigated with respect to their applications in satellite communications. These classes include fixed assignments, demand assignment, random access, hybrid random access and reservation, and adaptive protocols. Among several QoS objectives described in high-speed networking and the limitations inherent in satellite communications systems, in this article a set of important performance criteria are identified and used to evaluate different MAC protocols for satellite communications. The performance criteria include high channel throughput, low transmission delay, channel stability, protocol scalability, channel reconfigurability, broadband applicability, and low complexity of the control algorithm. For this, a simulation study is performed among selected MAC protocols from different classes, and their performances have been evaluated for NASA's Mars Regional Network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/751497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6206007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Medium access control protocols performance in satellite communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium access control protocols performance in satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00751497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039149S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"83","articleId":"751497","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":751505,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The project which is investigating a novel packet-based optical WDM transport network-involves determining the management, systems, and devices ramifications of a new network control scheme, SCWP, which is flexible and simplifies optical hardware requirements. The principal objective of the project is to understand the advantages and potential of optical packet switching compared to the conventional electronic approach. Several schemes for packet header implementation are described, using subcarrier multiplexing, separate wave lengths, and serial transmission. A novel node design is introduced, based on wavelength router devices, which reduce loss, hence reducing booster amplifier gain and concomitant ASE noise. The fabrication of these devices, and also wavelength converters, are described. A photonic packet switching testbed is detailed which will allow the ideas developed within WASPNET to be tested in practice, permitting the practical problems of their implementation to be determined.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=751509","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packet switching","Optical packet switching","Educational institutions","Optical devices","Optical fiber networks","WDM networks","Testing","Collaboration","Electrical equipment industry","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","subcarrier multiplexing","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network management","telecommunication control","wavelength division multiplexing","photonic switching systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WASPNET","wavelength switched packet network","University of Strathclyde","Essex University","Bristol University","packet-based optical WDM transport network","management","network control scheme","SCWP","optical packet switching","packet header implementation","subcarrier multiplexing","serial transmission","node design","wavelength router devices","loss","booster amplifier gain","ASE noise","fabrication","wavelength converters","photonic packet switching testbed","implementation"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/16231/00751509.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.751509","doi":"10.1109/35.751509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WASPNET: a wavelength switched packet network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/751509/","displayDocTitle":"WASPNET: a wavelength switched packet network","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6206016","volume":"37","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WASPNET: a wavelength switched packet network","sourcePdf":"00751509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053116S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"147","articleId":"751509","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":751513,"authors":[{"name":"S.

(1974) examined the output SNR of an adaptive beamformer, or coherent adaptive matched filter (Chen and Reed 1991, Robey et al. 1992), conditioned on the sample covariance matrix. This output SNR varies with different realizations of the sample covariance. When normalized by the known-covariance SNR, it is a beta random variable. Its closeness to unity is an indicator of how close the performance of the AMF approaches that of the non-adaptive matched filter. In this paper we examine the SNR, not conditioned on the sample covariance, as a figure-of-merit for detection performance. We find an additional criterion for performance convergence that is not obtained from the conditional SNR analysis. For our analysis, we make use of our method of \"stochastic representations,\" first presented in Kraut et al.

Previously, a dependence graph (DG) of the DWT has been presented which enables systolic mapping techniques to be used to derive DWT architectures. We use this DG to systematically derive new DWT architectures. In addition, we present a DG for the IDWT and use it to systematically derive new IDWT architectures. The resulting DWT and IDWT architectures are scalable with filter length and number of octaves, modular, have high hardware utilization, and use fixed-coefficient multipliers. These properties make them well-suited for VLSI implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic VLSI architectures for 1-D discrete wavelet transforms","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751521","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1224 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16211","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Vast power differences between nearby jammers and distant satellite sources makes the spread-spectrum gain of the GPS signal inadequate for anti-jamming (A/J) protection. Adaptive antenna nulling systems have been proposed for additional A/J protection, but current systems, such as the AE-1, fail to address the near-field multipath associated with arrays mounted on a real aircraft. We examine the design of a space-time-adaptive (STAP) beamformer for GPS nulling, including the effects the STAP processor has on the GPS position calculation via the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements from different satellites. Two novel architectures are proposed, and their performance quantified via a simulation driven by measurements taken on a 1/4 scale F-16.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16211","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1336 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel4/6069/16211/00751542.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

This assumption typically holds in TDD based mobile communication systems. We consider the SDMA strategy for using antenna arrays to gain system capacity. In that case the number of interfering users located in the same cell, namely d, can be higher than the spreading factor. The goal is to design FIR transmission filters at the base station in order to maximize the minimum matched filter bound among the d users. Several approaches, namely the zero-forcing, linear minimum mean square error, minimum output energy and the pre-RAKE are considered to solve the problem.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751543","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The identification criteria incorporate the temporal and spatial characteristics of the transients.

We derive a closed-form expression for the large-sample Cramer-Rao bound and show that it depends upon an average SNR defined in the frequency domain (as opposed to the time-domain averaged SNR, i.e., the variance). The non-linear least squares estimator (NLLSE) is derived, and its performance studied. We show that the NLLSE is not asymptotically efficient. This is in contrast with the case of harmonic signals in colored noise. The asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the NLLSE is studied both analytically and through simulations. It is seen that the larger the bandwidth of the noise, the larger the ARE. Although the NLLSE is not efficient, it provides a good compromise between computational complexity and estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751566","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

This paper examines application of thinned arrays to an airborne radar that employs space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to reject ground clutter. It is shown that the rank of the clutter covariance matrix depends on the precise thinned configuration. Upper and lower bounds for the clutter covariance matrix are provided. An irregularly spaced thinned array can have the same rank as a filled array if all potential synthetic aperture positions get sampled at least once during the coherent processing interval. Beamspace STAP approaches with irregularly spaced arrays generally require more degrees of freedom (DOF) than that of a filled array because a thinned array beamspace transform cannot generally effect shifted subaperture beams. With additional DOF (and still much less than fully adaptive) a randomly spaced thinned array beamspace approach call still provide relatively low loss and avoid the additional angle-Doppler blind zones that result from regularly spaced thinned arrays.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751584","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1541 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

The signals are assumed to be corrupted by both multipath fading and multiple access interference (MAI). To boost performance (measured either in BER for each user or in user capacity), we are interested in using jointly for the signal detection three key signal detection technologies: (1) RAKE processing, (2) array processing, and (3) multi-user detection. The resulting space-time multi-user detectors (ST-MUDs) have been shown in previous works to offer significant improvements over previously existing techniques. In this paper we focus on a specific type of linear detector presented by Huang and Papadias (see Proc. 1998 PIMRC Conference, Boston, 1998), which has been shown to combine good performance with implementation advantages. We propose to update this linear detector with adaptive filtering algorithms, and in particular with stochastic-gradient type trained or blind algorithms. It is shown that, such simple techniques allow the receiver to approach the ST-MUD MMSE solution and achieve significant capacity gains with respect to conventional techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multi-user detection of fading CDMA channels using antenna arrays","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

It is well known that for stationary, i.i.d. sources the answer is negative due to the inherent unitary matrix ambiguity of the output second order information. It is shown however that if the sources' power is allowed to vary with time, unique identifiability is guaranteed without resorting to higher order statistics. In many applications the sources' power does change with time (e.g., speech or fading communication signals), and therefore the result has practical relevance. A novel second order source separation method is proposed based on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition of appropriate correlation matrices and the identifiability conditions are investigated. Asymptotic performance results for the output SIR are developed.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751591","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

In this context, we study the behavior of the schemes based on the maximization of a fourth-order cumulant based contrast function, which are known to be consistent if the source signals are filtered versions of i.i.d. sequences. We first address the non-iterative separation approach sketched recently by Comon and Moreau (see IEEE SP Letters, vol.3, no.7, p.209-21, 1996) and Pesquet (see IEEE SP Letters, vol.4, no.6, p.182-83, 1996), and explain why it seems questionable in the non i.i.d. source signals case. Next, we show that if the sources are extracted iteratively, then the maximization of the absolute value of the fourth-order cumulant allows to separate the sources in the non i.i.d. case. We finally establish that, as in the i.i.d. case, this contrast function is free of spurious local maximum.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751593","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

We consider a multiuser environment with K synchronous co-channel users, each is equipped with N transmit antennas and uses the space-time block coding. By exploiting the temporal and spatial structure of these codes, we develop a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) interference suppression technique. Assuming that the receiver uses M/spl ges/K receive antennas, these technique will perfectly suppress the interference from the K-1 co-channel space-time users and provide a diversity order of N/spl times/(M-K+1) to each of the K users. Moreover, this MMSE solution tends itself to an adaptive implementation and does not require any explicit knowledge about the interference. In conjunction with this interference suppression technique, we show how space-time block codes can be used to increasing the capacity and/or data rate of wireless communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751635","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

Experiments shows that compared to plain matched filter clearly better performance is achieved with only a little increment in computation.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1998.751644","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of Thirty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat.

In a cell-based network, a mobile should be able to seamlessly obtain transmission resources after handoff to a new basestation. This is essential for both service continuity and quality of service assurance. We present strategies for accommodating continuous service to mobile users through estimating resource requirements of potential handoff connections. A diverse mix of heterogeneous traffic with diverse resource requirements is considered. We investigate static and dynamic resource allocation schemes. The dynamic scheme probabilistically estimates the potential number of connections that will be handed off from neighboring cells, for each class of traffic. The performance of these strategies in terms of connection blocking probabilities for handoff and local new connection requests are evaluated. The performance is also compared to a scheme previously proposed by Yu and Leung (see IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol.15, p.1208-25, 1997). The results indicate that using dynamic estimation and allocation, we can significantly reduce the dropping probability for handoff connections.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation during handoff through dynamic schemes for mobile multimedia wireless networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

The currently accepted approach for the design of GPS schedulers is based on deterministic QoS guarantees, which, it is generally accepted, is overly conservative and leads to limitations on capacity. We develop a framework for GPS scheduling which is based on statistical QoS guarantees and statistical multiplexing. We give the design of GPS weights which maximize the coverage of operating points, and also the design of the connection admission control (CAC). The general framework is end-to-end, with two heterogeneous QoS classes coexisting with a third, best effort class. Each QoS class has a specified delay bound together with a bound on the probability of its violation. An important objective is to maximize the bandwidth available to best effort traffic, while just satisfying the guarantees of the QoS classes. To this end, we consider output regulated GPS scheduling, which limits each connection's share of the bandwidth to a designed value. The sources are subject to standard dual leaky bucket regulation. For the design of the GPS weights we give procedures based on two key concepts, the realizable set and the critical weights. The realizable set is the union of all admissible sets of connections of both classes over all weights. One of the main contributions is a pragmatic design process by which most of the realizable set is realized by only two critical weights. The numerical results show that there are substantial capacity gains from statistical multiplexing.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.751679","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

This paper deals with modeling of PDIV of epoxy-resin post insulators using a neural network (NN). The PDIV is obtained experimentally for various shapes and sizes of post insulators, with a working voltage in the range of 3.3 to 33 kV. The electrode spacing d and creepage length l are the key parameters employed for the present modeling. An adaptively trained multilayer NN is employed for the modeling. Detailed studies are carried out to optimize the NN parameters for minimum error. The model results obtained closely follow the experimental data indicating the effectiveness of NN as an efficient tool in estimation of PDIV of epoxy-resin postinsulators.","doi":"10.1109/94.752021","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/16238/00752021.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.752021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling PD inception voltage of epoxy resin post insulators using an adaptive neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Modeling PD inception voltage of epoxy resin post insulators using an adaptive neural network","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6196853","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling PD inception voltage of epoxy resin post insulators using an adaptive neural network","sourcePdf":"00752021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046095S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"14","articleId":"752021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":752051,"authors":[{"name":"Shie Qian","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Department, National Instruments Company"],"lastName":"Shie Qian","id":"37068602500"},{"name":"Dapang Chen","affiliation":["Advanced Signal Processing Department, National Instruments Company"],"lastName":"Dapang Chen","id":"37363518000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"752051","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":232,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4327},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms","Signal representations","Power engineering and energy","Signal design","Frequency domain analysis","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal representation","time-frequency analysis","spectral analysis","Fourier transforms","reviews","Wigner distribution","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint time-frequency analysis","signal representation","engineering applications","frequency domain","frequency content","power spectrum","Gabor expansion","wavelets","time-dependent spectra","algorithms","Fourier analysis","short-time Fourier transform","quadratic transforms","linear transforms","model-based time-frequency analysis method","parametric time-frequency analysis method"]}],"abstract":"It has been well understood that a given signal can be represented in an infinite number of different ways. Different signal representations can be used for different applications. For example, signals obtained from most engineering applications are usually functions of time. But when studying or designing the system, we often like to study signals and systems in the frequency domain. Although the frequency content of the majority of signals in the real world evolves over time, the classical power spectrum does not reveal such important information. In order to overcome this problem, many alternatives, such as the Gabor (1946) expansion, wavelets, and time-dependent spectra, have been developed and widely studied. In contrast to the classical time and frequency analysis, we name these new techniques joint time-frequency analysis. We introduce the basic concepts and well-tested algorithms for joint time-frequency analysis. Analogous to the classical Fourier analysis, we roughly partition this article into two parts: the linear (e.g., short-time Fourier transform, Gabor expansion) and the quadratic transforms (e.g., Wigner-Ville (1932, 1948) distribution). Finally, we introduce the so-called model-based (or parametric) time-frequency analysis method.","doi":"10.1109/79.752051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/16244/00752051.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.752051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","startPage":"52","endPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint time-frequency analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Joint time-frequency analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752051/","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6207654","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint time-frequency analysis","sourcePdf":"00752051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072126S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"232","articleId":"752051","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":752052,"authors":[{"name":"Youhong Lu","affiliation":["DSP Department, Carrier Systems, 3Com Corporation"],"lastName":"Youhong Lu","id":"37367370800"},{"name":"J.M.

The Gabor expansion can be defined as a discrete-time signal representation in the joint time-frequency domain of a weighted sum of the collection of functions (known as the synthesis functions). There are several design issues in the echo canceller based on the Gabor expansion: the design of the analysis functions for the far-end speech, the design of the analysis functions for the near-end signal containing the echo plus the near-end speech, the design of the adaptive filters in the subsignal path, and the design of the synthesis functions.

First, we propose and simulate a novel robust dynamic yaw-moment control (DYC). DYC is a vehicle attitude control method that generates yaw from torque differences between the right and left wheels. The results of simulations, however, identify a problem with instability on slippery, low /spl mu/ roads. To solve this problem, a new skid detection method is proposed that will be a part of traction control system (TCS) for each drive wheel. The experimental results show that this method can detect a skidding wheel, without any information on chassis velocity. Therefore, this method will be of great help during cornering or braking in a TCS. These methods will be integrated and tested in our new experimental EV.","doi":"10.1109/3516.752079","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3516/16239/00752079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.752079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16239","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion control in an electric vehicle with four independently driven in-wheel motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion control in an electric vehicle with four independently driven in-wheel motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6204506","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion control in an electric vehicle with four independently driven in-wheel motors","sourcePdf":"00752079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035945S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"228","articleId":"752079","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752082,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Although the VSC possesses some advantages (e.g., fast response, less sensitive to uncertainties, and easy implementation), the chattering control input often occurs. The reason for a chattering control input is that the switching control in the VSC is used to cope with the uncertainties. The larger the uncertainties which arise, the larger switching control occurs. In this paper, an RBFNN is employed to model the uncertainties caused by parameter variations, friction, external load, and controller. A new weight updating law using a revision of e-modification by a time varying dead zone can achieve an exponential stability without the assumption of persistent excitation for the uncertainties or radial basis function. Then, an RBFNN-based VSC is constructed such that some part of uncertainties are tackled, that the tracking performance is improved, and that the level of chattering control input is attenuated. Finally, the stability of the overall system is verified by the Lyapunov stability criterion.","doi":"10.1109/3516.752084","startPage":"50","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3516/16239/00752084.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.752084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based variable structure control of electrohydraulic servosystems subject to huge uncertainties without persistent excitation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric variables control","Electrohydraulics","Servosystems","Uncertainty","Control systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Mechanical variables control","Friction","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servomechanisms","electrohydraulic control equipment","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","variable structure systems","uncertain systems","time-varying systems","absolute stability","stability criteria","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-based variable structure control","electrohydraulic servosystems","uncertainties","radial-basis-function neural network","RBFNN","VSC","VSS","chattering control input","parameter variations","friction","external load","weight updating law","e-modification","time varying dead zone","exponential stability","Lyapunov stability criterion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based variable structure control of electrohydraulic servosystems subject to huge uncertainties without persistent excitation","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6204511","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based variable structure control of electrohydraulic servosystems subject to huge uncertainties without persistent excitation","sourcePdf":"00752084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"41","articleId":"752084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":752088,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two phenomena have been found to be mainly responsible for it, namely, the arm structural elasticity due to the torsional flexibility of the joints and the torque ripple of the brushless motors. The structural elasticity is characterized by a resonance frequency which varies with the arm configuration, while the torque ripple has harmonics of frequency proportional to the motor velocity. Most severe oscillations, and even loss of the contact, arise when the resonance and ripple frequency values come closer or match, so that elasticity and ripple excite each other.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6204514","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Force oscillations in contact motion of industrial robots: an experimental investigation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force oscillations in contact motion of industrial robots: an experimental investigation","sourcePdf":"00752088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03721S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"18","articleId":"752088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752091,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The problem of minimizing the memory cost is important since memory accesses, memory bandwidth limitations, and in general the correct handling of the data flows have become the true critical issues in designing high-speed and low-power video-processing architectures and in efficiently using multimedia processors. For instance, the straightforward implementation of a multiresolution texture codec typically needs an extra memory buffer of the same size as the image to be encoded/decoded. We propose a new calculation schedule that reduces this buffer memory size with up to two orders of magnitude, while still ensuring a number of external (off-chip) memory accesses that is very close to the theoretical minimum. The analysis is generic and is therefore useful for both wavelet and multiresolution DCT codecs.","doi":"10.1109/76.752091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"218","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16242/00752091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.752091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal memory organization for scalable texture codecs in MPEG-4","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","MPEG 4 Standard","Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Facial animation","Layout","Costs","Bandwidth","Image resolution","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","telecommunication standards","video codecs","optimisation","buffer storage","image texture","image resolution","transform coding","discrete cosine transforms","wavelet transforms","file organisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable texture codecs","MPEG-4","optimal memory organization","memory accesses","multiresolution texture coding architecture","discrete cosine transform","DCT","wavelet-based schemes","virtual-world walk-throughs","facial animation scenes","memory cost","memory bandwidth limitations","data flows","video-processing architecture","low-power architecture","high-speed architecture","multimedia processors","multiresolution texture codec","buffer memory size reduction","multiresolution DCT codec","wavelet codec"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Optimal memory organization for scalable texture codecs in MPEG-4","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6218748","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752091/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal memory organization for scalable texture codecs in MPEG-4","sourcePdf":"00752091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054182S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"48","articleId":"752091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":752098,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In connectivity compression, after obtaining the vertex and triangle spanning trees by decomposing a three-dimensional object, bits are adaptively allocated to each run of two spanning trees on a threshold basis. The threshold is the length of a binary number of the maximum run length. If a run length exceeds the threshold, it is represented by a binary number of the run length. Otherwise, it is represented by a bit sequence. Therefore, compression efficiency is enhanced through an adaptive bit allocation to each run of two spanning trees. In geometry compression, since vertices represented by three-dimensional vectors are stored according to the order of the travelling along vertex spanning tree by depth-first searching, they have geometrical closeness. The geometry compression efficiency can be improved if the local characteristics of vectors are considered. Therefore, dynamic finite state vector quantization, which has subcodebooks depending on a local characteristic of vectors, is used to encode the geometry information. As it dynamically constructs a subcodebook by predicting an input vector's state, it produces less distortion and gives better visual quality than conventional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16242/00752102.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.752102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.752102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topological surgery encoding improvements based on adaptive bit allocation and DFSVQ","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Encoding","Bit rate","Image coding","Vector quantization","Information geometry","Internet","Energy resolution","Business","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","vector quantisation","topology","trees (mathematics)","binary sequences","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topological surgery encoding","adaptive bit allocation","DFSVQ","connectivity compression","vertex","triangle spanning trees","three-dimensional object decomposition","threshold","geometry compression","bit sequence","three-dimensional vectors","depth-first searching","geometry compression efficiency","local characteristics","dynamic finite state VQ","subcodebooks","distortion","visual quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Topological surgery encoding improvements based on adaptive bit allocation and DFSVQ","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6218759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topological surgery encoding improvements based on adaptive bit allocation and DFSVQ","sourcePdf":"00752102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038758S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","articleId":"752102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":752106,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

These bounds are obtained from a partial distance spectrum. On Gaussian channels, the upper bound converges to the lower bound at moderate to large signal-to-noise ratios. However, on fading channels the upper bound does not converge, hence we present our results for the lower bound only.

Specific codes have been constructed using design criteria derived for quasi-static flat Rayleigh or Rician fading, where channel state information is available at the receiver. It is evident that the practicality of space-time codes will be greatly enhanced if the derived design criteria remain valid in the absence of perfect channel state information. It is even more desirable that the design criteria not be unduly sensitive to frequency selectivity and to the Doppler spread. This paper presents a theoretical study of these issues beginning with the effect of channel estimation error. Here it is assumed that a channel estimator extracts fade coefficients at the receiver and for constellations with constant energy, it is proved that in the absence of ideal channel state information the design criteria for space-time codes is still valid. The analysis also demonstrates that standard channel estimation techniques can be used in conjunction with space-time codes provided that the number of transmit antennas is small. We also derive the maximum-likelihood detection metric in the presence of channel estimation errors. Next, the effect of multiple paths on the performance of space-time codes is studied for a slowly changing Rayleigh channel. It is proved that the presence of multiple paths does not decrease the diversity order guaranteed by the design criteria used to construct the space-time codes. Similar results hold for rapid fading channels with or without multiple paths. The conclusion is that the diversity order promised by space-time coding is achieved under a variety of mobility conditions and environmental effects.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752125","doi":"10.1109/26.752125","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752125.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time codes for high data rate wireless communication: performance criteria in the presence of channel estimation errors, mobility, and multiple paths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-time codes for high data rate wireless communication: performance criteria in the presence of channel estimation errors, mobility, and multiple paths","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6212389","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time codes for high data rate wireless communication: performance criteria in the presence of channel estimation errors, mobility, and multiple paths","sourcePdf":"00752125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027995S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"396","articleId":"752125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752126,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The derived result is to retain only those paths which are closest to the received signal in the Euclidean (Hamming) distance sense. Each member in the SA(B, C) family of sequence detectors (SA denotes search algorithm) performs complexity constrained MLSD for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) (BSC) channel. The unconstrained solution is the Viterbi algorithm (VA). Analysis tools are developed for each member of the SA(B, C) class and the asymptotic (SNR) probability of losing the correct path is associated with a new Euclidean distance measure for the AWGN case, the vector Euclidean distance (VED). The traditional Euclidean distance is a scalar special case of this, termed the scalar Euclidean distance (SED). The generality of this VED is pointed out. Some general complexity reductions exemplify those associated with the VA approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breadth-first maximum likelihood sequence detection: basics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.752126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752126.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Breadth-first maximum likelihood sequence detection: basics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6212390","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breadth-first maximum likelihood sequence detection: basics","sourcePdf":"00752126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054322S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"66","articleId":"752126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":752127,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["Wireless Systems Research Department, AT and T Research Laboratories, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Ye Li","id":"37279890200"},{"name":"N.R.

For OFDM systems with cochannel interference, adaptive antenna arrays can be used for interference suppression. This paper focuses on a key issue for adaptive antenna arrays, that is, parameter estimation for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) diversity combiner (DC). Using the instantaneous correlation estimation approach developed in the paper, an original parameter estimator for the MMSE-DC is derived. Based on the original estimator, we propose an enhanced parameter estimator.

Finally, we present Monte Carlo simulation results to verify our analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752131.pdf","doi":"10.1109/26.752131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752131","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding and equalization for PPM on wireless infrared channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752131/","displayDocTitle":"Coding and equalization for PPM on wireless infrared channels","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6212395","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding and equalization for PPM on wireless infrared channels","sourcePdf":"00752131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041786S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","articleId":"752131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752132,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"lastName":"Wei Huang","id":"37362988200"},{"name":"I.

Coherent optical pulse CDMA systems based on coherent correlation detection (CCD) through homodyne correlation detection (HCD) and self-HCD directly in the optical domain is proposed. With HCD, optical sequences from a pulsed laser, modulated by the data and encoded by an optical tapped delay-line encoder, are multiplexed in an optical fiber network. At the receiver, the optical code sequence of the intended user is locally generated. Through proper code and carrier phase synchronization, the local optical code is multiplied with the received signal chip by chip via an optical correlator consisting of a 3-dB coupler and a balanced detector. Thresholding is performed in the electrical domain after integration of the optical correlator output over one bit interval. The self HCD approach utilizes two bipolar code sequences multiplexed alternately in time, obviating the need for the generation of a local code at the receiver. The received signal is divided at the receiver, decoded by two encoders (matched to those at the transmitters), and correlated via the optical correlator. The removal for the need of the local oscillator avoids the stringent implementation issues with HCD such as optical frequency stability and carrier phase noise. Following a description of the two implementations, system performances are theoretically analyzed and a comparison of the several approaches given.","doi":"10.1109/26.752132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752132.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent optical pulse CDMA systems based on coherent correlation detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Coherent optical pulse CDMA systems based on coherent correlation detection","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6212396","volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent optical pulse CDMA systems based on coherent correlation detection","sourcePdf":"00752132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025159S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","articleId":"752132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":752133,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Yang","affiliation":["Sharp Microelectronics Technologies Inc., Camas, WA, USA","AirTouch Communications, Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Yang","id":"37350848200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"752133","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752133","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Bit error rate","Diversity methods","Multiaccess communication","Search engines","Delay","Multipath channels","Traffic control","Wideband","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","radio receivers","error statistics","telecommunication traffic","cellular radio","search engines","multipath channels","fading channels","delays","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity receiver","system performance evaluation","CDMA system","code-division multiple-access","frame-error rate","bit-error rate","BER","forward traffic channel","simulation system","TIA/EIA/IS-95","adaptive search engine","adaptive rate","high diversity gain","wide-band multipath fading models","tapped delay-line","multipath channel characteristics","distributed antennas","mean delay spread","chip interval","system capacity","self-interference","outdoor environment","indoor environment","personal communications services","Joint Technical Committee","DS-SS"]}],"abstract":"Performance of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system is studied. The frame-error rate (FER) and bit-error rate (BER) of the forward traffic channel are obtained by using a simulation system based on TIA/EIA/IS-95. A diversity receiver structure with an adaptive search engine is developed and analyzed. The adaptive rate of the search engine is optimized to achieve high diversity gain. The diversity gain factor is derived based on a cluster of wide-band tapped delay-line multipath fading models. The relationships between receiver diversity gain, multipath channel characteristics, and the number of distributed antennas are derived. The multipath channel characteristics have a major impact on the system performance. Simulation shows that when channel mean delay spread is less than the chip interval, a distributed antenna system is essential for improving the system capacity. When more users are served in the system, FER is more sensitive to the channel characteristics. Uncaptured energy acts as self-interference, which can increase the BER by an order of magnitude and reduce system capacities, FER could also be improved by reducing the resolution of the diversity receiver branches to one half of the chip interval. The system performance for the indoor and outdoor environments are evaluated by utilizing the proposed diversity receiver over typical personal communications services channel models specified by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC).","doi":"10.1109/26.752133","startPage":"272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752133.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752133","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity receiver scheme and system performance evaluation for a CDMA system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Diversity receiver scheme and system performance evaluation for a CDMA system","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6212397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity receiver scheme and system performance evaluation for a CDMA system","sourcePdf":"00752133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066591S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","articleId":"752133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":752135,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A recirculation loop is used to improve probability of synchro cell detection P/sub D/ in each retrace of the code uncertainty region. To further improve P/sub D/ and probability of false alarm P/sub fa/ simultaneously, code diversity (a number of synchro channels in parallel) is used. This is especially effective in the channel with multiple access interference and near-far effect. Typical applications are networks with very low signal-to-noise ratio. Examples are code division multiple access (CDMA) LEO satellite systems experiencing high Doppler or any CDMA network where the number of users is approaching capacity limits. Even if the carrier Doppler is compensated, in any asynchronous LEO satellite network, compensation of code Doppler is not feasible. For this reason, in order to cope with code Doppler (D) and delay (/spl tau/), a modification based on transforming the two-dimensional uncertainty region (D, /spl tau/) into a new uncertainty region (T/sub c/, /spl tau/) will be introduced. Parameter T/sub c/ is the period of the correlation pulses at the output of a sliding correlator. When Doppler rate is present, the three-dimensional uncertainty region (D, R/sub d/, /spl tau/) is transformed into a new one (T/sub c/, R/sub t/, /spl tau/) where R/sub d/ and R/sub t/ are Doppler rate and correlation pulse period change rate, respectively. The main motivation for this work is to find new algorithms suitable for all digital receiver implementation and operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. These algorithms make CDMA techniques feasible for direct communication between LEO satellite and small ground-based user terminals (handsets). A comprehensive performance study of the new PN code acquisition system is presented and discussed. The results obtained demonstrate that, for low signal-to noise ratios, the acquisition time achieved with the new algorithm is one order of magnitude shorter compared with standard techniques known so far.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16240/00752136.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.752136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New PN code acquisition scheme for CDMA networks with low signal-to-noise ratios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Uncertainty","Low earth orbit satellites","Delay","Convolution","Signal analysis","Multiple access interference","Correlators","Artificial satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","code division multiple access","diversity reception","Doppler effect","correlation theory","spread spectrum communication","satellite communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PN code acquisition scheme","CDMA networks","low signal-to-noise ratios","recirculation loop","probability","synchro cell detection","code uncertainty region","false alarm","code diversity","synchro channels","multiple access interference","near-far effect","code division multiple access","LEO satellite systems","high Doppler","carrier Doppler","code Doppler","delay","correlation pulses","sliding correlator","Doppler rate","algorithms","digital receiver","direct communication","small ground-based user terminals","handsets","performance","acquisition time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"New PN code acquisition scheme for CDMA networks with low signal-to-noise ratios","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6212400","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New PN code acquisition scheme for CDMA networks with low signal-to-noise ratios","sourcePdf":"00752136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089068S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"752136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":752146,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Bo Li","id":"37280001600"},{"name":"M.J.

To address these problems, we propose a prefix caching technique whereby a proxy stores the initial frames of popular clips. Upon receiving a request for the stream, the proxy initiates transmission to the client and simultaneously requests the remaining frames from the server. In addition to hiding the delay, throughput, and loss effects of a weaker service model between the server and the proxy, this novel yet simple prefix caching technique aids the proxy in performing workahead smoothing into the client playback buffer. By transmitting large frames in advance of each burst, workahead smoothing substantially reduces the peak and variability of the network resource requirements along the path from the proxy to the client. We describe how to construct a smooth transmission schedule, based on the size of the prefix, smoothing, and playback buffers, without increasing client playback delay. Experiments with MPEG traces show how a few megabytes of buffer space at the proxy can substantially reduce the bandwidth requirements of variable-bit-rate video. Drawing on these results, we present guidelines for allocating buffer space for each stream, and how to effectively share buffer and bandwidth resources among multiple clients and streams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752149/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6346014","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"21-25 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Proxy prefix caching for multimedia streams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proxy prefix caching for multimedia streams","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00752149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052274S","chronDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6063","citationCount":"288","articleId":"752149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":752150,"authors":[{"name":"W.-C.

However, even with these enhancements, TCP connections still experience alarmingly high loss rates, especially during times of congestion. To alleviate this problem, the IETF is considering active queue management mechanisms, such as random early detection (RED), for deployment in the network. In this paper, we first show that the effectiveness of RED depends, to a large extent, on the appropriate parameterization of the RED queue. We then show that there is no single set of RED parameters that work well under different congestion scenarios. In light of this observation, we propose and experiment with more adaptive RED gateways which self-parameterize themselves based on the traffic mix. The results show that traffic cognizant parameterization of RED gateways can effectively reduce packet loss, while maintaining high link utilizations under a range of network loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","conferenceDate":"21-25 March 1999","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6346015","displayDocTitle":"A self-configuring RED gateway","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-configuring RED gateway","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00752150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077432S","chronDate":"21-25 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6063","citationCount":"271","articleId":"752150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":752152,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Most of today's Internet traffic is TCP, and we expect this to remain so in the future. Thus, having \"TCP-friendly\" behavior is crucial for new applications. However, the emergence of non-congestion-controlled realtime applications threatens unfairness to competing TCP traffic and possible congestion collapse. We present an end-to-end TCP-friendly rate adaptation protocol (RAP), which employs an additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm. It is well suited for unicast playback of realtime streams and other semi-reliable rate-based applications. Its primary goal is to be fair and TCP-friendly while separating network congestion control from application-level reliability. We evaluate RAP through extensive simulation, and conclude that bandwidth is usually evenly shared between TCP and RAP traffic. Unfairness to TCP traffic is directly determined by how TCP diverges from the AIMD algorithm. Basic RAP behaves in a TCP-friendly fashion in a wide range of likely conditions, but we also devised a fine-grain rate adaptation mechanism to extend this range further. Finally, we show that deploying RED queue management can result in an ideal fairness between TCP and RAP traffic.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1999.752152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16232","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1345 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Like RED (random early detection) SRED pre-emptively discards packets with a load-dependent probability when a buffer in a router in the Internet or an intranet seems congested. SRED has an additional feature that over a wide range of load levels helps it stabilize its buffer occupation at a level independent of the number of active connections. SRED does this by estimating the number of active connections or flows. This estimate is obtained without collecting or analyzing state information on individual flows. The same mechanism can be used to identify flows that may be misbehaving, i.e. are taking more than their fair share of bandwidth. Since the mechanism is statistical in nature, the next step must be to collect state information of the candidates for \"misbehaving\", and to analyze that information. We show that candidate rows thus identified indeed have a high posterior probability of taking a larger than average amount of bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

Instead of the constant velocity fluid-flow or the random-walk mobility model, a more realistic Gauss-Markov model is introduced, where a mobile's velocity is correlated in time to a various degree. Based on the Gauss-Markov model, a mobile's future location is predicted by the network based on the information gathered from the mobile's last report of location and velocity. When a call is made, the network pages the destination mobile at and around the predicted location of the mobile and in the order of descending probability until the mobile is found. A mobile shares the same prediction information with the network and reports its new location whenever it reaches some threshold distance away from the predicted location. We describe an analytical framework to evaluate the cost of mobility management for the proposed predictive distance-based scheme. We then compare this cost against that of the regular, non-predictive distance-based scheme, which is obtained through simulations. Performance advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under various mobility and call patterns, update cost, page cost, and frequencies of mobile location inspections.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1999.752157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16232","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1384 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

The routing table lookup operation is time consuming because the part of an IP address used in the lookup, i.e., the network address portion, is variable in length. This paper describes the routing table lookup algorithm used in a cluster-based parallel IP router project called Suez. The innovative aspect of this algorithm is its ability to use CPU caching hardware to perform routing table caching and lookup directly by carefully mapping IP addresses to virtual addresses. By running a detailed simulation model that incorporates the performance effects of the CPU memory hierarchy against a packet trace collected from a major network router, we show that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm can reach 87.87 million lookups per second for a 500-MHz Alpha processor with a 16-KByte L1 cache and a 1-MByte L2 cache. This result is one to two orders of magnitude faster than previously reported results on software-based routing table lookup implementations. This paper also reports the performance impacts of various architectural parameters in the proposed scheme and its storage costs, together with the measurements of an implementation of the proposed scheme on a Pentium-II machine running Linux.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.752162","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

For each incoming IP packet, the IP routing requires to perform a longest prefix matching on the address lookup in order to determine the packet's next hop. This paper presents a fast route lookup mechanism that only needs tiny SRAM and can be implemented in a pipelined skill in hardware. Based on the proposed scheme, the forwarding table is tiny enough to fit in SRAM with very low cost. For example, a large routing table with 40,000 routing entries can be compacted to a forwarding table of 450-470 Kbytes. In the worst case, the number of memory accesses for a lookup is three. When implemented in a pipeline skill in hardware, the proposed mechanism can achieve one routing lookup every memory access. With current 10 ns SRAM, this mechanism furnishes approximately 100 million routing lookups per second. This is much faster than any current commercially available routing lookup schemes.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1999.752163","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '99. Conference on Computer Communications.

Previous results suggest that error control schemes using forward error correction (FEC) are good candidates for decreasing the impact of packet loss on audio quality. However, the FEC scheme must be coupled to a rate control scheme. Furthermore, the amount of redundant information used at any given point in time should also depend on the characteristics of the loss process at that time (it would make no sense to send much redundant information when the channel is loss free), on the end to end delay constraints (destination typically have to wait longer to decode the FEC as more FEC information is used), on the quality of the redundant information, etc. However, it is not clear given all these constraints how to choose the \"best\" possible redundant information. We address this issue, and illustrate the approach using an FEC scheme for packet audio standardized in the IETF. We show that the problem of finding the best redundant information can be expressed mathematically as a constrained optimization problem for which we give explicit solutions. We obtain from these solutions a simple algorithm with very interesting features, namely (i) the algorithm optimizes a subjective measure (such as the audio quality perceived at a destination) as opposed to an objective measure of quality (such as the packet loss rate at a destination), (ii) it incorporates the constraints of rate control and playout delay adjustment schemes, and (iii) it adapts to varying loss conditions in the network (estimated online with RTCP feedback). We have been using the algorithm, together with a TCP-friendly rate control scheme and we have found it to provide very good audio quality even over paths with high and varying loss rates.

A weighted combination of many uncorrelated topographic profiles strongly reduces the impact of phase artifacts on the final DEM. The key issue is weights selection. In the present article a wavelet domain approach is proposed. Taking advantage of the particular frequency trend of the atmospheric distortion, it is possible to estimate, directly from the data, noise and atmospheric distortion power for each interferogram. The available DEMs are then combined by means of a weighted average, carried out in the wavelet domain. This new approach provides a valuable tool not only for DEMs combination (improving accuracy), but for data evaluation and selection, since the phase error power is estimated for each interferogram.

This method, called convex cone analysis (CCA), is based on the bet that some physical quantities such as radiance are nonnegative. The vectors formed by discrete radiance spectra are linear combinations of nonnegative components, and they lie inside a nonnegative, convex region. The object of CCA is to find the boundary points of this region, which can be used as endmember spectra for unmixing or as target vectors for classification. To implement this concept, the authors find the eigenvectors of the sample spectral correlation matrix of the image. Given the number of endmembers or classes, they select as many eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors are used as a basis to form linear combinations that have only nonnegative elements, and thus they lie inside a convex cone. The vertices of the convex cone will be those points whose spectral vector contains as many zero elements as the number of eigenvectors minus one. Accordingly, a mixed pixel can be decomposed by identifying the vertices that were used to form its spectrum. An algorithm for finding the convex cone boundaries is presented, and applications to unsupervised unmixing and classification are demonstrated with simulated data as well as experimental data from the hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE).","doi":"10.1109/36.752192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/16246/00752192.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.752192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis with convex cones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752192/","displayDocTitle":"Multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis with convex cones","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217532","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis with convex cones","sourcePdf":"00752192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045753S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"169","articleId":"752192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":752193,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyang Zhou","affiliation":["GDE Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Weiyang Zhou","id":"37087481692"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"752193","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Neural networks","Image classification","Testing","Remote sensing","Statistical analysis","Satellites","Computer networks","Geology","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysical signal processing","geophysics computing","remote sensing","terrain mapping","neural nets","backpropagation","multidimensional signal processing","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","land surface","terrain mapping","remote sensing","verification","nonparametric characteristics","backpropagation","neural network","neural net","image classification","Landsat","thematic mapper","optical imaging","multidimensional image processing","multispectral method","visible","IR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752193","abstract":"Experiments have been conducted with backpropagation neural networks for Landsat thematic mapper (TM) image classification. Specifically, two nonparametric characteristics of the neural networks were tested. The first test demonstrated the flexibility of the networks by comparing the results from three classifications with different schemes of target classes. Within each classification scheme, target classes with different separability from the others were defined using pixels with different degrees of homogeneity (or purity, compactness, and similarity) in terms of their distribution in the spectral bands. On one hand, neural networks' performance on pixels that were well represented by training pixels was consistently satisfactory, as indicated by the high-average classification accuracy for both training and testing pixels. On the other hand, however, with different training pixel sets, the neural networks performed inconsistently on other pixels that were not well represented by the training pixels. Only a small portion of pixels were classified into the same category under all three classification schemes. For the second test, additional input bands with known characteristics were classified with the TM bands. When a new method was used for interpreting the weights of a trained network, it was proven that the neural networks are able to adjust their weights in accordance with the importance of the role each input data source plays during the classification. In other words, when data of different sources are used for classification, it is not necessary to know their relative importance in advance. Instead, by interpreting the weights after training, the importance of each data source can be ranked based on its contribution to the classification so that the one that made the least contribution can be left out in future classification processes to save computation time.","doi":"10.1109/36.752193","startPage":"771","endPage":"779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.752193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/16246/00752193.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification of the nonparametric characteristics of backpropagation neural networks for image classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752193/","displayDocTitle":"Verification of the nonparametric characteristics of backpropagation neural networks for image classification","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6217533","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification of the nonparametric characteristics of backpropagation neural networks for image classification","sourcePdf":"00752193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02762S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"79","articleId":"752193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":752194,"authors":[{"name":"L.-K.

The authors used gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) to quantitatively evaluate textural parameters and representations and to determine which parameter values and representations are best for mapping sea ice texture. They conducted experiments on the quantization levels of the image and the displacement and orientation values of the GLCM by examining the effects textural descriptors such as entropy have in the representation of different sea ice textures. They showed that a complete gray-level representation of the image is not necessary for texture mapping, an eight-level quantization representation is undesirable for textural representation, and the displacement factor in texture measurements is more important than orientation. In addition, they developed three GLCM implementations and evaluated them by a supervised Bayesian classifier on sea ice textural contexts. This experiment concludes that the best GLCM implementation in representing sea ice texture is one that utilizes a range of displacement values such that both microtextures and macrotextures of sea ice can be adequately captured. These findings define the quantization, displacement, and orientation values that are the best for SAR sea ice texture analysis using GLCM.","doi":"10.1109/36.752194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.752194","endPage":"795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/16246/00752194.pdf","startPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture analysis of SAR sea ice imagery using gray level co-occurrence matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752194/","displayDocTitle":"Texture analysis of SAR sea ice imagery using gray level co-occurrence matrices","volume":"37","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6217534","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture analysis of SAR sea ice imagery using gray level co-occurrence matrices","sourcePdf":"00752194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054129S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"725","articleId":"752194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":752198,"authors":[{"name":"S.

First, to determine a scattering matrix from measurements with antennas having different antenna transfer functions between orthogonal polarizations, the authors present an antenna compensation algorithm that is achieved by an inverse filtering method with the antenna transfer functions experimentally determined by crosshole measurements. The results of crosshole and single-hole measurements carried out in granite at the Kamaishi Mine are shown to verify the proposed method. In the crosshole measurement, the authors find that the used dipole and slot antennas have almost the same radiation pattern and frequency dependency from 50 to 120 MHz. The transmission matrices through the host rock are the unit matrix for most paths, while depolarization is observed in some sections. Reflections from subsurface fractures show significant depolarization in the polarimetric single-hole reflection measurements. Using the scattering matrix, it is evaluated that subsurface fractures have a randomly isotropic rough surface for wavelengths between 1 and 2 m on the rotation of polarization basis.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.752199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16246","startPage":"828","endPage":"837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/16246/00752199.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subsurface fracture measurement with polarimetric borehole radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Subsurface fracture measurement with polarimetric borehole radar","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217539","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subsurface fracture measurement with polarimetric borehole radar","sourcePdf":"00752199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030756S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"75","articleId":"752199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":752207,"authors":[{"name":"H.

One problem with ground penetrating radars is the strong backscattered signal from the ground surface. If the object is buried deeply below the surface this is no problem since the backscattered signal from the surface will arrive earlier than the target signal and we only have to gate the time signal. When the objects are shallowly buried gating is not possible since the backscattered signal from target and the surface will arrive almost simultaneously. The detection problem is thus to a large extent the problem of separating the target signal from the ground backscatter. In the present paper, the authors introduce a signal model that exploits the different properties of the backscattered signals from target and ground surface. Different algorithms for separation of the different components in the signal model are presented together with a performance measure to evaluate the algorithms. After the signal components have been separated, both classical detection methods and some more ad hoc methods are applied and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/36.752207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/16247/00752207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.752207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16247","startPage":"875","endPage":"886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of shallowly buried objects using impulse radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of shallowly buried objects using impulse radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217547","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of shallowly buried objects using impulse radar","sourcePdf":"00752207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026352S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"101","articleId":"752207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":752208,"authors":[{"name":"Tie Jun Cui","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Tie Jun Cui","id":"37277085000"},{"name":"Weng Cho Chew","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Weng Cho Chew","id":"37277279700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"752208","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":996},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic radiation","Electromagnetic scattering","Radar scattering","Buried object detection","Dielectrics","Message-oriented middleware","Moment methods","Geophysics computing","Integral equations","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","terrestrial electricity","terrain mapping","buried object detection","remote sensing by radar","radar cross-sections","backscatter","method of moments","Green's function methods","radar theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical measurement technique","terrain mapping","buried object detection","Sommerfeld integral","fast evaluation","radar remote sensing","EM scattering","three-dimensional buried object","ground penetrating radar","backscatter","radar scattering","electromagnetic scattering","symmetrical form","Green's function","steepest descent path","leading-order approximation","method of moments","conducting object","dielectric object","numerical results","terrestrial electricity","geoelectric method"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a fast method for electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems pertinent to three-dimensional (3D) buried objects.

Among the areas over which radar data were collected was the young jack pine (YJP) tower site in the south, which is generally characterized as having short (2-4 m) but closely spaced trees with a dense crown layer. In this work, the AIRSAR data over this YJP stand from six different dates were used, and the dielectric constant and hence the moisture content of its branch layer components were estimated. The approach was to first derive a parametric scattering model from a numerical discrete-component forest model, which is possible if the predominant scattering mechanism can be identified. Here, a classification algorithm was used for this purpose, concentrating on areas where the volume scattering mechanism from the branch layer dominates. The unknown parameters mere taken to be the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, from which the moisture content can be derived. Once the parametric model was derived, a nonlinear estimation algorithm was employed to retrieve the model parameters from SAR data. This algorithm is iterative, and takes the statistical properties of the data and unknown parameters into account. The inversion process was first verified using synthetic data. It was observed that the algorithm is robust with respect to the a priori estimate. The estimation algorithm was then applied to AIRSAR data of BOREAS. The results show how the environmental conditions affected the moisture state of this forest stand over a period of six months. It is observed that canopy moisture increased during the thaw season, was stable starting from the end of the thaw season throughout most of the growing season, after which a period of dry-down was observed at the end of the growing season.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","volume":"37","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6217549","publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring tree moisture using an estimation algorithm applied to SAR data from BOREAS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring tree moisture using an estimation algorithm applied to SAR data from BOREAS","sourcePdf":"00752209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061415S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"45","articleId":"752209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":752210,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Huo Liu","id":"37277487800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"752210","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":693},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Acoustic measurements","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic propagation","Partial differential equations","Chebyshev approximation","Spatial resolution","Acoustic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","buried object detection","buried object detection","terrestrial electricity","seismology","remote sensing by radar","fast Fourier transforms","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale simulation","geophysical measurement technique","electromagnetic method","acoustic method","pseudospectral time-domain algorithm","EM wave propagation","fast Fourier transform","FFT algorithm","spatial derivatives","perfectly matched layer","wraparound effect","spatial periodicity","finite-difference time-domain method","multiresolution time-domain method","large-scale problem","subsurface method","buried object detection","explosion seismology","radar remote sensing","terrestrial electricity","geoelectric method"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm was developed to simulate electromagnetic wave propagation.

The PSTD algorithm is then applied to simulate large-scale problems for subsurface electromagnetic and acoustic measurements.

The conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with a uniform Cartesian grid will result in a staircasing error, and wastes many unnecessary cells in regions with large structures in order to accommodate the accurate geometrical representation in regions with small structures. In this work, an explicit FDTD method with a nonuniform cylindrical grid is developed for time-domain Maxwell's equations. A refined lattice is used near sharp edges and within fine geometrical details, while a larger lattice is used outside these regions. This provides an efficient use of limited computer memory and computation time. The authors use two absorbing boundary conditions to a nonuniform cylindrical grid: (1) the straightforward extension of Berenger's perfectly matched layer (PML) which is no longer perfectly matched for cylindrical interfaces, thus the name quasi-PML, (QPML); (2) the improved true PML based on complex coordinates. In practice, both PML schemes can provide a satisfactory absorbing boundary condition.

In this paper, a general and accurate technique for nonsimulation performance evaluation of hybrid algorithms is presented. This technique gives full consideration to the important scenario dependence of the performance by using a scenario-conditional expectation of the performance. The system mode sequence is adopted as the essential description of the scenario. Two versions of the technique are given: mode-sequence-conditional, and current-mode-conditional. The first one is applied to the notable interacting multiple model algorithm and the second one to the popular probabilistic data association filter for tracking in clutter.

These events each occupy approximately 180/spl deg/ of crank angle. In conventional engine controllers, it is an accepted practice to sample the engine variables synchronously with these events (or submultiples of them). Such engine controllers are often called event-based systems. Unfortunately the main system noise (or disturbance) is also synchronous with the engine events: the engine pumping fluctuations. Since many electronic engine controllers are event sampled systems, the sampling frequency is thus also frequency locked to the main system disturbances. This creates a signal analysis problem which has, to the authors' knowledge, not been treated in detail in the literature. This paper concerns itself with the impact of this and related problems on accurate air/fuel ratio control of a spark ignition (SI) engine.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1994.752337","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 American Control Conference - ACC '94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 American Control Conference - ACC '94","pdfPath":"/iel4/5816/16245/00752337.pdf","startPage":"1585","endPage":"1587 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1994.752337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Problems in event based engine control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 June-1 July 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752337/","displayDocTitle":"Problems in event based engine control","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864585","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problems in event based engine control","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00752337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040187S","chronDate":"29 June-1 July 1994","isNumber":"16245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5816","citationCount":"30","articleId":"752337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":752364,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

For compliant suspensions, normal displacements of over 2 /spl mu/m for a comb bias of 30 V are observed. This phenomenon is due to electrostatic attraction induced on top of the suspended structure. By electrically lsolating alternating drive-comb fingers and applying voltages of equal magnitude and opposite sign, levitation force can be reduced by an order of magnitude, while reducing the lateral drive force by less than a factor of 2. The levitation theory incorporates electrostatic simulation results, and agrees well with experimental data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrostatic Comb Drive Levitation And Control Method","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.1992.752508","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/5481/00752508.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00752508.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.1992.752508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic Comb Drive Levitation And Control Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"December 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic Comb Drive Levitation And Control Method","sourcePdf":"00752508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099623S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"5481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"203","articleId":"752508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752511,"authors":[{"name":"F.

With adaptive arrays, the received signals at the antennas are combined to maximize signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) rather than only form a directed beam. Although more complex to implement, adaptive arrays have the advantage of higher diversity gain and antenna gain that is not limited by the scattering angle of the multipath at the mobile. Here, we use computer simulation to illustrate these advantages for range increase in both narrow-band and spread-spectrum mobile radio systems. For example, our results show that for a 3/spl deg/ scattering angle (typical in urban areas), a 100-element array base station can increase the range 2.8 and 5.5-fold with a phased array and an adaptive array, respectively. Also, for this scattering angle, the range increase of a phased array with 100 elements can be achieved by an adaptive array with only ten elements.","doi":"10.1109/25.752559","startPage":"353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/16249/00752559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.752559","endPage":"362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The range increase of adaptive versus phased arrays in mobile radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"The range increase of adaptive versus phased arrays in mobile radio systems","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6212347","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The range increase of adaptive versus phased arrays in mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00752559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060098S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","articleId":"752559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752561,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Joon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung Joon Lee","id":"37367720800"},{"name":"Hyeon Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyeon Woo Lee","id":"37336499300"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dan Keun Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"752561","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":84},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752561","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Interference","Gain","Sufficient conditions","Fading","Bit rate","3G mobile communication","Quality of service","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","channel capacity","radiofrequency interference","fading channels","multipath channels","cellular radio","land mobile radio","pseudonoise codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicode DS-CDMA systems","single-code DS-CDMA systems","multiclass services","capacities","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access systems","transmission rates","bit error rates","bit energy-to-interference power spectral density ratio","optimal received power","interference","variable processing gain","nonfading channels","multipath fading channels","dynamic multiple-cell environment"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with capacities of direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems accommodating multiclass services with different transmission rates and bit error rates (BER's).

The optimal received power is derived to cause the least interference to other signals while maintaining the acceptable bit energy-to-interference power spectral density ratio.

An analytical approach has been developed to compare these queuing techniques, and its results have been validated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/25.752568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/16249/00752568.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.752568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Different queuing policies for handover requests in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752568/","displayDocTitle":"Different queuing policies for handover requests in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6212356","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Different queuing policies for handover requests in low Earth orbit mobile satellite systems","sourcePdf":"00752568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03489S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","articleId":"752568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":752570,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37287470000"},{"name":"Jen-Tsung Hu","affiliation":["AT and T, USA"],"lastName":"Jen-Tsung Hu","id":"37366049900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"752570","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference suppression","Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Recurrent neural networks","Pipeline processing","Additive white noise","AWGN","Multiple access interference","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","recurrent neural nets","telecommunication computing","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","pipeline processing","computational complexity","AWGN channels","least mean squares methods","prediction theory","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrow-band interference suppression","spread-spectrum CDMA communications","pipelined recurrent neural networks","application","CDMA channels","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","nonGaussian observation noise","optimal detectors","receivers","computational complexity","nonlinear approximation","minimum mean-squared error nonlinear predictor model","adaptive learning","NBI signal","computational efficiency","simulation","signal-to-noise ratio","channel statistics"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the application of pipelined recurrent neural networks (PRNN's) to the narrow-band interference (NBI) suppression over spread-spectrum (SS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) channels in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) plus non-Gaussian observation noise. Optimal detectors and receivers for such channels are no longer linear. A PRNN that consists of a number of simpler small-scale recurrent neural network (RNN) modules with less computational complexity is conducted to introduce best nonlinear approximation capability into the minimum mean-squared error nonlinear predictor model in order to accurately predict the NBI signal based on adaptive learning for each module from previous non-Gaussian observations. Once the prediction of the NBI signal is obtained, a resulting signal is computed by subtracting the estimate from the received signal. Thus, the effect of the NBI can be reduced. Moreover, since those modules of a PRNN can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would lead to a significant improvement in its total computational efficiency. Simulation results show that PRNN-based NBI rejection provides a superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement relative to the conventional adaptive nonlinear approximate conditional mean (ACM) filters, especially when the channel statistics and exact number of CDMA users are not known to those receivers.","doi":"10.1109/25.752570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/16249/00752570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.752570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16249","startPage":"467","endPage":"477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA communications using pipelined recurrent neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA communications using pipelined recurrent neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6212358","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-band interference suppression in spread-spectrum CDMA communications using pipelined recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00752570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058906S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","articleId":"752570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752571,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The decision-feedback incorporated into the structure of a linear decorrelating detector is able to significantly improve the weaker users' performance by cancelling the MAI from the stronger users. However, the DDF receiver requires the knowledge of the received energies. In this paper, a new novel blind estimation mechanism is proposed to estimate all the users' energies using a stochastic approximation algorithm without training data. In order to increase the convergence speed of the energy estimation, a linear reinforcement learning technique is conducted to accelerate the stochastic approximation algorithms. Results show that our blind adaptation mechanism is able to accurately estimate all the users' energies even if the users of the DDF detector are not ranked properly. After performing the blind energy estimation and then reordering the users in a nonincreasing order, numerical simulations show that the DDF detector for the weakest user performs closely to the maximum likelihood detector, whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of users.","doi":"10.1109/25.752579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/16249/00752579.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.752579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive energy estimation for decorrelating decision-feedback CDMA multiuser detection using learning-type stochastic approximations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752579/","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive energy estimation for decorrelating decision-feedback CDMA multiuser detection using learning-type stochastic approximations","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6212367","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive energy estimation for decorrelating decision-feedback CDMA multiuser detection using learning-type stochastic approximations","sourcePdf":"00752579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03829S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","articleId":"752579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":752580,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Wan Sung","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi Wan Sung","id":"37265579100"},{"name":"Wing Shing Wong","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wing Shing Wong","id":"37276110200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"752580","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Quantization","Protection","Radio transmitters","Convergence","Time division multiple access","Interchannel interference","Distributed algorithms","Power system modeling","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","power control","telecommunication control","radio links","quantisation (signal)","convergence of numerical methods","feedback","cellular radio","fading","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed fixed-step power control algorithm","active link quality protection","high-capacity cellular communication system","feedback adjustment algorithm","channel allocation","convergence rate","step size","simulation","power quantization","short-term fading","carrier to interference ratio"]}],"abstract":"A distributed fixed-step power control algorithm is presented.

The mean signal power variation, cumulative distribution functions for the received signal envelopes, and corresponding power spectra are also given. Additional measurements were conducted to determine the power of the various reflected rays and their directions of arrival. A ray-tracing model considering reflections and diffractions is developed to represent LOS and NLOS suburban microcell propagation and assist in interpreting experimental results. Experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions obtained assuming smooth and rough building surfaces. LOS measurements have shown that the power in the received signal variation is primarily concentrated at low frequencies. High-frequency components, due to reflections from objects and surfaces opposite the base station, are present at a relatively low level. The value of the propagation exponent depends on the amplitude of reflections with respect to the direct path. The assumption of smooth reflecting surfaces overestimates the power associated with reflected components. However, the introduction of a surface roughness factor improves predictions. Reflections up to the second order are found to be adequate to represent microcell propagation. The contribution of diffraction to the signal envelope is negligible. NLOS results show a sharp drop in the mean signal level when the direct component is blocked. Coverage into the shadow region is limited to a few meters where single reflections keep arriving at the receive antenna.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6212371","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Experimental analysis of propagation at 62 GHz in suburban mobile radio microcells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental analysis of propagation at 62 GHz in suburban mobile radio microcells","sourcePdf":"00752583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042471S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","articleId":"752583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":752586,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Hong Huang","id":"37333609800"},{"name":"Liuchen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"lastName":"Liuchen Chang","id":"37278238600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"752586","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":851},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical two-speed propulsion by motor winding switching and its control strategies for electric vehicles","abstract":"Theoretical analyses and computer simulation studies lead the authors to propose: (1) a new electrical two-speed propulsion system for electric vehicles (EVs) by switching induction motor windings; and (2) an improved fuzzy logic control-continuous defuzzification method for the control of this system. The two-speed propulsion is achieved by connecting the motor stator windings in series for starting an EV and then switching the windings to parallel connection for normal speed operation. The method produces a high starting torque, yet maintains the inverter within its rated power range. As compared with star-delta starting of induction motors, the proposed series-parallel method offers higher starting torque and acceleration. The control strategies for this system are investigated. A comparison of fuzzy logic control with a conventional proportional-integral (PI) shows that a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) can be applied to EV propulsion systems. Simulation studies also demonstrate that an improved FLC method using a continuous defuzzification technique provides smoother torque and leads to lower harmonic components in motor currents, thus further enhancing this EV propulsion system.","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/16249/00752586.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.752586","doi":"10.1109/25.752586","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752586","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propulsion","Fuzzy logic","Torque","Control systems","Induction motors","Stator windings","Pi control","Proportional control","Computer simulation","Electric vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","electric propulsion","traction motors","switching","machine windings","electric machine analysis computing","machine theory","fuzzy control","two-term control","machine control","control system analysis computing","induction motors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-speed electric propulsion","induction motor winding switching","electric vehicles","control strategies","fuzzy logic control-continuous defuzzification method","motor stator windings","control design","starting torque","inverter","star-delta starting","acceleration","proportional-integral controller","control simulation","fuzzy logic controller","computer simulation","harmonic components","torque smoothing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Electrical two-speed propulsion by motor winding switching and its control strategies for electric vehicles","accessionNumber":"6212374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical two-speed propulsion by motor winding switching and its control strategies for electric vehicles","sourcePdf":"00752586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036142S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","articleId":"752586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":752588,"authors":[{"name":"A.-G.A.

It is already known that certain algorithms work well for the extraction of independent components. The present paper is concerned with superefficiency of these based on the statistical and dynamical analysis. In a statistical estimation using t examples, the covariance of any two extracted independent signals converges to 0 of the order of 1/t. On-line dynamics shows that the covariance is of the order of /spl eta/ when the learning rate /spl eta/ is fixed to a small constant. In contrast with the above general properties, a surprising superefficiency holds in blind source separation under certain conditions where superefficiency implies that covariance decreases in the order of 1/t/sup 2/ or of /spl eta//sup 2/. The paper uses the natural gradient learning algorithm and method of estimating functions to obtain superefficient procedures for both batch estimation and on-line learning.

This is accomplished by recognizing that an important class of adapted pattern modification techniques are realized by the application of a conformal matrix \"taper\" to the original sample covariance matrix. From the Schur product theorem for positive (semi) definite matrices and Kolmogorov's existence theorem, we further establish that CMTs are, in fact, the solution to a minimum variance optimum beamformer associated with an auxiliary stochastic process that is related to the original by a Hadamard (Schur) product. This allows us to gain deeper insight into the design of both existing pattern modification techniques and new CMTs that can, for example, simultaneously address several different design constraints such as pattern distortion due to insufficient sample support and weights mismatch due to nonstationary interference. A new two-dimensional (2-D) CMT for space-time adaptive radar applications designed to provide more robust clutter cancellation is also introduced. Since the CMT approach only involves a single matrix Haddamard product, it is also inherently low complexity. The practical utility of the CMT approach is illustrated through its application to both spatial and spatio-temporal adaptive beamforming examples.","doi":"10.1109/78.752596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16250/00752596.pdf","startPage":"977","endPage":"985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.752596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and application of covariance matrix tapers for robust adaptive beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752596/","displayDocTitle":"Theory and application of covariance matrix tapers for robust adaptive beamforming","volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6218767","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and application of covariance matrix tapers for robust adaptive beamforming","sourcePdf":"00752596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031934S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"208","articleId":"752596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752597,"authors":[{"name":"P.N.

However, complex wavelet bases offer a number of potential advantageous properties. For example, it has been suggested that the complex Daubechies wavelet can be made symmetric. However, these papers always imply that if the complex basis has a symmetry property, then it must exhibit linear phase as well. In this paper, we prove that a linear-phase complex orthogonal wavelet does not exist. We study the implications of symmetry and linear phase for both complex and real-valued orthogonal wavelet bases. As a byproduct, we propose a method to obtain a complex orthogonal wavelet basis having the symmetry property and approximately linear phase. The numerical analysis of the phase response of various complex and real Daubechies wavelets is given. Both real and complex-symmetric orthogonal wavelet can only have symmetric amplitude spectra. It is often desired to have asymmetric amplitude spectra for processing general complex signals. Therefore, we propose a method to design general complex orthogonal perfect reconstruct filter banks (PRFBs) by a parameterization scheme. Design examples are given. It is shown that the amplitude spectra of the general complex conjugate quadrature filters (CQFs) can be asymmetric with respect the zero frequency. This method can be used to choose optimal complex orthogonal wavelet basis for processing complex signals such as in radar and sonar.","doi":"10.1109/78.752601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1039","endPage":"1048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16250/00752601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.752601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal complex filter banks and wavelets: some properties and design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel bank filters","Filter bank","Continuous wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","Signal processing","Radar signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Wavelet transforms","Band pass filters","Gabor filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","filtering theory","wavelet transforms","spectral analysis","signal reconstruction","sonar signal processing","radar signal processing","linear phase filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal complex filter banks","real-valued wavelet bases","complex wavelet bases","complex Daubechies wavelet","symmetry property","linear-phase complex orthogonal wavelet","real-valued orthogonal wavelet bases","numerical analysis","phase response","symmetric amplitude spectra","perfect reconstruct filter banks","complex conjugate quadrature filters","zero frequency","sonar","radar","complex signals processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal complex filter banks and wavelets: some properties and design","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6218772","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752601/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal complex filter banks and wavelets: some properties and design","sourcePdf":"00752601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03913S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","articleId":"752601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752604,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Usually, the RS algorithm is used for error detection and correction of samples in finite fields. For the case of missing samples of a speech signal, we work with samples in the field of real or complex numbers, and we can use FFT or some new transforms in the reconstruction algorithm. DSP implementation and simulation results show that the proposed methods are better than the ones previously published in terms of the quality of recovered speech signal for a given complexity. The burst error recovery method using the FFT kernel is sensitive to quantization and additive noise like the other techniques. However, other proposed transform kernels are very robust in correcting bursts of errors with the presence of quantization and additive noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16250/00752604.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.752604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.752604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient algorithms for burst error recovery using FFT and other transform kernels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconstruction algorithms","Error correction","Speech","Kernel","Quantization","Additive noise","Signal reconstruction","Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error detection codes","speech coding","signal reconstruction","speech intelligibility","Reed-Solomon codes","fast Fourier transforms","transform coding","signal sampling","quantisation (signal)","noise","decoding","conjugate gradient methods","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst error recovery","FFT","transform kernels","efficient algorithms","signal reconstruction","missing samples","reconstruction algorithms","Reed-Solomon decoding techniques","RS algorithm","error correction","error detection","finite fields","speech signal quality","real numbers","complex numbers","DSP implementation","simulation results","complexity","quantization noise","additive noise","conjugate gradient technique","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Efficient algorithms for burst error recovery using FFT and other transform kernels","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6218775","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient algorithms for burst error recovery using FFT and other transform kernels","sourcePdf":"00752604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048032S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"65","articleId":"752604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":752608,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The idea of the method is to localize the nonregularities peculiar to fast algorithms for other trigonometric transforms into the nodes of the Cooley-Tukey FFT type computational graph.

An estimator based on the Huber objective function behaves as an L/sub 1/ norm estimator for large residual errors and as an L/sub 2/ norm estimator for small residual errors.

A C++ program that implements this algorithm has been included.","doi":"10.1109/78.752621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.752621","endPage":"1184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16250/00752621.pdf","startPage":"1181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radix-2 decimation-in-frequency algorithm for the computation of the real-valued FFT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752621/","displayDocTitle":"Radix-2 decimation-in-frequency algorithm for the computation of the real-valued FFT","volume":"47","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6218792","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radix-2 decimation-in-frequency algorithm for the computation of the real-valued FFT","sourcePdf":"00752621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031109S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","articleId":"752621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752646,"authors":[{"name":"Shigang Chen","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, US"],"lastName":"Shigang Chen","id":"37277597200"},{"name":"K.

The requirement for timely delivery of digitized audio-visual information raises new challenges for next-generation integrated services broadband networks. One of the key issues is QoS routing. It selects network routes with sufficient resources for the requested QoS parameters. The goal of routing solutions is twofold: (1) satisfying the QoS requirements for every admitted connection, and (2) achieving global efficiency in resource utilization. Many unicast/multicast QoS routing algorithms have been published, and they work with a variety of QoS requirements and resource constraints. Overall, they can be partitioned into three broad classes: (1) source routing, (2) distributed routing, and (3) hierarchical routing algorithms. We give an overview of the QoS routing problem as well as the existing solutions. We present the strengths and weaknesses of different routing strategies, and outline the challenges. We also discuss the basic algorithms in each class, classify and compare them, and point out possible future directions in the QoS routing area.","doi":"10.1109/65.752646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","startPage":"64","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel4/65/16253/00752646.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.752646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of quality of service routing for next-generation high-speed networks: problems and solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Routing","Partitioning algorithms","Multicast algorithms","High-speed networks","Multimedia communication","Next generation networking","Intserv networks","Broadband communication","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","B-ISDN","telecommunication network routing","reviews","distributed processing","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gigabit-per-second high-speed networks","next-generation high-speed networks","real-time multimedia applications","digital audio-visual information","integrated services broadband networks","global efficiency","resource utilization","unicast/multicast QoS routing algorithms","source routing","distributed routing","hierarchical routing","quality of service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1998","displayDocTitle":"An overview of quality of service routing for next-generation high-speed networks: problems and solutions","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6213007","publicationDate":"November/December 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752646/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of quality of service routing for next-generation high-speed networks: problems and solutions","sourcePdf":"00752646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04661S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1998","isNumber":"16253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"480","articleId":"752646","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752651,"authors":[{"name":"Jih-Kwon Peir","affiliation":["Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jih-Kwon Peir","id":"37294178300"},{"name":"W.W.

This design results in a prefetching system that provides good coverage, is accurate, and produces timely results that can be effectively used by the processor. We also explored a range of techniques that can be used to reduce the bandwidth demands of prefetching, leading to improved memory system performance.

Padding is a data alignment technique that involves the insertion of dummy elements into a data structure for improving cache performance. In this work, we present DAT, a technique that augments loop tiling with data alignment, achieving improved efficiency (by ensuring that the cache is never under-utilized) as well as improved flexibility (by eliminating self-interference cache conflicts independent of the tile size). This results in a more stable and better cache performance than existing approaches, in addition to maximizing cache utilization, eliminating self-interference, and minimizing cross-interference conflicts. Further, while all previous efforts are targeted at programs characterized by the reuse of a single array, we also address the issue of minimizing conflict misses when several tiled arrays are involved. To validate our technique, we ran extensive experiments using both simulations as well as actual measurements on SUN Sparc5 and Sparc10 workstations. The results on benchmarks exhibiting varying memory access patterns demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through consistently high hit ratios and improved performance across varying problem sizes.","doi":"10.1109/12.752655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/16254/00752655.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.752655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmenting loop tiling with data alignment for improved cache performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752655/","displayDocTitle":"Augmenting loop tiling with data alignment for improved cache performance","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6229715","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmenting loop tiling with data alignment for improved cache performance","sourcePdf":"00752655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032234S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"69","articleId":"752655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752657,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such networks violate the constraint of pairwise in-order message delivery implicitly required by many existing directory-based cache coherence protocols. To solve this problem, two alternative strategies are currently used by computer architects. The first strategy, used in the SGI Origin series, is to employ an intelligent cache coherence protocol which detects and resolves all race conditions caused by out-of-order (OoO) events. The second strategy, used in the HAL Mercury series, is to use a sophisticated network interface (NI) which detects and remedies every OoO event before the messages are fed to the cache coherence controllers. Both strategies involve complicated hardware logic, either at the cache coherence controller level or at the NI level. In this paper, we propose a new strategy that uses block correlated FIFO channels. This new strategy detects all potential race conditions and prevents them from occurring. It allows the use of a simple cache coherence protocol and an inexpensive NI. We also present an efficient implementation of this strategy based on current technology. Detailed simulations are performed using benchmark applications to evaluate the performance of our new strategy. The results indicate that, compared to the existing strategies, our new strategy always provides either the best or close to the best overall performance. This study also provides valuable insights into the design trade-offs in incorporating modern networks into DSM systems.","doi":"10.1109/12.752665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16254","startPage":"236","endPage":"244","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/16254/00752665.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.752665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the benefits of multiple-path network in DSM systems: architectural alternatives and performance evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Network interfaces","Out of order","Computer Society","Event detection","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Access protocols","Coherence","Delay","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hazards and race conditions","memory protocols","distributed shared memory systems","parallel architectures","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-path network","scalable distributed shared-memory systems","multiple paths","SGI Origin series","intelligent cache coherence protocol","race conditions","HAL Mercury series","network interface","complicated hardware logic","block correlated FIFO channels","simulations","benchmark applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the benefits of multiple-path network in DSM systems: architectural alternatives and performance evaluation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6212311","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the benefits of multiple-path network in DSM systems: architectural alternatives and performance evaluation","sourcePdf":"00752665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043796S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"3","articleId":"752665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":752780,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.-Y.

In HPF, the array distribution may involve alignment and cyclic(k)-distribution such that the enumeration of the local set and the enumeration of the communication set exhibit regular patterns which can be modeled as integer lattices. In the special case of unit-strided alignment, many techniques of the communication set enumeration have been proposed, while in the general case of the non-unit-strided alignment, inspector-like run-time codes are needed to build repeating pattern table or to scan over local elements such that the communication set can be constructed. Unlike other works on this problem of the general alignment and cyclic(k) distribution, our approach derives an algebraic solution for such an integer lattice that models the communication set by using the Smith-Normal-Form analysis, therefore, efficient enumeration of the communication set can be generated.

However, designing a practical, low complexity scheduling algorithm without sacrificing performance remains a challenging problem. A variety of heuristics have been proposed to generate efficient solutions but they take prohibitively long execution times for moderate size or large problems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called FASTEST (Fast Assignment and Scheduling of Tasks using an Efficient Search Technique) that has O(e) time complexity, where e is the number of edges in the task graph. The algorithm first generates an initial solution in a short time and then refines it by using a simple but robust random neighborhood search. We have also parallelized the search to further lower the time complexity. We are using the algorithm in a prototype automatic parallelization and scheduling tool which compiles sequential code and generates parallel code optimized with judicious scheduling. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with several application programs and outperforms a number of previous algorithms by generating parallelized code with shorter execution times, while taking dramatically shorter scheduling times. The FASTEST algorithm generates optimal solutions for a majority of the test cases and close-to-optimal solutions for the rest.","doi":"10.1109/71.752781","startPage":"147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/16259/00752781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.752781","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FASTEST: a practical low-complexity algorithm for compile-time assignment of parallel programs to multiprocessors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"FASTEST: a practical low-complexity algorithm for compile-time assignment of parallel programs to multiprocessors","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6207475","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FASTEST: a practical low-complexity algorithm for compile-time assignment of parallel programs to multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"00752781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048657S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"24","articleId":"752781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":752782,"authors":[{"name":"L.

As parallelizable loops arise frequently in practice, we advocate a novel framework for their identification: speculatively execute the loop as a doall and apply a fully parallel data dependence test to determine if it had any cross-iteration dependences; if the test fails, then the loop is reexecuted serially. Since, from our experience, a significant amount of the available parallelism in Fortran programs can be exploited by loops transformed through privatization and reduction parallelization, our methods can speculatively apply these transformations and then check their validity at run-time. Another important contribution of this paper is a novel method for reduction recognition which goes beyond syntactic pattern matching: it detects at run-time if the values stored in an array participate in a reduction operation, even if they are transferred through private variables and/or are affected by statically unpredictable control flow. We present experimental results on loops from the PERFECT Benchmarks, which substantiate our claim that these techniques can yield significant speedups which are often superior to those obtainable by inspector/executor methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Runtime","Privatization","Parallel processing","Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer science","Pattern recognition","Pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallelising compilers","parallel processing","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LRPD test","speculative run-time parallelization of loops","privatization","reduction parallelization","parallelizing compilers","parallelizable loops","fully parallel data dependence test","Fortran programs","syntactic pattern matching","PERFECT Benchmarks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/71.752782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/16259/00752782.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.752782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The LRPD test: speculative run-time parallelization of loops with privatization and reduction parallelization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The LRPD test: speculative run-time parallelization of loops with privatization and reduction parallelization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752782/","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6207476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The LRPD test: speculative run-time parallelization of loops with privatization and reduction parallelization","sourcePdf":"00752782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048937S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"126","articleId":"752782","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":752787,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Link adaptation is necessary in order to match the data rate to time-varying channel and interference conditions. We present a robust radio link protocol (RLP) based on the concept of incremental redundancy (IR). Here, redundant data, for the purpose of error correction, is transmitted only when previously transmitted packets of information are received and acknowledged to be in error. The redundant packet is combined with the previously received (errored) information packets in order to facilitate error correction decoding. If there is a decoding failure, more redundancy is transmitted. It is shown here that an RLP built using the IR concept is more robust and has better throughput than link adaptation schemes using explicit channel measurements such as instantaneous or average signal-to-noise or signal-to-interference ratio. We study the performance of an implementation of a IR-based RLP for EDGE (enhanced data services for GSM evolution) data and demonstrate its superior throughput and robustness properties. The penalty paid for increased robustness and higher throughput is additional receiver memory and higher delay. IR based RLP has already been standardized for IS-136+ packet data and is being actively considered for EDGE standardization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive radio link protocol with enhanced data rates for GSM evolution","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/98.752788","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/16258/00752788.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.752788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752788","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive radio link protocol with enhanced data rates for GSM evolution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6210353","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive radio link protocol with enhanced data rates for GSM evolution","sourcePdf":"00752788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038877S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"41","articleId":"752788","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752789,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy logic controller (NFLC) where all of its parameters can be tuned simultaneously by GA. The structure of the controller is based on the radial basis function neural network (RBF) with Gaussian membership functions. The NFLC tuned by GA can somewhat eliminate laborious design steps such as manual tuning of the membership functions and selection of the fuzzy rules. The GA implementation incorporates dynamic crossover and mutation probabilistic rates for faster convergence. A flexible position coding strategy of the NFLC parameters is also implemented to obtain near optimal solutions. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with a conventional fuzzy controller and a PID controller tuned by GA. Simulation results show that the proposed controller offers encouraging advantages and has better performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning of a neuro-fuzzy controller by genetic algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.752795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/16256/00752795.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.752795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Tuning of a neuro-fuzzy controller by genetic algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6211033","pubMedId":"18252294","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning of a neuro-fuzzy controller by genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00752795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048641S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"164","articleId":"752795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752797,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

A novel computationally efficient single layer functional link ANN (FLANN) is proposed for this purpose. This network has a simple structure in which the nonlinearity is introduced by functional expansion of the input pattern by trigonometric polynomials. Because of input pattern enhancement, the FLANN is capable of forming arbitrarily nonlinear decision boundaries and can perform complex pattern classification tasks. Considering channel equalization as a nonlinear classification problem, the FLANN has been utilized for nonlinear channel equalization. The performance of the FLANN is compared with two other ANN structures [a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a polynomial perceptron network (PPN)] along with a conventional linear LMS-based equalizer for different linear and nonlinear channel models. The effect of eigenvalue ratio (EVR) of input correlation matrix on the equalizer performance has been studied. The comparison of computational complexity involved for the three ANN structures is also provided.","doi":"10.1109/3477.752798","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","startPage":"262","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/16256/00752798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.752798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear channel equalization for QAM signal constellation using artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Artificial neural networks","Polynomials","Multilayer perceptrons","Adaptive systems","Adaptive equalizers","Digital communication","Quadrature phase shift keying","Pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","neural nets","quadrature amplitude modulation","pattern classification","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","adaptive channel equalization","4-QAM","signal constellation","multilayer perceptron","FLANN","functional link ANN","eigenvalue ratio","input correlation matrix","equalizer performance","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear channel equalization for QAM signal constellation using artificial neural networks","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6211035","pubMedId":"18252297","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752798/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear channel equalization for QAM signal constellation using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00752798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040365S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"121","articleId":"752798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752799,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The creation of the sorted sequence is progressive, whereby at most as many network updates are required as there are elements in the sequence. Ties between elements are resolved by simultaneous activation of the corresponding nodes. Finally, the min and max problems are solved in a single network update.","doi":"10.1109/3477.752799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/16256/00752799.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.752799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16256","startPage":"271","endPage":"275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel artificial neural network for sorting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel artificial neural network for sorting","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6211036","pubMedId":"18252298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel artificial neural network for sorting","sourcePdf":"00752799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110052S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"14","articleId":"752799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":752800,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Qing Wei","affiliation":["Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Guo-Qing Wei","id":"37087485021"},{"name":"G.

This involves many computations and even some difficulties, especially when different kinds of sensors are involved. In this correspondence, we present a neural network approach to the motion determination problem without any calibration. Two kinds of sensory data, namely, camera images and laser range data, are used as the input to a multilayer feedforward network to associate the direct transformation from the sensory data to the required motions. This provides a practical sensor fusion method. Using a recursive motion strategy and in terms of a network correction, we relax the requirement for the exactness of the learned transformation. Another important feature of our work is that the goal position can be changed without having to do network retraining. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","doi":"10.1109/3477.752800","startPage":"276","endPage":"280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.752800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel4/3477/16256/00752800.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensory visual servoing by a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752800/","displayDocTitle":"Multisensory visual servoing by a neural network","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6211037","pubMedId":"18252299","publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensory visual servoing by a neural network","sourcePdf":"00752800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047637S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"5","articleId":"752800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":752807,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.C.

An automatic request (ARQ) protocol is described that allows the soft decision decoders to outperform their hard decision counterparts in both reliability and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/26.752809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16255/00752809.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Hamming and BCH soft decision decoders for mobile data applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Extended Hamming and BCH soft decision decoders for mobile data applications","volume":"47","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217497","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Hamming and BCH soft decision decoders for mobile data applications","sourcePdf":"00752809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041913S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","articleId":"752809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752810,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

When the sounding pulse becomes a chirp-type waveform, the two approaches become similar. Simple rectangular pulses can be used for partial, but usually sufficient, channel characterization. In this paper, the process is described for resolving impulse response components into bins smaller than the duration of the sounding pulse and smaller than the reciprocal of the channel bandwidth. From such \"super-resolution\", the delay spread of the propagation channel can be established accurately even when it is much less than the sounding pulse duration, allowing longer, higher energy pulses to be used for channel characterization. The process is demonstrated using subtractive deconvolution where a loop gain of unity is shown to be stable; and a modified inverse filter technique, in which the modification caters for the spectral zeros of the sounding pulse.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16255/00752811.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.752811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-resolution of pulsed multipath channels for delay spread characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Pulse measurements","Frequency measurement","Transfer functions","Chirp","Bandwidth","Propagation delay","Acoustic propagation","Deconvolution","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","transient response","signal resolution","deconvolution","spectral analysis","transfer functions","delays","filtering theory","radiowave propagation","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay spread characterization","pulsed multipath channels","super-resolution","frequency selective channels","continuous wave frequency sweep","transfer function","channel sounding","impulse response","subtractive deconvolution","chirp-type waveform","rectangular pulses","channel characterization","channel bandwidth","radio propagation channel","sounding pulse duration","unity loop gain","modified inverse filter","spectral zeros","antenna diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Super-resolution of pulsed multipath channels for delay spread characterization","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217499","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-resolution of pulsed multipath channels for delay spread characterization","sourcePdf":"00752811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0488S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","articleId":"752811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752812,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Starting with the case of two bit streams, we consider two classes of UEP schemes: time-division coded modulation (TDCM) and superposition coded modulation (SCM). The early result of Bergmanns and Cover (1974) ensures the asymptotic superiority of SCM. However, accounting for the fact that practical channel codes do not achieve capacity, we show that the validity of this result depends on the prescribed degree of inequality in protection of the streams. To complement the straightforward design and use of TDCM schemes, we propose methods to decode and design SCM schemes. The design examples substantiate the conclusions obtained from performance analysis. We extend the results to the case of UEP of multiple (more than two) bit streams, where a hybrid of SCM and TDCM must also be considered. We show that, for a large range of unequal protection levels, the hybrid scheme outperforms both SCM and TDCM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217505","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Time-division versus superposition coded modulation schemes for unequal error protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-division versus superposition coded modulation schemes for unequal error protection","sourcePdf":"00752817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026672S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","articleId":"752817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":752818,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Compared to the conventional CDMA using orthogonal codes, this scheme allows reduction in receiver complexity by lowering the modulation level for the second-stage orthogonal modulation. The staggered (half-chip) quadrature direct-sequence signaling is adopted to uniformly distribute the transmit power and allow noncoherent detection at the receiver because carrier phase tracking is not feasible because of the binary PPM, suitable for the reverse link in cellular networks. Statistics of inter-user interferences are characterized, and then derive the symbol error probability for the proposed M-ary modulation format.

In fact, if the observed window does not cover the entire data sequence, the classical asynchronous decorrelating detector is no longer near-far resistant.

In this scheme, each terminal can send its packet randomly at any one of N/sub w/, possible time instants, equally spaced over one period of direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals. Such transmissions initiated at different time instants can be resolved because of the high time resolution of wide-band signals if the channel delays associated with multipath are small due to limited transmission range. Quasi-synchronous distributed networks are considered to allow timing drift among terminals and also reflect wireless multiple-access channels, in which common-transmitter-based (C-T) and receiver-transmitter-based (R-T) spreading code assignments are adopted to permit a contention mode only for the header portion. The throughput is evaluated under the spread ALOHA assumption on collision events and also by reflecting the effect of the MAI in the header detection process. Theoretical results show that the combination of the SA scheme with C-T assignment results in more significant improvement than the case of R-T assignment, and also the former provides the benefit of the efficient usage of spreading codes in a code-limited environment.","doi":"10.1109/26.752826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16255/00752826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16255","startPage":"454","endPage":"463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of slotted asynchronous CDMA using controlled time of arrival","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of slotted asynchronous CDMA using controlled time of arrival","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217514","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of slotted asynchronous CDMA using controlled time of arrival","sourcePdf":"00752826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029624S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"752826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":752827,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

Hence, the results show that MC-CDMA systems are attractive candidates for future CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/26.752827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/16255/00752827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.752827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16255","startPage":"464","endPage":"471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive signal reception for MC-CDMA systems in Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive signal reception for MC-CDMA systems in Rayleigh fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6217515","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive signal reception for MC-CDMA systems in Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00752827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04309S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","articleId":"752827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":752905,"authors":[{"name":"O.Y.

Error robustness is achieved by using biorthogonal wavelet subband image coding with multistage gain-shape vector quantization (MS-GS VQ) which uses three stages of signal decomposition in an attempt to reduce the effect of transmission bit errors by distributing image information among many blocks. Good visual quality of the reconstructed images is obtained by applying genetic algorithms (GAs) to codebook generation to produce reconstruction capabilities that are superior to the conventional techniques. The proposed decomposition scheme also supports the use of GAs because decomposition reduces the problem size. Some simulations for evaluating the performance of the proposed coding scheme on both transmission bit errors and distortions of the reconstructed images are performed. Simulation results show that the proposed MS-GS VQ with good codebooks designed by GAs provides not only better robustness to transmission bit errors but also higher peak signal-to-noise ratio even under high bit error rate conditions.","doi":"10.1109/4235.752919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4235.752919","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel4/4235/16264/00752919.pdf","startPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MS-GS VQ codebook design for wireless image communication using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752919/","displayDocTitle":"A MS-GS VQ codebook design for wireless image communication using genetic algorithms","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6217038","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MS-GS VQ codebook design for wireless image communication using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00752919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039779S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"4","articleId":"752919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":752920,"authors":[{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Changsha Institute of Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Qingfu Zhang","id":"37364631900"},{"name":"Yiu-Wing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yiu-Wing Leung","id":"37271603500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"752920","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":177,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":770},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752920","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Routing","Multicast algorithms","Delay","Communication networks","Heuristic algorithms","Multimedia communication","Costs","Videoconference","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","telecommunication network routing","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","multicast communication","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal genetic algorithm","multimedia multicast routing","multicast tree","NP-complete problem"]}],"abstract":"Many multimedia communication applications require a source to send multimedia information to multiple destinations through a communication network.

This problem is known as multimedia multicast routing and has been proved to be NP-complete. The paper proposes an orthogonal genetic algorithm for multimedia multicast routing. Its salient feature is to incorporate an experimental design method called orthogonal design into the crossover operation. As a result, it can search the solution space in a statistically sound manner and it is well suited for parallel implementation and execution.

Given that successful electrical performance requires careful control of the lowest-level geometric features-wire bends, precise length, planarity, etc., we suggest a new layout strategy for these circuits: early floorplanning at the device level. This paper develops a floorplanner for radio-frequency circuits based on a genetic algorithm (GA) that supports fully simultaneous placement and routing. The GA evolves slicing-style floorplans comprising devices and planned areas for wire meanders. Each floorplan candidate is fully routed with a gridless, detailed maze-router which can dynamically resize the floorplan as necessary. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of this approach to successfully optimize for wire planarity, realize multiple constraints on net lengths or phases, and achieve reasonable area in modest CPU times.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6210431","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Device-level early floorplanning algorithms for RF circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-level early floorplanning algorithms for RF circuits","sourcePdf":"00752922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06095S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"752922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":752926,"authors":[{"name":"S.

While PROP's gain function has a greater futuristic component than PM or LA, it incorporates spatially local information-only information on the removal probabilities of adjacent nets of a cell is used in its gain computation. This prevents a higher-level view of nonlocal structures. Also, giving uniform weights to all nets, results in an inability to differentiate between the futuristic benefit of removing one net from another. This paper investigates for the first time the issues of using nonlocal structural information in gain functions and variable net weights based on the futuristic (stochastic) benefit of moving them from the cutset. The result is a more sophisticated partitioner DEEP-PROP that performs better for circuits with large complexities by incorporating more nonlocal (second order) structural information than PROP. The second-order information is incorporated into cell gains as well as variable net weights-the latter helps to focus future cell moves in the \"right\" cluster around the currently moved cell and, thus, better utilizes the information that led to its selection as the best move. A lower complexity version, variable weight PROP (VAR-PROP), that also uses dynamically assigned variable net weights, but based on first-order information, has also been developed. Both versions yield significant improvements over PROP on the ACM/SIGDA benchmark suite. DEEP-PROP yields mincut improvements of as much as 39% and an average of 20% for large circuits (10-K to 25-K cells) and an average of 14% over all circuits. DEEP PROP is about a factor of 2.8 times slower than PROP, which is very fast. VAR-PROP, which has a much lower computational complexity than DEEP-PROP, yields for large circuits, maximum and average mincut improvements over PROP of 27% and 18%, respectively, and an average of 12.6% improvement over all circuits. It is only about 14% slower than PROP, For the only very large circuit golem3 in the suite (>100 K cells), the improvements produced by DEEP-PROP and VAR-PROP over PROP are 15.6% and 11.5%, respectively. We also compare DEEP-PROP to FM, PROP and hMetis for a subset of the newer 1SPD98 benchmark circuits, and demonstrate significant improvements over FM and PROP, and comparable mincuts (within 2%) to hMetis, one of the best multilevel partitioners.","doi":"10.1109/43.752926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/16262/00752926.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.752926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partitioning using second-order information and stochastic-gain functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752926/","displayDocTitle":"Partitioning using second-order information and stochastic-gain functions","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6216374","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partitioning using second-order information and stochastic-gain functions","sourcePdf":"00752926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035011S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","articleId":"752926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":752932,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this study, an electronic nose with an array of 32 sensors was used to classify a range of odorous substances. The collective time response of the sensor array was first partitioned into four time segments, using four smooth time windowing functions. The dimension of the data associated with each time segment as then reduced by applying the Karhunen-Loeve (truncated) expansion (KLE). An ensemble of the reduced data patterns was then used to train a neural network (NN) using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning method. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based evolutionary computation method was used to devise the appropriate NN training parameters, as well as the effective database partitions/features. Finally, it was shown that a GA supervised NN system (GANN) outperforms the NN-only classifier, for the classes of the odorants investigated in this study (fragrances, hog farm air, and soft beverages).","doi":"10.1109/10.752940","startPage":"429","endPage":"439","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16261/00752940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.752940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using neural networks and genetic algorithms to enhance performance in an electronic nose","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Intelligent networks","Electronic noses","Sensor arrays","Artificial intelligence","Biomedical signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Gas detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","genetic algorithms","chemioception","biomedical electronics","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic nose performance enhancement","odorous substances classification","Karhunen-Loeve truncated expansion","reduced data patterns ensemble","Levenberg-Marquardt learning method","neural network training","fragrances","hog farm air","aroma","soft beverages","evolutionary computation method","training parameters","database partitions"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Evolution","Models, Biological","Neural Networks (Computer)","Odors","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Random Allocation","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Smell","Software Design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks and genetic algorithms to enhance performance in an electronic nose","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6217453","pubMedId":"10217881","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks and genetic algorithms to enhance performance in an electronic nose","sourcePdf":"00752940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047731S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"61","articleId":"752940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":752943,"authors":[{"name":"C.Q.

Nucleus cochlear implants short all stimulating electrodes between pulses in order to achieve charge balance, resulting in a small residual direct current (DC). In the present study the authors sought to characterize the variation of this residual DC with different charge recovery mechanisms, stimulation modes, and stimulation parameters, and by modeling, to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms. In an acute study with anaesthetised guinea pigs, DC was measured in four platinum intracochlear electrodes stimulated using a Nucleus(R) CI24M cochlear implant at moderate to high pulse rates (1200-14 500 pulses/s) and stimulus intensities (0.2-1.75 mA at 26-200 /spl mu/s/phase). Both monopolar and bipolar stimulation modes were used, and the effects of shorting or combining a capacitor with shorting for charge recovery were investigated. Residual DC increased as a function of stimulus rate, stimulus intensity, and pulse width. DC was lower for monopolar than bipolar stimulation, and lower still with capacitively coupled monopolar stimulation. The authors' model suggests that residual DC is a consequence of Faradaic reactions which allow charge to leak through the electrode tissue interface. Such reactions and charge leakage are still present when capacitors are used to achieve charge recovery, but anodic and cathodic reactions are balanced in such a way that the net charge leakage is zero.","doi":"10.1109/10.752943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16261/00752943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.752943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16261","startPage":"461","endPage":"469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve: direct current measurement in vivo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve: direct current measurement in vivo","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6217456","pubMedId":"10217884","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve: direct current measurement in vivo","sourcePdf":"00752943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034955S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"94","articleId":"752943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":752949,"authors":[{"name":"Yoke Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Yoke Wang","id":"37281432300"},{"name":"M.N.S.

The address generating circuit that permits the in-place implementation is simple and the same for all the local memories.

This is achieved by external magnetic field biasing coupled with the inherent magnetization of the ferrite substrate. Measurements and analytical studies based on the method of moments (MoM) have verified these attractive properties of ferrite substrates. However, verification of the analysis is difficult and, furthermore, previous models have relied on uniform biasing across the substrate. We present a hybrid finite element-boundary integral (FE-BI) method, which permits modeling of the true nonuniform bias fields within the substrate for a more accurate prediction of the ferrite patch performance. After validation of the proposed simulation and a demonstration of the inherent properties of the ferrite patch, it is shown that nonuniform biasing is responsible for additional frequency shifts. We also identify the poor condition of the resulting matrix systems and relate this situation to the predictable occurrence of nonpropagating substrate modes. A more robust iterative solver with preconditioning is, therefore, proposed and applied to handle these situations.","doi":"10.1109/8.752980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16263/00752980.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.752980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch antennas on ferromagnetic substrates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752980/","displayDocTitle":"Patch antennas on ferromagnetic substrates","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6222885","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch antennas on ferromagnetic substrates","sourcePdf":"00752980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046045S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"65","articleId":"752980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":752988,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

It shows that the exponent of the power law varies widely among the results from the different sites. Possible explanations of this are: (1) the frequency dependence of scintillation due to cloudy turbulence is different from that due to clear-sky turbulence and this kind of scintillation may be present to different extents in the various databases due to climatic differences and different clear-sky selection procedures or (2) angle-of-arrival fluctuations due to turbulence have a different frequency dependence and this effect may have some impact on the measured scintillation at some of the sites.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency dependence","Predictive models","Frequency measurement","Fluctuations","Electromagnetic propagation","Humidity","Refractive index","Electromagnetic scattering","Degradation","Rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","microwave propagation","millimetre wave propagation","satellite links","scintillation","atmospheric turbulence","clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude scintillation","frequency dependence","prediction models","tropospheric scintillation","Earth-satellite paths","ITU-R","power law exponent","measurement results","satellite links","Europe","Japan","USA","elevation angles","cloudy turbulence","clear-sky turbulence","databases","climatic differences","clear-sky selection procedures","angle-of-arrival fluctuations","measured scintillation","SHF","EHF","Karasawa","Yamada","Allnutt","4 to 50 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/8.752997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16263/00752997.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.752997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency dependence of amplitude scintillation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=752997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency dependence of amplitude scintillation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/752997/","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6222892","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency dependence of amplitude scintillation","sourcePdf":"00752997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030308S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","articleId":"752997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":753001,"authors":[{"name":"L.S.

For a triangular element, this paper proposes a class of hierarchical TVPEs that differ from traditional TVFEs. The hierarchical nature of the proposed TVFEs makes them ideally suited for employing an efficient selective field expansion (the lowest order TVFE employed within part of the computational domain and a higher order TVFE employed within the remaining part of the computational domain). This is an attractive feature not shared by nonhierarchical TVFEs for which a more traditional approach (the same TVFE employed throughout the computational domain) must be applied. For determining the scattering by composite cylinders, this paper argues that the performance (in terms of accuracy, memory, and, in most cases, CPU time) of the proposed class of hierarchical TVFEs when applying selective field expansion is superior to that of the lowest order TVFE and a traditional nonhierarchical TVFE. This is the case when an artificial absorber as well as a boundary integral is used for truncating the computational domain. A guideline is given as to how lowest and higher order TVFEs shall be combined for optimal performance of the proposed class of hierarchical TVFEs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and application of a novel class of hierarchical tangential vector finite elements for electromagnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.753001","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/16263/00753001.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.753001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1999","displayDocTitle":"Development and application of a novel class of hierarchical tangential vector finite elements for electromagnetics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1999","accessionNumber":"6222896","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and application of a novel class of hierarchical tangential vector finite elements for electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"00753001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050474S","chronDate":"Jan 1999","isNumber":"16263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"52","articleId":"753001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753004,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

The sampling frequency of the received signal is usually kept as low as possible in order to reduce computational complexity, and the peak in the correlation function is found by interpolating the correlation function. The parabolic-fit interpolation method introduces a bias at low sampling rate to the ultrasound center frequency ratio. In this study, four different methods are suggested to improve the estimation accuracy: (1) Parabolic interpolation with bias-compensation, derived from a theoretical signal model. (2) Parabolic interpolation combined with linear filter interpolation of the correlation function. (3) Parabolic interpolation to the complex correlation function envelope. (4) Matched filter interpolation applied to the correlation function. The new interpolation methods are analyzed both by computer simulated signals and RF-signals recorded from a patient with time delay larger than 1/f/sub 0/, where f/sub 0/ is the center frequency. The simulation results show that these methods are more accurate than the parabolic-fit method. From the simulation, the worst estimation accuracy is about 1.25% of 1/f/sub 0/ for the parabolic-fit interpolation, and it is improved by the above methods to less than 0.5% of 1/f/sub 0/ when the sampling rate is 10 MHz, the center frequency is 2.5 MHz and the bandwidth is 1 MHz. This improvement also can be observed in the experimental data. Furthermore, the matched filter interpolation gives the best performance when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. This is verified both by simulation and experimentation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Sampling methods","Matched filters","Computational modeling","Ultrasonic imaging","Delay effects","Frequency estimation","Blood flow","Velocity measurement","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood flow measurement","biomedical ultrasonics","acoustic correlation","interpolation","delay estimation","Doppler measurement","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time delay estimation","cross-correlation method","blood velocity measurement","Doppler ultrasound","pulse echo","parabolic interpolation","matched filter interpolation","computer simulation","RF signal processing","noninvasive clinical diagnosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/58.753016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/16267/00753016.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.753016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation methods for time-delay estimation using cross-correlation method for blood velocity measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation methods for time-delay estimation using cross-correlation method for blood velocity measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753016/","volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6206671","pubMedId":"18238424","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation methods for time-delay estimation using cross-correlation method for blood velocity measurement","sourcePdf":"00753016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033034S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"75","articleId":"753016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":753020,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

The stochastic algorithm of simulated annealing has been utilized to minimize the number of elements necessary to produce a spatial response that meets given requirements. The proposed method is highly innovative, as it can design very large arrays, optimize both positions and weight coefficients, synthesize asymmetric arrays, and generate array configurations that are valid for every steering direction.

In this technique, a conventional Doppler or color Doppler pulse sequence is modified by inverting every second transmit pulse. Either conventional or harmonic Doppler processing is then performed on the received echoes. In the resulting Doppler spectra, Doppler shifts from linear and nonlinear scattering are separated into two distinct regions that can be analyzed separately or combined to estimate the ratio of nonlinear to linear scattering from a region of tissue. The maximum Doppler shift that can be detected is 1/2 the normal Nyquist limit. This has the advantage over conventional harmonic Doppler that it can function over the entire bandwidth of the echo signal, thus achieving superior spatial resolution in the Doppler image. In vitro measurements comparing flowing agent and cellulose particles suggest that pulse inversion Doppler can provide 3 to 10 dB more agent to tissue contrast than harmonic imaging with similar pulses. Similar measurements suggest that broadband pulse inversion Doppler can provide up to 16 dB more contrast than broadband conventional Doppler. Nonlinear propagation effects limit the maximum contrast obtainable with both harmonic and pulse inversion Doppler techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse inversion Doppler: a new method for detecting nonlinear echoes from microbubble contrast agents","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.753026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/16267/00753026.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.753026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Pulse inversion Doppler: a new method for detecting nonlinear echoes from microbubble contrast agents","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6206681","pubMedId":"18238434","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse inversion Doppler: a new method for detecting nonlinear echoes from microbubble contrast agents","sourcePdf":"00753026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038383S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"541","articleId":"753026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":753032,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The computations are performed by the discrete representation array modelling (DREAM) procedure, specially adapted to study the planar and arbitrarily structured multielement transducer arrays. DREAM, based on the discrete representation computational concept, acts as the generator of the array velocity potential impulse response, and thus, does not require any analytical solutions prior to the computations. The computations are valid for all field regions and may be performed for any excitation form. Apart from the classic case of rigid baffle conditions, the free and soft planar baffle also can be considered. The use of the time-domain solution for causal Green's function for lossy media enables the wideband absorption effects to be modeled. The accuracy of computations depends on temporal and spatial discretization and can be obtained as required. The quantitative rules, which determine the required discretizations to be predicted, are proposed. The computational examples show that DREAM allows the different and various transducers to be modeled. Its possibilities are illustrated by computations for the multielement transducers, including the beam-steered, amplitude-weighted sonar array, the focusing annular transducer, and the diverging and converging cylindrical array.","doi":"10.1109/58.753032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.753032","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/16267/00753032.pdf","startPage":"422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to calculate the field radiated from arbitrarily structured transducer arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753032/","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to calculate the field radiated from arbitrarily structured transducer arrays","volume":"46","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6206687","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18238440","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to calculate the field radiated from arbitrarily structured transducer arrays","sourcePdf":"00753032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048484S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"68","articleId":"753032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753049,"authors":[{"name":"I.

First, local regions of code have limited parallelism, and control dependence analysis is useful in extracting global parallelism from different parts of a program. Second, a superscalar processor is fundamentally limited because it cannot execute independent regions of code concurrently. Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors and dataflow machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows of control. Finally, without speculative execution to allow instructions to execute be- fore their control dependences are resolved, only modest amounts of parallelism can be obtained for programs with complex control flow.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limits of Control Flow on Parallelism","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753303","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753303.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"57","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753303.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Limits of Control Flow on Parallelism","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limits of Control Flow on Parallelism","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068149S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"108","articleId":"753303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":753306,"authors":[{"name":"P.

They both have distributed main memory and use directory-based cache coherence. Unlike CC-NUMA, however, COMA machines automatically migrate and replicate data at the main-memory level in cache-line sized chunks. This paper compares the performance of these two classes of machines. We first present a qualitative model that shows that the relative performance is primarily determined by two factors: the relative magnitude of capacity misses versus coherence misses, and the granularity of data partitions in the application. We then present quantitative results using simulation studies for eight parallel applications (including all six applications from the SPLASH benchmark suite). We show that COMA's potential for performance improvement is limited to applications where data accesses by different processors are finely interleaved in memory space and, in addition, where capacity misses dominate over coherence misses. In other situations, for example where coherence misses dominate, COMA can actually perform worse than CC-NUMA due to increased miss latencies caused by its hierarchical directories. Finally, we propose a new architectural alternative, called COMA-F, that combines the advantages of both CC-NUMA and COMA.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753306","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753306.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"91","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753306.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Cache-Coherent NUMA and COMA Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753306/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Cache-Coherent NUMA and COMA Architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Cache-Coherent NUMA and COMA Architectures","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03789S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"35","articleId":"753306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753310,"authors":[{"name":"Tse-Yu Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Tse-Yu Yeh","id":"37333575000"},{"name":"Y.N.

We propose a new dynamic branch predictor (Two-Level Adaptive Branch Prediction) that achieves substantially higher accuracy than any other scheme reported in the literature. The mechanism uses two levels of branch history information to make predictions, the history of the last k branches encountered, and the branch behavior for the last s occurrences of the specific pattern of these k branches. We have identified three variations of the Two-Level Adaptive Branch Prediction, depending on how finely we re- solve the history information gathered. We compute the hardware costs of implementing each of the three variations, and use these costs in evaluating their relative effectiveness. We measure the branch prediction accuracy of the three variations of Two-Level Adaptive Branch Prediction, along with several other popular proposed dynamic and static prediction schemes, on the SPEC benchmarks. We show that the average prediction accuracy for Two-Level Adaptive Branch Prediction is 97 percent, while the other known schemes achieve at most 94.4 percent average prediction accuracy. We measure the effectiveness of different prediction algorithms and different amounts of history and pattern information.

Large cache blocks exploit processor and spatial locality, but may cause unnecessary cache invalidations due to false sharing. Small cache blocks can reduce the number of cache invalidations, but increase the number of bus or network transactions required to load data into the cache. In this paper we describe a cache organization that dynamically adjusts the cache block size according to recently observed reference behavior. Cache blocks are split across cache lines when false sharing occurs, and merged back into a single cache line to exploit spatial locality. To evaluate this cache organization, we simulate a scalable multiprocessor with coherent caches, using a suite of memory reference traces to model program behavior. We show that for every fixed block size, some program suffers a 33% in- crease in the average waiting time per reference, and a factor of 2 increase in the average number of words transferred per reference, when compared against the performance of an adjustable block size cache. In the few cases where adjusting the block size does not provide superior performance, it comes within 7% of the best fixed block size alternative. We conclude that an adjustable block size cache offers significantly better performance than every fixed block size cache, especially when there is variability in the granularity of sharing exhibited by applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753314","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","startPage":"170","endPage":"180","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753314.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjustable Block Size Coherent Caches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adjustable Block Size Coherent Caches","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753314/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable Block Size Coherent Caches","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037745S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"14","articleId":"753314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753316,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Unfortunately, direct-mapped caches have higher miss rates than set-associative caches, largely because direct mapped caches are more sensitive to conflicts between items needed frequently in the same phase of program execution. This paper presents a new technique for reducing direct-mapped cache misses caused by conflicts for a particular cache line. A small finite state machine recognizes the common instruction reference patterns where storing an instruction in the cache actually harms performance. Such instructions are dynamically excluded, that is they are passed directly through the cache without being stored. This reduces misses to the instructions that would have been replaced. The effectiveness of dynamic exclusion is dependent on the severity of cache conflicts and thus on the particular program and cache size of interest. However, across the SPEC benchmarks, simulation results show an average reduction in miss rate of 33% for a 32KB instruction cache with 16B lines. In addition, applying dynamic exclusion to one level of a cache hierarchy can improve the performance of the next level since instructions do not need to be stored on both levels. Finally, dynamic exclusion also improves combined instruction and data cache miss rates.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753316","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753316.png","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753316.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"200","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache Replacement with Dynamic Exclusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Cache Replacement with Dynamic Exclusion","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753316/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Replacement with Dynamic Exclusion","confLoc":"Gold Coast, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029439S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"10","articleId":"753316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":753317,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

The compiler statically schedules individual threads to discover available inter-thread instruction-level parallelism. The runtime scheduling mechanism interleaves threads, exploiting inter-thread parallelism to maintain high ALU utilization. ALUs are assigned to threads on a cycle by cycle basis, and several threads can be active concurrently.

We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages, show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2 and CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C.

With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern.

Adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages spreading load over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of dead- lock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels [17]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adagtive networks are guaranteed to be deadlock free. In the presence of network faults, the planar adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to pro- duce a working network which remains provably dead lock free and is provably livelock free, In addition, planar adaptive networks can simultaneously sup ort both in-order and adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery. Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two dimensions (with k > 2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed or allowing additional performance-enhancing network features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is amenable to efficient implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753323","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","startPage":"268","endPage":"277","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753323.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planar-Adaptive Routing: Low-cost Adaptive Networks for Multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planar-Adaptive Routing: Low-cost Adaptive Networks for Multiprocessors","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753323/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planar-Adaptive Routing: Low-cost Adaptive Networks for Multiprocessors","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039275S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"107","articleId":"753323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753324,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

A unique feature of this model is that it is not based on adding physical or virtual channels to network topologies (though it can be applied to networks with extra channels). Instead, the model is based on analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Prohibiting just enough turns to break all of the cycles produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free, livelock free, minimal or nonminimal, and maximally adaptive for the network. In this paper, we focus on the two most common network topologies for wormhole routing, n-dimensional meshes and k-ary n-cubes, without extra channels. In an n-dimensional mesh, just a quarter of the turns must be prohibited to prevent deadlock. The remaining three quarters of the turns permit partial adaptiveness in routing. Partially adaptive routing algorithms are described for 2D meshes, n-dimensional meshes, k-ary n-cubes, and hypercubes. Simulations of partially adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms for 2D meshes and hypercubes show that which algorithm has the lowest latencies and highest sustainable throughput depends on the pattern of message traffic. For nonuniform traffic, partially adaptive routing algorithms perform better than nonadaptive ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Turn Model for Adaptive Routing","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753324","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753324.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"287","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753324.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"The Turn Model for Adaptive Routing","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Turn Model for Adaptive Routing","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031277S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"286","articleId":"753324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":753330,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

With the current trend in architecture of enhancing the performance of uniprocessors by exploiting fine-grain parallelism, first-order metrics of program execution, such as operation frequencies, are not sufficient; characterizing the exact nature of dependencies between operations is essential. This paper presents a methodology for constructing the dynamic execution graph that characterizes the execution of an ordinary program (an application program written in an imperative language such as C or FORTRAN) from a serial execution trace of the program. It then uses the methodology to study parallelism in the SPEC benchmarks. We see that the parallelism can be bursty in nature (periods of lots of parallelism followed by periods of little parallelism), but the average parallelism is quite high, ranging from 13 to 23,302 operations per cycle. Exposing this parallelism requires renaming of both registers and memory, though renaming registers alone exposes much of this parallelism. We also see that fairly large windows of dynamic instructions would be required to expose this parallelism from a sequential instruction stream.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1992.753330","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings the 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel4/6079/16270/00753330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1992.753330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16270","startPage":"342","endPage":"351","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753330.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Dependency Analysis of Ordinary Programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Dependency Analysis of Ordinary Programs","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753330/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Dependency Analysis of Ordinary Programs","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037478S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"16270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079","citationCount":"33","articleId":"753330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753333,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An objective of this process is to minimize the number of faults in delivered code. Root cause analysis shows that many of the faults can be traced back to requirements or design faults. As part of the software development process, reviews are conducted to remove these faults before the requirements or design document is passed on to the next step. We have developed a method of instrumenting a review process to record document faults discovered by reviewers during their preparation. Then, using statistical techniques related to capture-recapture methods, we estimate the number of undiscovered faults remaining in the document. The key idea to our method is to look at how many common faults independent reviewers find and then extrapolate to die total number of faults. We do not seed the document with artificial faults - no additional faults are introduced. We have applied our methods to 13 review sessions (either feature requirements or feature design) and are in the process of a longitudinal study tracing these features. Our results to date estimate that about 20% of the faults are undetected by reviews. When the predicted number of undetected faults is greater than 20%, consideration should be given to reworking design and/or rereviewing the result. One surprising by-product of this study is a quantification of the number of faults found by group reviews. We find that only about 10% of the (discovered) document faults are found at the review (90% are found in preparation) and that the lead time to schedule a review is about ten working days.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1992.753490","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/6076/16236/00753490.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1992.753490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16236","startPage":"59","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating software fault content before coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating software fault content before coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753490/","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating software fault content before coding","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041825S","chronDate":"0-0  1992","isNumber":"16236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076","citationCount":"59","articleId":"753490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753508,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.

Code Analysis tools (e.g., cross referencing tools such as CIA and Cscope) can be very helpful in this process. In this paper we describe GENOA, an application generator that can produce a whole range of useful code analysis tools. GENOA is designed to be language- and front-end independent; it can be interfaced to any front-end for any language that produces an attributed parse tree, simply by writing an interface spec- ification. While GENOA programs can perform arbitrary analyses on the parse tree, the GENOA language has special, compact iteration operators that are tuned for expressing simple, polynomial time analysis programs; in fact, there is a useful sublanguage of GENOA that can express precisely all (and only) polynomial time (PTIME) analysis prograrns on parse-trees. Thus, we argue that GENOA is a convenient \"little language\" to implement simple, fast analysis tools. We describe the system, provide several practical examples, and present complexity and expressivity results for the abovementioned sublanguage of GENOA.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1992.753508","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/6076/16236/00753508.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1992.753508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1992","displayDocTitle":"GENOA - A Customizable, Language- And Front-end Independent Code Analyzer","conferenceDate":"11-15 May 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753508/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GENOA - A Customizable, Language- And Front-end Independent Code Analyzer","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00753508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030019S","chronDate":"0-0  1992","isNumber":"16236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6076","citationCount":"67","articleId":"753508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":753512,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The probabilistic basis for behavior sampling is described, and experimental results are reported that suggest basic behavior-sampling exhibits high precision (percentage of retrieved components that are relevant).

The flexibility on design rules is allowed, because the Cu/BCB structure has the advantages of excellent planarization, and low electrical resistance of signal line. Long-term reliability test was successfully done; thermal cycle(-45/spl deg/C/125/spl deg/), high-temperature aging at 125/spl deg/C, and high-temperature/humidity(85/spl deg/C/85%).

This paper describes a novel assembly technique for flip-chip silicon-on-silicon Multi-Chip Module (MCM-D) tiles which readily meets the above criteria. This new hybrid technique, which is called AT&T /spl mu/SMT, involves stencil printing a custom AT&T ultra-fine pitch solder paste directly onto a silicon fabric wafer which is then populated with bare die and reflowed, much as surface mount packaged components would be assembled onto a circuit board. This approach is capable of achieving higher component and interconnection densities than can be achieved with any fine-pitch SMT design - and at a lower unit cost at large production volumes than can be achieved with any other MCM assembly technology.","doi":"10.1109/ICMCM.1994.753561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMCM.1994.753561","startPage":"266","endPage":"272","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Multichip Modules","pdfPath":"/iel4/6078/16260/00753561.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Multichip Modules","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16260","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753561.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AT&T spl mu/Surface Mount Assembly: A New Technology for the Large Volume Fabrication of Cost Effective Flip-Chip MCMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"AT&T spl mu/Surface Mount Assembly: A New Technology for the Large Volume Fabrication of Cost Effective Flip-Chip MCMs","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753561/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AT&T spl mu/Surface Mount Assembly: A New Technology for the Large Volume Fabrication of Cost Effective Flip-Chip MCMs","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00753561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021944S","chronDate":"13-15 Apr 1994","isNumber":"16260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6078","citationCount":"16","articleId":"753561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":753620,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Formosa Plastics Company, Point Comfort, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jen-Hung Chen","id":"37087348083"},{"name":"Wei-Jen Lee","affiliation":["Energy Systems Research Center, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Jen Lee","id":"37087155450"},{"name":"Mo-Shing Chen","affiliation":["Energy Systems Research Center, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Mo-Shing Chen","id":"37087212041"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"753620","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1129},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753620","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Power system dynamics","Computer simulation","Inductors","Phase control","Power system control","Power systems","Control systems","Circuits","Microcomputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution control","reactive power control","static VAr compensators","power system stability","control system synthesis","thyristor convertors","power system analysis computing","control system analysis computing","microcomputer applications","phase control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution system balancing","static VAr compensator","PSS","control design","fixed capacitor-thyristor-controlled reactor","individual phase control scheme","negative-sequence current reduction","microcomputer control","power factor improvement","computer simulation","mathematical model","control simulation"]}],"abstract":"An algorithm for applying a fixed capacitor-thyristor-controlled reactor (FC-TCR) type of static VAr compensator (SVC) in a distribution system to dynamically balance such a system is introduced.

As a result, Fourier analysis makes it difficult to recognize fault conditions from the normal operating conditions of the motor. Time-frequency analysis, on the other hand, unambiguously represents the motor current which makes signal properties related to fault detection more evident in the transform domain. In this paper, the authors present an adaptive, statistical, time-frequency method for the detection of broken bars and bearing faults. Due to the time-varying normal operating conditions of the motor and the effect of motor geometry on the current, they employ a training-based approach in which the algorithm is trained to recognize the normal operating modes of the motor before the actual testing starts. During the training stage, features which are relevant to fault detection are estimated using the torque and mechanical speed estimation. These features are then statistically analyzed and segmented into normal operating modes of the motor. For each mode, a representative and a threshold are computed and stored in a database to be used as a baseline during the testing stage. In the testing stage, the distance of the test features to the mode representatives are computed and compared with the thresholds. If it is larger than all the thresholds, the measurement is tagged as a potential fault signal. In the postprocessing stage, the testing is repeated for multiple measurements to improve the accuracy of the detection. The experimental results from their study suggest that the proposed method provides a powerful and a general approach to the motor-current-based fault detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive statistical time-frequency method for detection of broken bars and bearing faults in motors using stator current","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.753640","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/16277/00753640.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.753640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive statistical time-frequency method for detection of broken bars and bearing faults in motors using stator current","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1999","accessionNumber":"6223016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive statistical time-frequency method for detection of broken bars and bearing faults in motors using stator current","sourcePdf":"00753640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03897S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","isNumber":"16277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"204","articleId":"753640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753642,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A short circuit is a basic and severe fault situation in a circuit structure, such as voltage-source converters. This paper presents a new active protection circuit for fast and precise clamping and safe shutdown of fault currents of the insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). This circuit allows operation of the IGBTs with a higher on-state gate voltage, which can thereby reduce the conduction loss in the device without compromising the short-circuit protection characteristics. The operation of the circuit is studied under various conditions, considering variation of temperature, rising rate of fault current, gate voltage value and protection circuit parameters. An evaluation of the operation of the circuit is made using IGBTs from different manufacturers to confirm the effectiveness of the protection circuit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.753644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/16277/00753644.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"486","doi":"10.1109/28.753644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast-clamped short-circuit protection of IGBT's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fast-clamped short-circuit protection of IGBT's","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1999","accessionNumber":"6223020","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753644/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast-clamped short-circuit protection of IGBT's","sourcePdf":"00753644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069652S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","isNumber":"16277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"49","articleId":"753644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":753645,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The technique, spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER), measures the interference between a pair of spectrally sheared replicas of the input pulse. Direct (noniterative) inversion of the interferogram yields the electric field of the input pulse without ambiguity. The interferogram, which is solely a function of frequency, is resolved with a spectrometer and recorded with a slow detector. Moreover, the geometry is entirely collinear and requires no moving components. This paper describes in detail the principle of operation, apparatus, and calibration of SPIDER and gives experimental examples of reconstructed pulses.","doi":"10.1109/3.753654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.753654","endPage":"509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/16275/00753654.pdf","startPage":"501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-referencing spectral interferometry for measuring ultrashort optical pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753654/","displayDocTitle":"Self-referencing spectral interferometry for measuring ultrashort optical pulses","volume":"35","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6222952","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-referencing spectral interferometry for measuring ultrashort optical pulses","sourcePdf":"00753654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046961S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"328","articleId":"753654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":753660,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The operation and performance of micromechanical resonators are modeled, with emphasis on circuit and noise modeling of multiport resonators. A series resonant oscillator design is discussed that utilizes a unique, gain-controllable transresistance sustaining amplifier. We show that in the absence of an automatic level control loop, the closed-loop, steady-state oscillation amplitude of this oscillator depends strongly upon the dc-bias voltage applied to the capacitively driven and sensed /spl mu/resonator. Although the high-Q of the micromechanical resonator does contribute to improved oscillator stability, its limited power-handling ability outweighs the Q benefits and prevents this oscillator from achieving the high short-term stability normally expected of high-Q oscillators.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/16274/00753677.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.753677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.753677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated CMOS micromechanical resonator high-Q oscillator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Micromechanical devices","Oscillators","Semiconductor device modeling","Micromachining","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit technology","Frequency","Circuit stability","Circuit noise","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","oscillators","micromechanical resonators","micromachining","circuit stability","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated CMOS polysilicon micromechanical resonator","monolithic high-Q oscillator","surface micromachining","stability","multiport resonator","circuit model","noise","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"An integrated CMOS micromechanical resonator high-Q oscillator","volume":"34","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6222867","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated CMOS micromechanical resonator high-Q oscillator","sourcePdf":"00753677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038973S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"292","articleId":"753677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753678,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A variable-frequency digital controller design takes advantage of the power savings available through adaptive supply-voltage scaling and demonstrates converter efficiency greater than 90% over a dynamic range of regulated voltage levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/16274/00753685.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.753685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.753685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully digital, energy-efficient, adaptive power-supply regulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Regulators","Dynamic voltage scaling","Digital control","Voltage control","Energy consumption","Digital circuits","Digital-to-frequency converters","Circuit optimization","Ring oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage regulators","power supply circuits","adaptive control","DC-DC power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power-supply regulator","voltage scaling technique","energy-efficient operation","dynamic power consumption","synchronous digital circuits","digitally controlled power converter","ring oscillator","MOSIS","variable-frequency digital controller","supply-voltage scaling","converter efficiency","dynamic range","regulated voltage levels","0.8 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"A fully digital, energy-efficient, adaptive power-supply regulator","volume":"34","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6222875","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully digital, energy-efficient, adaptive power-supply regulator","sourcePdf":"00753685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037038S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"101","articleId":"753685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753687,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The turn-off failures observed in measurements at two temperatures showed no temperature dependence and could not be reproduced in ordinary one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) device simulations. To simulate the stability of the current density toward current filamentation, two 1-D diodes with an area ratio 1:19 and a 10% difference in initial carrier plasma level, were simulated in parallel. This resulted in a strongly inhomogeneous current distribution, and a rapid reverse voltage fall resembling the measured turn-off failures. Inhomogeneous current distribution in these simulations appears as the current decay ceases due to impact ionization, in qualitative agreement with a current instability condition proposed by Wachutka [1991].","doi":"10.1109/16.753714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/16273/00753714.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.753714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic avalanche in 3.3-kV Si power diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic avalanche in 3.3-kV Si power diodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6217434","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic avalanche in 3.3-kV Si power diodes","sourcePdf":"00753714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042306S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"19","articleId":"753714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":753719,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The primary focus is on the delay profile, which is the normalized plot of received power versus delay in response to an RT \"impulse.\" We describe measurement campaigns in the western suburbs of Chicago, IL, and in suburban north-central New Jersey. Our analysis of the data suggests to us that, for directive terminal antennas, the delay profile can be modeled as having a \"spike-plus-exponential\" shape, i.e., a strong return (\"spike\") at the lowest delay, plus a set of returns whose mean powers decay exponentially with delay. This delay profile can be characterized by just two parameters (both variable over the terrain), namely, the ratio (K/sub 0/) of the average powers in the \"spike\" and \"exponential\" components and the decay time constant (/spl tau//sub 0/) of the \"exponential\" component. No such simple structure appears to apply for delay profiles using omnidirectional antennas. For a directive antenna with a 32/spl deg/ beamwidth, we find that: (1) the statistical correlation between the profile parameters K/sub 0/ and /spl tau//sub 0/ is negligible; (2) these parameters are relatively insensitive to antenna height and path length; and (3) over each measured region (Illinois and New Jersey), K/sub 0/ and /spl tau//sub 0/ have median values close to 8 dB and just below 0.2 /spl mu/s, respectively. Moreover, we have found simple probability distributions that accurately portray the variability of K/sub 0/ and /spl tau//sub 0/ over the terrain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753726.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"410","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.753726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for the multipath delay profile of fixed wireless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directive antennas","Antenna measurements","Delay effects","Propagation delay","Time domain analysis","Frequency","Multiaccess communication","Time division multiple access","Base stations","Life members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF radio propagation","multipath channels","delays","statistical analysis","directive antennas","correlation methods","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed wireless channels","multipath delay profile","modeling","measurement","suburban environments","normalized plot","received power","response delay","western suburbs","Chicago","New Jersey","data analysis","directive terminal antennas","spike-plus-exponential shape","mean power","terrain","average powers ratio","exponential decay","decay time constant","omnidirectional antennas","beamwidth","statistical correlation","profile parameters","antenna height","path length","Illinois","probability distributions","UHF","1.9 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"A model for the multipath delay profile of fixed wireless channels","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6216876","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for the multipath delay profile of fixed wireless channels","sourcePdf":"00753726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141678S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"116","articleId":"753726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753727,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhu","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jie Zhu","id":"37350680600"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi Ding","id":"37278651400"},{"name":"Xi-Ren Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xi-Ren Cao","id":"37276620700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"753727","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Intersymbol interference","Convolution","Delay","MIMO","Interference cancellation","Finite impulse response filter","Statistics","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient response","blind equalisers","cellular radio","multiuser channels","convolution","matrix algebra","delays","statistical analysis","MIMO systems","memoryless systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","minimum shift keying","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["column-anchored zeroforcing blind equalization","multiuser wireless FIR channels","direct blind zeroforcing","intersymbol interference","ISI cancellation","finite impulse response","FIR channels","channel convolution matrix","output delay","blind identification algorithms","channel orders","second-order statistics","received signals","single-input-multiple-output","multiple-input-multiple-output","dynamic MIMO systems","SIMO systems","memoryless signal mixing system","source separation","simulation results","linear quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","nonlinear GMSK modulation","wireless GSM systems","computational cost","Viterbi algorithm","multipath channel"]}],"abstract":"We propose a direct blind zeroforcing approach to cancel intersymbol interference (ISI) in multiple user finite impulse response (FIR) channels. By selectively anchoring columns of the channel convolution matrix, we present two column-anchored zeroforcing equalizers (CAZE), one without output delay and one with a chosen delay. Unlike many known blind identification algorithms, these equalizers do not need an accurate estimate of the channel orders. Exploiting second-order statistics (SOS) of the received signals, they can retain preselected d columns in the channel convolution matrix (d is the number of users) and force the remaining columns to zero. CAZE can effectively equalize single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) systems and can reduce dynamic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems into a memoryless signal mixing system for source separation. Simulation results show that the CAZE is not only effective for blind equalization of linear quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems, but it is also applicable to the nonlinear GMSK modulation in the popular wireless GSM systems when computational cost severely limits the use of nonlinear methods such as the Viterbi algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/49.753727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753727.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Column-anchored zeroforcing blind equalization for multiuser wireless FIR channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753727/","displayDocTitle":"Column-anchored zeroforcing blind equalization for multiuser wireless FIR channels","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6216877","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Column-anchored zeroforcing blind equalization for multiuser wireless FIR channels","sourcePdf":"00753727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062158S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","articleId":"753727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753728,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The performance, i.e., high-resolution ability, accuracy, and convergence rate of the scheme, is assessed in synthetic and real macro- and pico-cellular channels. The results indicate that the scheme overcomes the resolution limitation inherent to classical techniques like the Fourier or beam-forming methods. In particular, it is shown that waves which exhibit an arbitrarily small difference in azimuth can be easily separated as long as their delays or Doppler frequencies differ by a fraction of the intrinsic resolution of the measurement equipment. Two waves are claimed to be separated when the mean-squared estimation errors (MSEEs) of the estimates of their parameters are close to the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) derived in a scenario where only a single wave is impinging. The adverb easily means that the MSEEs rapidly approach the CLRBs, i.e., within less than 20 iteration cycles. Convergence of the log-likelihood sequence is achieved after approximately ten iteration cycles when the scheme is applied in real channels. In this use, the estimated dominant waves can be related to a scatterer/reflector in the propagation environment. The investigations demonstrate that the SAGE algorithm is a powerful high-resolution tool that can be successfully applied for parameter extraction from extensive channel measurement data, especially for the purpose of channel modeling.","doi":"10.1109/49.753729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753729","startPage":"434","endPage":"450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753729.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel parameter estimation in mobile radio environments using the SAGE algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Channel parameter estimation in mobile radio environments using the SAGE algorithm","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6216879","publicationDate":"March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel parameter estimation in mobile radio environments using the SAGE algorithm","sourcePdf":"00753729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065188S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"636","articleId":"753729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":753730,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Data is encoded using a space-time block code, and the encoded data is split into n streams which are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. Maximum likelihood decoding is achieved in a simple way through decoupling of the signals transmitted from different antennas rather than joint detection. This uses the orthogonal structure of the space-time block code and gives a maximum likelihood decoding algorithm which is based only on linear processing at the receiver. We review the encoding and decoding algorithms for various codes and provide simulation results demonstrating their performance. It is shown that using multiple transmit antennas and space-time block coding provides remarkable performance at the expense of almost no extra processing.","doi":"10.1109/49.753730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753730.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time block coding for wireless communications: performance results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Space-time block coding for wireless communications: performance results","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6216880","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time block coding for wireless communications: performance results","sourcePdf":"00753730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026877S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1288","articleId":"753730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":753731,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Red Bank, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Ye Li","id":"37350651600"},{"name":"N.

The overall receiver performance using such a transmitter diversity scheme is demonstrated by extensive computer simulations. For an OFDM system with two transmitter antennas and two receiver antennas with transmission efficiency as high as 1.475 bits/s/Hz, the required signal-to-noise ratio is only about 7 dB for a 1% bit error rate and 9 dB for a 10% word error rate assuming channels with two-ray, typical urban, and hilly terrain delay profiles, and a 40-Hz Doppler frequency.

Attention is now focused on higher data-rate packet services for cellular systems. Although many packet multiple access schemes have been studied over the years, researchers have often studied single cell performance and ignored reuse. Moreover, direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) has been considered unsuitable for high data-rate packet multiple access since spreading limits the permitted data rates, DSSS requires large overhead (preambles) for acquisition and requires closed-loop power control. In this paper, we describe a scheme for high data-rate packet service using CDMA that addresses all of the above problems and has been standardized in Revision B of IS-95. A low rate fundamental code channel is maintained that eliminates the need for long preamble and provides closed-loop power control. Reuse is managed by the infrastructure through a \"burst-level\" admission control based on load and interference-level measurements at the base stations and mobiles. We report on the feasibility of such a burst-mode packet data service for cellular CDMA networks. The focus is not only on the performance of high data-rate users, but also on the impact on voice users sharing the CDMA band. We propose a multitiered performance analysis methodology consisting of a mix of static simulations, dynamic simulations at different time scales, and analytic methods to address the various feasibility issues: impact on coverage; capacity; power control; and effectiveness of burst admission algorithms. Based on the current study, we can conclude that the proposed approach is well suited for third-generation wideband CDMA systems being considered for standardization throughout the world.","doi":"10.1109/49.753732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753732.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High data-rate packet communications for cellular networks using CDMA: algorithms and performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753732/","displayDocTitle":"High data-rate packet communications for cellular networks using CDMA: algorithms and performance","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6216882","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High data-rate packet communications for cellular networks using CDMA: algorithms and performance","sourcePdf":"00753732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036923S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"75","articleId":"753732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753733,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The basic idea of QRA-IA is for every base to periodically turn off each of its beams (sectors) for a certain amount of time. This periodic turn off introduces a predictable nonuniformity in a terminal's performance and therefore permits each terminal to identify a preferred time period for transmission. QRA-IA requires that each terminal sense the interference over time, select the preferred transmission periods, and report these to the base. The resource allocation algorithm at the base can then use this information for scheduling transmissions to the terminals. The base can also use this information for obtaining an appropriate beam-off sequence. A graph theory model is used to show that an acceptable beam-off sequence exists for each base. A simple, distributed, and measurement-based beam-switching algorithm is designed for the system to find these sequences autonomously. We demonstrate via simulations that a system with QRA-IA provides a marked improvement in the packet error rate performance of terminals over the same system without QRA-IA. This improvement translates directly to improved coverage and throughput and also reduces the burden on higher layer protocols to ensure fairness and quality of service.","doi":"10.1109/49.753733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/16279/00753733.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.753733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-static resource allocation with interference avoidance for fixed wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753733/","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-static resource allocation with interference avoidance for fixed wireless systems","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6216883","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-static resource allocation with interference avoidance for fixed wireless systems","sourcePdf":"00753733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029784S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","articleId":"753733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":753739,"authors":[{"name":"H.K.

Plots of the vertical and horizontal projections versus frame number give new images in which uniformly moving objects are represented by skewed band regions, with the angles of the skew from the vertical being a measure of the velocities of the moving objects. For example, vertical bands will correspond to objects with zero velocity. An algorithm called subspace-based line detection (SLIDE) can be used to efficiently determine the skew angles. SLIDE exploits the temporal coherence between the contributions of each of the moving patterns in the frame projections to enhance and distinguish a signal subspace that is defined by the desired motion parameters. A similar procedure can be used to determine the vertical velocities. Some further steps must then be taken to properly associate the horizontal and vertical velocities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16278/00753739.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.753739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.753739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of multiple 2-D uniform motions by SLIDE: subspace-based line detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Motion detection","Image sequences","Motion analysis","Object detection","Two dimensional displays","Parameter estimation","Layout","Image motion analysis","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","parameter estimation","image sequences","motion estimation","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple 2-D uniform motions","SLIDE","subspace-based line detection","multiple moving objects","scene","long-sequence image processing","multiline fitting algorithm","vertical projections","horizontal projections","frame number","uniformly moving objects","skewed band regions","velocities","moving objects","skew angles","temporal coherence","moving patterns","frame projections","signal subspace","motion parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of multiple 2-D uniform motions by SLIDE: subspace-based line detection","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6224501","pubMedId":"18262895","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of multiple 2-D uniform motions by SLIDE: subspace-based line detection","sourcePdf":"00753739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022417S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"17","articleId":"753739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":753742,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Realizable as matrix-valued filterbanks leading to wavelet bases, multiwavelets offer simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry, and short support, which is not possible with scalar two-channel wavelet systems. After reviewing this theory, we examine the use of multiwavelets in a filterbank setting for discrete-time signal and image processing. Multiwavelets differ from scalar wavelet systems in requiring two or more input streams to the multiwavelet filterbank. We describe two methods (repeated row and approximation/deapproximation) for obtaining such a vector input stream from a one-dimensional (1-D) signal. Algorithms for symmetric extension of signals at boundaries are then developed, and naturally integrated with approximation-based preprocessing. We describe an additional algorithm for multiwavelet processing of two-dimensional (2-D) signals, two rows at a time, and develop a new family of multiwavelets (the constrained pairs) that is well-suited to this approach. This suite of novel techniques is then applied to two basic signal processing problems, denoising via wavelet-shrinkage, and data compression. After developing the approach via model problems in one dimension, we apply multiwavelet processing to images, frequently obtaining performance superior to the comparable scalar wavelet transform.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/16278/00753742.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.753742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.753742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of multiwavelet filterbanks to image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Signal processing","Multiresolution analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Two dimensional displays","Noise reduction","Image coding","Mathematics","Filtering theory","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","wavelet transforms","channel bank filters","filtering theory","signal processing","image coding","image resolution","approximation theory","noise","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","multiwavelet filterbanks","matrix-valued filterbanks","wavelet bases","orthogonality","symmetry","short support","wavelet theory","discrete-time signal processing","multiresolution analysis","image coding","repeated row method","approximation/deapproximation method","vector input stream","1D signal","algorithms","approximation-based preprocessing","multiwavelet processing","2D signals","denoising","wavelet-shrinkage","data compression","performance","scalar wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"The application of multiwavelet filterbanks to image processing","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6224504","pubMedId":"18262898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of multiwavelet filterbanks to image processing","sourcePdf":"00753742.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08416S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"280","articleId":"753742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":753746,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

Other benefits of L/UL include increased areal density due to smooth disk surfaces, thinner overcoats and lower head flying height; improved shock resistance due to elimination of head slap; and reduced power consumption. Several mechanical design options exist for L/UL, and tolerance analysis plays a key role in height budgeting, interdisk spacing, and disk real estate usage. To prevent stiction failures arising from unintended landing of heads on stopped disks, a reliable actuator latch and power-off retract system are employed. A bidirectional inertia latch has better reliability than conventional inertia latch designs. A low voltage drop retract rectifier is required for reliable power-off retract in drives with supply voltages of 5 V or less.","doi":"10.1109/20.753798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/16224/00753798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.753798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16224","startPage":"857","endPage":"862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load/Unload technology for disk drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load/Unload technology for disk drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load/Unload technology for disk drives","sourcePdf":"00753798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026316S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"35","articleId":"753798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753803,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Experimental measurements of the drive's PES (position-error signal) in ontrack mode are used to determine the spectrum of the perceived TMR, which is then broken down into component parts. The total RMS nonsynchronous perceived TMR of 0.56% of a track is found to be composed of 0.17%, due to torque disturbances, 0.33%, due to disk motions, 0.42% due to PES demodulation noise, with 0.04% unaccounted for (the total being the root-sum-of-squares of the components). With the assumption of a doubling of the PES noise, a factor of two reduction in the disk vibrations, a quadrupling in the servo sample-rate, and a doubling of the loop bandwidth, the authors show that an RMS ontrack, nonsynchronous, self-induced TMR of 1.67% of a track is possible with a track-density of roughly 72000 TPI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/16224/00753803.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.753803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.753803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Major HDD TMR sources and projected scaling with TPI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tracking loops","Hard disks","Position measurement","Rotation measurement","Signal processing","Torque","Demodulation","Noise reduction","Servomechanisms","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard discs","disc drives","torque","demodulation","vibrations","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HDD TMR sources","projected scaling","TPI","nonsynchronous track misregistration","HDD","hard-disk drive","track-density","rotational rate","position-error signal","torque disturbances","disk motions","PES demodulation noise","disk vibrations","servo sample-rate","loop bandwidth","90 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Major HDD TMR sources and projected scaling with TPI","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Major HDD TMR sources and projected scaling with TPI","sourcePdf":"00753803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046162S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"65","articleId":"753803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753808,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Hua Zeng","affiliation":["Computer Mechanics Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Qing-Hua Zeng","id":"37087000816"},{"name":"M.

In this paper the dynamics of negative pressure sliders during the unload process was investigated by simulation and experiment.

Two slider designs have been simulated and measured at various disk rotation speeds. Good correlation between the experimental and simulation results was achieved. During unload the air bearing suction force causes dimple separation. By selecting an optimal speed for unload, we can decrease the amount of dimple separation for a given slider design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6198650","volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of the unload process for negative pressure sliders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of the unload process for negative pressure sliders","sourcePdf":"00753808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033384S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"16224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","articleId":"753808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":753819,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

Thus five separate algorithms had been developed to detect these faults. The technique of windowing was employed to reduce the amount of redundant data to be processed. Preprocessing functions like convolution as well as all image processing tasks are performed on the window regions only, saving tremendously on computation time. Experimental results showed that these algorithms are reliable; fast and cost-effective.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753907.png","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON '91.

Traditionally, the production process of accurate and smooth surfaces consists of some roughing steps, like turning, and subsequent finishing steps, like polishing or precision grinding. Two new grinding processes, however, electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID), and high-speed chipping (HSC), can combine high removal rates with high surface quality through a mechanism of submicron chip removal. For the successful application of these processes, very stiff, ultra-precision positioning systems are needed. Classical solutions, based on traditional guide way technology, cannot meet the requirements of these new machining processes. The piezo-stepper solution presented in this paper can provide accurate motion, combined with high stiffness, through the use of piezo-electric actuators with high resolution. High passive stiffness is provided thanks to the integration of the driving, bearing and transmission functions. The same actuators can provide an extremely high active stiffness by referring the position of the positioning stage with respect to an absolute reference frame. In contrast with existing (position-controlled) piezo-steppers, this paper presents a way to provide smooth stepping by avoiding hammering through hybrid force-position controlled clamping and by rolling traction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.753933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/5488303/16286/00753933.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"39","doi":"10.1109/37.753933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid force-position control of clamping with a piezo-stepper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid force-position control of clamping with a piezo-stepper","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6221011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid force-position control of clamping with a piezo-stepper","sourcePdf":"00753933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031942S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"5","articleId":"753933","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":753963,"authors":[{"name":"F.F.

The algorithm takes advantage of the tracking capability of gradient techniques. The realizations for this algorithm require minimal hardware compared to other implementations for synchronous amplitude demodulation. Either the digital or the analog realization requires at most two (2) multipliers, an adder and a subtractor. Low pass filtering will only be required for high accuracy applications. The technique and realizations introduced in this paper rely on the availability of both the modulated carrier signal and the reference carrier. The algorithm presented is similar to the LMS adaptive algorithm. The coefficients of the adaptive structure track the message signal to be detected.

The leading possibilities for timing recovery are either band-edge, or conventional envelope-derived using the common nonlinearities of magnitude, square, or fourth-power. A novel implementation is proposed for band-edge timing recovery. With this method, the vector representing the band spectral line is derived by digital correlation techniques, and then this vector is filtered in such a way that the timing recovery loop can attain fast convergence while tracking worst case frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver master oscillators. It is shown experimentally that for signals chosen from the CCITT V.33 trellis-coded 128-QAM constellation having 12.5% excess bandwidth and square-root Nyquist shaping at the transmitter, band-edge timing recovery is preferred over conventional envelope-derived, as it is the only one which can recover the baud spectral line in a reasonably jitter-free manner over both moderately and severely impaired channels.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753964","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753964.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/6081/16283/00753964.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753964","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","startPage":"112","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Recovery For Blind Equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1988","displayDocTitle":"Timing Recovery For Blind Equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753964/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Recovery For Blind Equalization","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00753964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0388S","chronDate":"1988","isNumber":"16283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081","citationCount":"6","articleId":"753964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":753972,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Dawei","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Railway Technology, China"],"lastName":"Huang Dawei","id":"37088112995"},{"name":"Chang Lu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Railway Technology, China"],"lastName":"Chang Lu","id":"37088115755"},{"name":"Xiong Tongzhou","lastName":"Xiong Tongzhou","id":"37086997171"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6393"}],"articleNumber":"753972","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Digital filters","Attenuation","Passband","Bandwidth","Equations","Rats","Interpolation","Band pass filters","Converters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=753972","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16283","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753972.png","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/6081/16283/00753972.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Rate Alteration In Circulator Wave Digital Filters","abstract":"The study, presented in this paper indicates that the computation rate is minimized in two- or three- stage realization.

The proposed implementation is most effective when only a very few complex frequencies on the Z -plane is to be evaluated via CZT. In particular, it is shown that a seal- ing operation in the CZT algorithm can be conveniently implemented with a norm correction (normalization) computation, which is often considered as an overhead, in the CORDIC algorithm. Furthermore, since the desired frequencies of CZT are specified before computation, it is possible to reduce the total number of CORDIC iterations by finding a most economic representation of the angle in terms of the elementary CORDIC rotation angles. A greedy algorithm which takes only O(n2) operations is developed to perform the angle recoding. Simulation results are also presented to verify the proposed scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753974","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1988.753974","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/6081/16283/00753974.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00753974.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementation Of Chirp Z-Transform Using A Cordic Processor*","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation Of Chirp Z-Transform Using A Cordic Processor*","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/753974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1988","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation Of Chirp Z-Transform Using A Cordic Processor*","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00753974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039804S","chronDate":"1988","isNumber":"16283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081","articleId":"753974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":753992,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

Fuses exhibit excellent current limitation, but work only for a single shot. Circuit breakers are multi-operation devices, but allow several periods of the short circuit current to pass. Based on new PTC materials (positive temperature coefficient of resistance), we propose a new current limiting device for MV applications, which offers the chance to combine the advantages of fuses with the advantages of circuit breakers: a fast current limitation with a repetitive operation. The active material consists of conducting particles in a polymeric matrix. Its challenging property is a change on resistivity by eight to ten orders of magnitude upon temperature increase. This allows the limitation of available short circuit currents in a stable insulating state for a long period of time. The device consists of a series connection of PTC resistors with varistor elements connected in parallel, which serve for a perfect voltage distribution. Using this principle, repetitive current limitation of prospective currents of 4 to 14 kA within about 1 ms could be demonstrated at circuit voltages up to 12 kV.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel medium voltage fault current limiter based on polymer PTC resistors","doi":"10.1109/61.754084","startPage":"425","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.754084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/16289/00754084.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Novel medium voltage fault current limiter based on polymer PTC resistors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6218001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel medium voltage fault current limiter based on polymer PTC resistors","sourcePdf":"00754084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"34","articleId":"754084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":754090,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

Passive filter techniques employ tuned L-C filters at dominant 11th and 13th harmonic frequencies. However, they also require 5th and 7th tuned filters to avoid series and parallel resonance conditions. State of the art active filtering solutions require high bandwidth and relatively large rating PWM inverters for harmonic filtering of 12 pulse rectifier loads. Thus existing passive and active harmonic filtering solutions are not cost-effective for high power 12 pulse rectifier loads. Dominant harmonic active filter (DHAF) based on square-wave inverters is proposed to cost-effectively meet IEEE 519 harmonic current limits for 12 pulse rectifier loads. The proposed DHAF system employs square-wave inverters switching at 5th and 7th harmonic frequencies, which are transformer coupled in series with 11th and 13th passive filters respectively. The square-wave inverters are controlled to provide 'harmonic isolation' between the supply and load at 5th and 7th harmonic frequencies. The square-wave inverters are rated 1%-2% of the load kVA rating. The proposed DHAF system eliminates the need for large kVAR rated and bulky 5th and 7th passive filters, delivers superior harmonic filtering performance, and provides cost-effective harmonic filtering solution. Simulation results are given to validate the 'harmonic isolation' feature at 5th and 7th harmonic frequencies, and also demonstrate harmonic filtering required to meet IEEE 519 harmonic current limits.","doi":"10.1109/61.754112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.754112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16289","startPage":"642","endPage":"647","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel4/61/16289/00754112.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Active filters","Filtering","Passive filters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Band pass filters","Frequency","Rectifiers","Pulse inverters","Pulse transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","power harmonic filters","load (electric)","invertors","power conversion harmonics","rectifying circuits","control system synthesis","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dominant harmonic active filter system","12 pulse nonlinear loads","harmonic filtering","12 pulse rectifier-utility interface","IEEE 519 harmonic current limits","passive filter techniques","active filtering","square-wave inverters","7th harmonic frequency","5th harmonic frequency","harmonic isolation","superior harmonic filtering performance","controller design","feedforward","feedback","DC bus voltage control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of dominant harmonic active filter system with 12 pulse nonlinear loads","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6218028","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754112/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of dominant harmonic active filter system with 12 pulse nonlinear loads","sourcePdf":"00754112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044307S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"28","articleId":"754112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":754113,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.F.

Data have been collected for personnel and vehicles moving near a seismic sensor, and processed to allow two features to be obtained. An EM algorithm is used to estimate parameters of a Gaussian mixture model representing the signal data, resulting in improved detection and classification compared to the sensor's built-in algorithm. A design is given for multisensor fusion of a set of UGS sensors, in which multiple detections by a single sensor are used to estimate the closest distance of the target to the sensor, based on an assumption about the target speed, and these estimates are associated to a set of predefined trajectories which the target is assumed to follow. A multiple hypothesis scheme is used to update the probabilities of the trajectories as the target moves past the sensors through the region under surveillance.","doi":"10.1109/IDC.1999.754194","publicationTitle":"1999 Information, Decision and Control.

In this scheme, the controller uses the system error, the integral of the system error, and the derivative of the system error as its inputs, but the mapping from the inputs to the output is nonlinear. The corresponding nonlinear mapping may be specified based on the control requirement. Therefore, the proposed controller is defined as a generalized nonlinear PID controller (GNPIDC). The GNPIDC strategy is realized using neural networks. For online training of the neural network based GNPIDC, a PID gradient descent optimizing algorithm with momentum term is proposed. Then, the convergent characteristic of the algorithm is presented. Finally, simulation study of applying the neural GNPIDC strategy to a continuous-stirred-tank-reactor and a van de Vusse reactor is illustrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"8-10 Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6259263","displayDocTitle":"Generalised nonlinear PID controller based on neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalised nonlinear PID controller based on neural networks","confLoc":"Adelaide, SA, Australia","sourcePdf":"00754210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054236S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6082","citationCount":"1","articleId":"754210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":754299,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The first measures subject responses to pulse inputs to test whether sampling is enforced by an input-triggered clock (such as a forced oscillator) or whether the sample period is determined by the time to process each movement, during which no further input is accepted. The second tests whether sampling is dependent on the direction of the target by giving successive steps in the same or opposite directions. It is found that the sampling does not appear to be enforced by a clock, and that the existence of a sampled response and its duration are direction dependent. it is hoped that these and future experiments, combined with results in the physiology literature, will produce a comprehensive model of the sampling mechanism.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1988.754299","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00754299.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784/15433/00754299.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1988.754299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Efforts Toward Understanding The Sampling Phenomenon In Hand Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1988","displayDocTitle":"New Efforts Toward Understanding The Sampling Phenomenon In Hand Tracking","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1988","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Efforts Toward Understanding The Sampling Phenomenon In Hand Tracking","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00754299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026767S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1988","isNumber":"15433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784","articleId":"754299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":754327,"authors":[{"name":"Fuchuan Sun","affiliation":["Neurology and Telerobotics Unit, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"lastName":"Fuchuan Sun","id":"37087146189"},{"name":"L.

These models are made up of many simple nodes which are highly interconnected such that computation takes place as data flows amongst the nodes of the network. To present, most models have proposed nodes based on simple analog functions, where inputs are multiplied by weights and summed, the total then optionally being transformed by an arbitrary function at the node. Learning in these systems is accomplished by adjusting the weights on the input lines. This paper discusses the use of digital (boolean) nodes as a primitive building block in connectionist systems. Digital nodes naturally engender new paradigms and mechanisms for learning and processing in connectionist networks. The digital nodes are used as the basic building block of a class of models called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems). These models combine massive parallelism with the ability to adapt in a self-organizing fashion. Basic features of standard neural network learning algorithms and those proposed using digital nodes are compared and contrasted. The latter mechanisms can lead to vastly improved efficiency for many applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1988.754391","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00754391.png","startPage":"681","endPage":"684","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784/15433/00754391.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1988.754391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Computer networks","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Computer science","Application software","Data flow computing","Adaptive systems","Computer architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Aug 1988","displayDocTitle":"Digital Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Aug. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Neural Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00754391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032527S","chronDate":"8-12 Aug 1988","isNumber":"15433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784","citationCount":"2","articleId":"754391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":754418,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeounsoo Kim","affiliation":["Korea Telecom"],"lastName":"Kyeounsoo Kim","id":"37367184900"},{"name":"Jong-Seog Koh","affiliation":["Korea Telecom"],"lastName":"Jong-Seog Koh","id":"37366132300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"754418","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":250},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Hardware","Circuits","Timing","Clocks","Very large scale integration","Transform coding","Costs","Matrix decomposition","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","transform coding","code standards","telecommunication standards","VLSI","discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area efficient DCT architecture","MPEG-2 video encoder","VLSI architecture","transform coding module","2D DCT","2D IDCT","alternate scan conversion circuits","zigzag scan conversion circuits","hardware cost","performance","row-column decomposition","matrix transposition memory","timing controls","processing sequence schedules","PAL image format","NTSC image format","clocks","processing time reduction","3-bit serial distributed arithmetic method","hardware resources","ASIC chips","multimedia services","low hardware complexity","CMOS","54 MHz","0.5 micron"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an area efficient VLSI architecture of transform coding module for MPEG-2 video encoder. This module consists of 2-D DCT and 2-D IDCT, Q and IQ, and zigzag and alternate scan conversion circuits. Hardware cost and performance of this module are mainly affected by the 2-D DCT and 2-D IDCT. In the proposed architecture, it is shown that a single 1-D DCT/IDCT could take the roles of the 2-D DCT and 2-D IDCT. It is capable of reusing a single 1-D DCT/IDCT four times. It is based on the row-column decomposition technique. It can be achieved through precise timing schedules. Intuitively, three 1-D DCT/IDCT and a matrix transposition memory could be saved as compared to the conventional architectures, which usually use two one-dimensional transforms and transposition memory. Even though there are some extra circuits due to timing controls and processing sequence schedules, this architecture takes about 24% and 50% respectively less area than the architectures published by Miyazaki et al. (1993) and by Matsiu et al. (1994). This design and implementation are applicable to the MPEG-2 video encoder accepting NTSC and PAL image formats in which the number of clocks to be allocated during a macro block period is 1320 for 54 MHz operating clock. To reduce its processing time, the proposed architecture uses a 3-bit serial distributed arithmetic method. As a result, this architecture can be characterized to maximize the utilization of the hardware resources, end can be used for encoders having a similar structure as the MPEC-2 video encoder. It also can be applied to the ASIC chips for multimedia services especially requiring low hardware complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area efficient DCT architecture for MPEG-2 video encoder","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.754418","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/16290/00754418.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.754418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"An area efficient DCT architecture for MPEG-2 video encoder","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6223059","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area efficient DCT architecture for MPEG-2 video encoder","sourcePdf":"00754418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032048S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"21","articleId":"754418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":754419,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering & Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Wang","id":"37367889500"},{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering & Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Qian Chen","id":"37308112500"},{"name":"Baeomin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering & Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Baeomin Zhang","id":"37366698300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"754419","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":617,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3772},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image enhancement","Histograms","Probability density function","Pixel","Digital images","Image segmentation","Statistical distributions","Large-scale systems","Dynamic range","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","image enhancement","image segmentation","probability","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","video system","PDF","simulation result","probability density function","luminance","image enhancement","histogram equalization method","equal area dualistic sub-image"]}],"abstract":"Histogram equalization is a simple and effective image enhancing technique. But in some conditions, the luminance of an image may be changed significantly after the equalizing process, this is why it has never been utilized in a video system in the past. A novel histogram equalization technique, equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization, is put forward in this paper. First, the image is decomposed into two equal area sub-images based on its original probability density function. Then the two sub-images are equalized respectively. Finally, we obtain the results after the processed sub-images are composed into one image. The simulation results indicate that the algorithm can not only enhance the image information effectively but also preserve the original image luminance well enough to make it possible to be used in a video system directly.","doi":"10.1109/30.754419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/30/16290/00754419.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.754419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image enhancement based on equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Image enhancement based on equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754419/","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6223060","volume":"45","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image enhancement based on equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization method","sourcePdf":"00754419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027054S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"617","articleId":"754419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":754420,"authors":[{"name":"Eung Tae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Eung Tae Kim","id":"37308655800"},{"name":"Hyung-Myung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung-Myung Kim","id":"37280363700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"754420","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Parameter estimation","Motion compensation","Cameras","Motion estimation","Video coding","Image sequences","Motion detection","Least squares methods","Flowcharts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","motion compensation","motion estimation","parameter estimation","image sequences","feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust parameter estimation method","fast parameter estimation","global motion compensation","video coder","3D camera motion","image sequences","video coding system","estimation accuracy","global motion parameter","robust algorithm","reliable observation points","linear recursive algorithms","feature matching error","experimental results","coding efficiency","computation time reduction"]}],"abstract":"We describe a method for estimating and compensating 3D camera motion in image sequences for applications to a video coding system.

The authors have developed a method of reducing aliasing by increasing the resolution of color signals in DSCs that use a single-plate charge coupled device (CCD) with a primary color filter array. The new method interpolates signals by taking advantage of the fact that color signal variations are similar to one another in a local region of an image. It selects the signal that shows the higher correlation, either in the horizontal or vertical directions, at color signal positions subject to interpolation, thus improving the color resolution. First, the effectiveness of the new method was verified using image simulation. Next, the prototype hardware was fabricated. The prototype is fitted with an original reduced instruction set computer (RISC) built-in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) for processing image signals to provide high-speed camera signal processing.

However, the acetabular coverage of the femoral head is a complex three-dimensional (3D) structure. Thus conventional two-dimensional (2D) measurements using anteroposterior (AP) radiograph provide limited information about the contact area between the acetabulum and the femoral head. The authors developed a method for the solid angle estimation of the acetabular coverage of the femoral head in 3D space. The superior half of the femoral head is modeled as part of a sphere, and the tangent lines connecting from a set of points of the acetabular outline to the center of the fitted sphere are obtained. The lines pass through the unit sphere whose center is the same as that of the femoral head. With the points on the unit sphere, the authors calculate the covered area of the femoral head and estimate the solid angle. In this measurement, the solid angle of normal subjects is on an average 4.308 (rad) and the corresponding acetabular coverage is 68.3%. The solid angle is a new concept in comparison with the conventional 2D parameters such as CE and AC angles. Since acetabular coverage itself is 3D structure, solid angle will be more appropriate parameter in evaluating acetabular coverage.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.754565","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Conventional methods based on cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images have difficulty in determining the major axes: femoral neck axis, condylar line and longitudinal axis. The authors modeled the femur and defined three parameters: neck axis, long axis and knee axis. First, the neck axis consists of centers of femoral head and neck. The femoral head is modeled as a sphere. The authors define the center of femoral head from the center of fitted sphere. The center of femoral neck is the mid-point of the two dimensional (2D) reconstructed oblique image in the part of femoral neck. The neck axis is a line connecting these two centers. Second, the authors model the longitude of the femur as a cylinder, and the long axis is defined from the fitted cylinder. Third, the knee axis which is tangent to the back of the femoral condyles is easily determined by table-top method. According to the definition of the femoral anteversion, the femoral anteversion is efficiently measured from this model. The method provides accurate, fast and human factor free measurement for femoral anteversion.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In this paper, an incipient fault detection scheme using a neural network is presented. An incipient fault within a motor usually affects its performance. Factors such as conductive contamination, loose hardware, design defects, worn bearings, abnormal operation, aging and disturbance can cause damage to the motor. The symptoms of the faults are usually reflected by changes in parameter values and the steady-state operating condition of the motor. The neural network is basically a software (or hardware) implementation of parallel computing which identifies different input patterns and generates appropriate outputs. Data is collected on the parameters and state values of the motor under different fault conditions. Based on these data, a neural network is then implemented to perform incipient fault detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1988.754641","pdfPath":"/iel4/6081/16284/00754641.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"709","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00754641.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1988.754641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incipient Fault Detection In DC Machines Using A Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1988","displayDocTitle":"Incipient Fault Detection In DC Machines Using A Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incipient Fault Detection In DC Machines Using A Neural Network","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00754641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028335S","chronDate":"1988","isNumber":"16284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081","citationCount":"10","articleId":"754641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":754649,"authors":[{"name":"J.V.

In order to design high powerful architecture, we have been testing this functional approach quite extensively and special purpose circuits have already been developed. Finally from a broad class of various image processing algorithms and operators, we have defined a computational unit called functional element. These elements is to be associated in order to form a mesh connected programmable data flow computer. This data flow computer had been defined in order to get a straight mapping of the expressed algorithms thanks to the functionnal programming proposed by BACKUS. Thus, high computing power can be easily obtained for real time complex image processing applications. Using the equivalent data flow graphs of the algorithms, this computer can help to determine whether a given combination of precisely specified IC operators would have the requested behaviour, so that special purpose VLSI could be easily designed. In this paper the approach will be described shortly as well as the programmable data flow computer we defined. Several examples of implementation onto this computer are shown in order to point out the salient concept and advantages of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1988.754652","publicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty-Second Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/6081/16284/00754652.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1988.754652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16284","startPage":"758","endPage":"761","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00754652.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional VLSI Design For Low Level Image Processing ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Functional VLSI Design For Low Level Image Processing ICs","chronOrPublicationDate":"1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754652/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1988","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional VLSI Design For Low Level Image Processing ICs","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00754652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028738S","chronDate":"1988","isNumber":"16284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6081","articleId":"754652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":754660,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The elimination of constraints is achieved by specifying a blocking matrix whose columns form a basis orthogonal to the constraints.

Consequently, the capacity of the system in terms of maximum sustainable concurrent sessions is limited by the performance of the video server hardware. This paper proposes and analyzes the performance of a novel parallel video server architecture where video data are striped across an array of autonomous servers. The architecture allows one to build incrementally scalable video servers without video data replication. The proposed concurrent-push scheduling algorithm allows the system to integrate with quality of service guarantees provided by today's switching networks. In this paper, the striping policy, the service model, and the concurrent-push scheduling algorithm are presented. A system model is constructed to quantify three performance metrics, namely, server buffer requirement, client buffer requirement, and system response time. Results show that a simple extension of the server-push service model does not perform well under the parallel video server architecture. To improve system performance, a novel extension of the grouped sweeping scheme called the asynchronous grouped sweeping scheme (AGSS) is introduced. To further increase the scalability of the architecture, a new subschedule striping scheme (SSS) is introduced. With the proposed AGSS and SSS, our parallel video server architecture can be scaled up to more than 10000 concurrent users.","doi":"10.1109/76.754776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16298","startPage":"467","endPage":"477","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16298/00754776.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.754776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent push-A scheduling algorithm for push-based parallel video servers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Network servers","Video sharing","Video on demand","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","System performance","Scalability","Lifting equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video servers","quality of service","video on demand","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent push","scheduling algorithm","push-based parallel video servers","single server","maximum sustainable concurrent sessions","performance","autonomous servers","incrementally scalable video servers","quality of service guarantees","switching networks","striping policy","service model","system model","server buffer requirement","client buffer requirement","system response time","server-push service model","grouped sweeping scheme","asynchronous grouped sweeping scheme","subschedule striping scheme","video on demand"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent push-A scheduling algorithm for push-based parallel video servers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6237995","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent push-A scheduling algorithm for push-based parallel video servers","sourcePdf":"00754776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031585S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","articleId":"754776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":754778,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Many international standards such as JPEG, MPEG, and H.261 are based on a block-DCT scheme. High compression ratios are obtained by discarding information about DCT coefficients that is considered to be less important. The major drawback is visible discontinuities along block boundaries, commonly referred to as blocking artifacts. These often limit the maximum compression ratios that can be achieved. Various postprocessing techniques have been published that reduce these blocking effects, but most of them introduce unnecessary blurring, ringing, or other artifacts. In this paper, a novel postprocessing algorithm based on Markov random fields (MRFs) is proposed. It efficiently removes blocking effects while retaining the sharpness of the image and without introducing new artifacts. The degraded image is first segmented into regions, and then each region is enhanced separately to prevent blurring of dominant edges. A novel texture detector allows the segmentation of images containing both texture and monotone areas. It finds all texture regions in the image before the remaining monotone areas are segmented by an MRF segmentation algorithm that has a new edge component incorporated to detect dominant edges more reliably. The proposed enhancement stage then finds the maximum a posteriori estimate of the unknown original image, which is modeled by an MRF and is therefore Gibbs distributed. A very efficient implementation is presented. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed postprocessor gives excellent results compared to other approaches, from both a subjective and an objective viewpoint. Furthermore, it will be shown that our technique also works for wavelet encoded images, which typically contain ringing artifacts.","doi":"10.1109/76.754778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/16298/00754778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.754778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16298","startPage":"490","endPage":"500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of blocking artifacts in image and video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of blocking artifacts in image and video coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6237997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of blocking artifacts in image and video coding","sourcePdf":"00754778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045698S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"63","articleId":"754778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":754781,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper shows that, when the active nodes are provided with a number of optical receivers/transmitters equal to the number of wavelengths, routing without buffers, known as hot-potato [1], in conjunction with full wavelength conversion becomes an interesting option to solve contentions in packet switching WRONs with regular meshed topologies, such as Manhattan Street (MS) network and ShuffleNet (SN). We analytically compare three implementations of the access function: (1) local arrivals are centrally managed with tunable transmitters, (2) local arrivals are centrally managed with fixed transmitters, and (3) local arrivals are evenly split among fixed, independently managed transmitters. The analysis shows that the simpler access scheme (3), surprisingly, gives better throughput/delay results at high loads than the centrally managed schemes. Results also indicate that, by using more than four wavelengths, a 64-node MS or SN network can work at full load with a delay which is within one hop of its lowest achievable value. The probability of deflection can be made quite low by increasing the number of wavelengths. Another interesting finding is that delay-line optical buffers at the node are a much more effective way of solving contentions than using wavelength conversion: four or more wavelengths are needed in nodes without buffers and with wavelength conversion to match the performance of nodes with one delay-line optical buffer per wavelength and without wavelength conversion. However, optical buffers increase the accumulation of intraband crosstalk and amplified spontaneous emission noise, while wavelength conversion can provide noise suppression and signal reshaping. Hence, in WRONs with a small number of wavelengths, and when the transmission is feasible, it may be preferable to use optical buffers without wavelength conversion. On the other extreme, buffers are not needed with a large number of wavelengths and with full wavelength conversion.","doi":"10.1109/50.754781","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/16299/00754781.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.754781","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of hot-potato optical networks with wavelength conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of hot-potato optical networks with wavelength conversion","volume":"17","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6228443","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of hot-potato optical networks with wavelength conversion","sourcePdf":"00754781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041479S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"50","articleId":"754781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":754783,"authors":[{"name":"O.

To this end, we discuss a method of minimizing the total power dissipation of an interconnect link at a given bit rate. We examine the impact on the link performance of two competing transmitter technologies, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and multiple quantum-well (MQW) modulators and their associated driver-receiver circuits including complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and bipolar transmitter driver circuits, and p-n junction photodetectors with multistage transimpedance receiver circuits. We use the operating bit-rate and on-chip power dissipation as the main performance measures. Presently, at high bit rates (>800 Mb/s), optimized links based on VCSELs and MQW modulators are comparable in terms of power dissipation. At low bit rates, the VCSEL threshold power dominates. In systems with high bit rates and/or high fan-out, a high slope efficiency is more important for a VCSEL than a low threshold current. The transmitter driver circuit is an important component in a link design, and it dissipates about the same amount of power as that of the transmitter itself. Scaling the CMOS technology from 0.5 /spl mu/m down to 0.1 /spl mu/m brings a 50% improvement in the maximum operating bit rate, which is around 4 Gb/s with 0.1 /spl mu/m CMOS driver and receiver circuits. Transmitter driver circuits implemented with bipolar technology support a much higher operating bandwidth than CMOS technology; they dissipate, however, about twice the electrical power. An aggregate bandwidth in excess of 1 Tb/s-cm/sup 2/ can be achieved in an optimized free-space optical interconnect system using either VCSELs or MQW modulators as its transmitters.","doi":"10.1109/50.754783","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/16299/00754783.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.754783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power minimization and technology comparisons for digital free-space optoelectronic interconnections","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Power minimization and technology comparisons for digital free-space optoelectronic interconnections","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6228445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power minimization and technology comparisons for digital free-space optoelectronic interconnections","sourcePdf":"00754783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058554S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"47","articleId":"754783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":754785,"authors":[{"name":"D.

More specifically, they propose a new adaptive notch filter whose dynamic equations exhibit the following remarkable features: 1) all signals are globally bounded and the estimated frequency is asymptotically correct for all initial conditions and all frequency values; 2) the authors obtain a simple tuning procedure for the estimator design parameters, which trades-off the adaptation tracking capabilities with noise sensitivity, ensuring (exponential) stability of the desired orbit; and 3) transient performance is considerably enhanced, even for small or large frequencies, as witnessed by extensive simulations. To reveal some of the stability-instability mechanisms of the existing algorithms and motivate our modifications the authors make appeal to a novel nonlinear (state-dependent) time scaling. The main advantage of working in the new time scale is that they remove the coupling between the parameter update law and the filter itself, decomposing the system into a feedback form where the required modifications to ensure stability become apparent. Even though they limit their attention here to the simplest case of a single constant frequency without noise the algorithm is able to track time-varying frequencies, preserve local stability in the presence of multiple sinusoids, and is robust with respect to noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/16302/00754808.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.754808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.754808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A globally convergent frequency estimator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Robust stability","Adaptive filters","Equations","Tuning","Parameter estimation","Signal design","Asymptotic stability","Feedback","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning","notch filters","adaptive filters","filtering theory","frequency estimation","convergence","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["globally convergent frequency estimator","online estimation","sinusoidal signal","adaptive notch filter","simple tuning procedure","estimator design parameters","adaptation tracking capabilities","noise sensitivity","exponential stability","transient performance","stability-instability mechanisms","time scaling","parameter update law","local stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"A globally convergent frequency estimator","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6222836","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A globally convergent frequency estimator","sourcePdf":"00754808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031718S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"248","articleId":"754808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":754809,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Schematic circuits are proposed for representative cases and implementation issues are discussed. Exponential convergence is established for a fixed-point computation that determines the stationary probability vector for a Markov chain. A fixed-point formulation of the single source shortest path problem (SPP) that will always converge to the exact shortest path is described. A proposed implementation, on a 2-/spl mu/ complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, for a fully connected eight-node network is described in detail.

In consequence, the representation proposed uses the minimum number of parameters. The basis functions are obtained recursively by multiple compositions of a unique generating function /spl gamma/, resulting in several types of nested absolute-value functions. It is shown that the representation in a domain in R/sup n/ requires functions up to nesting level n.

A discussion of static and dynamic constraints which imply class AB operation, along with a basic theorem, leads to more practical constraints on the state space formulation which will allow class AB externally linear behavior of a system. Next, the results are used to explain the operation of several already-existing basic class AB log domain and exponential state-space filters.

The aim of such systems is to enable retrieval of images based on their contents. As part of our research in this area, we are building a prototype content-based image retrieval system called CHITRA. This uses a four-level data model, and we have defined a fuzzy object query language (FOQL) for this system. This system enables retrieval based on high-level concepts, such as \"retrieve images of mountains and sunset\". A problem faced in this system is the processing of complex queries such as \"retrieve all images that have a similar color histogram and a similar texture to the given example image\". Such problems have attracted research attention in recent times. R. Fagin (1996) has given an algorithm for processing such queries and provided a probabilistic upper bound for the complexity of the algorithm (which has been implemented in IBM's Garlic project). In this paper, we provide a theoretical (probabilistic) analysis of the expected cost of this algorithm. We propose a new multi-step query processing algorithm and prove that it performs better than Fagin's algorithm in all cases. Our algorithm requires fewer database accesses. We have evaluated both algorithms against an image database of 1000 images on our CHITRA system. We have used both color histogram and Gabor texture features. Our analysis is presented and the reported experimental results validate our algorithm (which has a significant performance improvement).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754894/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6233134","conferenceDate":"23-26 March 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Query processing issues in image (multimedia) databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Query processing issues in image (multimedia) databases","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"00754894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071228S","chronDate":"23-26 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6088","citationCount":"110","articleId":"754894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":754913,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawei Han","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"lastName":"Jiawei Han","id":"37087148812"},{"name":"Guozhu Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"lastName":"Guozhu Dong","id":"37087208251"},{"name":"Yiwen Yin","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada"],"lastName":"Yiwen Yin","id":"37087915877"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0071-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"}],"articleNumber":"754913","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754913","abstract":"Partial periodicity search, i.e., search for partial periodic patterns in time-series databases, is an interesting data mining problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly consider finding full periodic patterns, where every point in time contributes (precisely or approximately) to the periodicity. However, partial periodicity is very common in practice since it is more likely that only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. We present several algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns, by exploring some interesting properties related to partial periodicity such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property, and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hit set property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of all frequent patterns from a relatively small subset of patterns existing in the time series. We show that mining partial periodicity needs only two scans over the time series database, even for mining multiple periods. The performance study shows our proposed methods are very efficient in mining long periodic patterns.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.1999.754913","startPage":"106","endPage":"115","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 15th International Conference on Data Engineering (Cat.

Due to the dimensionality curse problem, transformations are applied to time series to reduce the number of dimensions of the feature vectors. Different transformations like Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be applied. While the use of DFT and K-L transform or SVD have been studied on the literature, to our knowledge, there is no in-depth study on the application of DWT. In this paper we propose to use Haar Wavelet Transform for time series indexing. The major contributions are: (1) we show that Euclidean distance is preserved in the Haar transformed domain and no false dismissal will occur, (2) we show that Haar transform can outperform DFT through experiments, (3) a new similarity model is suggested to accommodate vertical shift of time series, and (4) a two-phase method is proposed for efficient n-nearest neighbor query in time series databases.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 15th International Conference on Data Engineering (Cat.

Due to the multipath tolerance of the OFDM scheme, the receiver is able to combine signals coming from several transmitters, despite of the varying propagation delays, i.e., heavy artificial multipath propagation. In order to take full advantage of the diversity gain provided by the SFN architecture, proper network design is required. We focus on the cost efficient design of an SFN providing broadcasting services over a predefined service area with requirements both on the received signal quality and on the allowable interference level experienced by existing services in the same spectrum. We formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem, where the network design parameters such as power, antenna heights and transmitter locations are the decision variables. The general stochastic optimisation algorithm simulated annealing has been adapted for solving the above problem. The novelty of our method is that cost factors and interference constraints are embedded in the optimisation procedure. Through numerical examples we demonstrate that significant reduction in network cost can be achieved by our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal cost coverage planning for single frequency networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.754986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel4/11/16305/00754986.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.754986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=754986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Minimal cost coverage planning for single frequency networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6222914","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal cost coverage planning for single frequency networks","sourcePdf":"00754986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035566S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"48","articleId":"754986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":754987,"authors":[{"name":"V.

For any regular standard frequency plans (Europe, USA, NCTA, etc.) there is, for the I and Q components in the BB of the QAM channels, the harmonic series of the CSO/CTB with the first harmonic f/sub 1/. It has been shown that for all the same laser-optics or coaxial transmission systems the CSO/CTB distortions spectrum form in the QAM BB 60-80 /spl mu/s duration bursts of a series pulse with a pulse period T=1/f/sub 1/ and a pulse duration /spl tau//spl ap/0.4/f/sub m/, where f/sub m/ is the CSO/CTB harmonic with maximum amplitude in the QAM BB. The bursts result in the essential unevenness of error bits in time domain distribution. These bursts can deteriorate essential error correction by the interleaver-deinterleaver and Reed-Solomon (RS) forward error correction (FEC) code of the transmission systems also with a relative low bit error rate (BER) of about 10/sup -5/ before FEC.

Since strict optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are employed in incoherent optical fiber CDMA networks, their use can strictly guarantee the correlation constraint /spl lambda/ to be the minimum value (i.e., an unit \"1\") for multimedia applications. This is achieved without increasing any system complexity compared with the use of conventional OOCs. Moreover, optimal strict OOCs can have the same length as optimal conventional OOCs or a slightly longer length than the latter. It is shown that the proposed optical fiber CDMA networks have a distinguishing feature of high bit-rate flexibility and fast access tunability. Consequently, this can effectively support both VBR and CBR video communications as well as multimedia broadcasting/distributions in a given network without any violation of the minimum correlation constraint /spl lambda/=1. The proposed network can be also used as a backbone to interconnect various local-area networks with different data bit rates.

However, multicast transmission makes much more difficult the implementation of interactive functions for individual users and introduces start-up delays for the users, which contradicts the idea of on-demand services. In this paper, we first try to explore and evaluate the performance of different multicast VoD systems. A new scheme called single-rate multicast double-rate unicast (SRMDRU) is then developed to minimize the system resources for supporting full VCR functionality in a multicast VoD system. This scheme also allows multicast systems to support true VoD services so customers can be served as soon as the system receives the requests. Computer simulations show that the multicast systems using the SRMDRU scheme perform much better than other multicast systems in terms of system blocking probabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/754993/","volume":"45","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6222921","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of multicast delivery for providing VCR functionality in interactive video-on-demand systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multicast delivery for providing VCR functionality in interactive video-on-demand systems","sourcePdf":"00754993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046992S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"13","articleId":"754993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":754995,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The new measure finds applications in several fields of digital signal processing, including estimation of the extent of attack transients for filters with dynamically varying inputs, elimination of transients in variable recursive filters, and design and implementation of linear-phase IIR systems. A general definition and a simple algorithm to evaluate it are introduced, and closed-form expressions are derived for first and second-order all-pole filters. The effect of zeros on the effective length is analyzed. An upper bound for the effective length of higher-order filters is derived using results for low-order filters, which is illustrated for classical digital lowpass filters. The use of the measure is demonstrated with examples of implementation of linear-phase IIR systems and estimation of transients in variable IIR filters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-based effective length of the impulse response of a recursive filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.755042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel4/19/16325/00755042.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.755042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=755042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Energy-based effective length of the impulse response of a recursive filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6229701","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-based effective length of the impulse response of a recursive filter","sourcePdf":"00755042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101795S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"14","articleId":"755042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":755044,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

With a sliding correlator, a dynamic range of 25 dB was obtained with maximum Doppler bandwidth of 25 Hz and maximum excess delay of 19 /spl mu/s. Digital matched filtering with a maximum sampling rate of 125 MHz can be used in real-time measurements with Doppler shifts of several kilohertz and 30 dB dynamic range.

Propagation measurements collected in typical suburban environments have shown that each of these parameters, or its logarithm, is close to Gaussian.

To date, relatively little research has been done to characterize such wireless channels in order to determine the degree of sophistication required in the transmission hardware. This paper uses a ray-tracing propagation model to investigate the dispersive nature of the transmission channel in a typical urban environment. The results of this work show that highly directional antennas can effectively reduce channel dispersion so that high-speed digital transmission should be possible without requiring equalizers in the receivers. This research also suggests that intelligent use of stable reflection paths could provide an effective means of providing LMDS service to non line-of-sight locations.","doi":"10.1109/MTTTWA.1999.755138","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE MTT-S International Topical Symposium on Technologies for Wireless Applications (Cat.

This challenge mandates the use of unique packaging techniques such as multi-chip modules (MCM) that must not only provide the increase circuit density but also the reliability, electrical and medical performance, thermal management, and hermeticity. The interest in MCM technology has focused on different packaging technologies such as laminate, ceramic, and thin film technologies. One such ceramic technology, low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) tape technology, offers significant benefits over other established packaging technologies for high RF, high density and fast digital applications that could require hermetically and good thermal management. This paper addresses the current status of LTCC technology as well as new and promising developments that could make this the leading substrate and MCM packaging technology. All market indicators are predicting tremendous growth in the MCM market.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Feb. 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6337955","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LTCC technology: where we are and where we're going.

Particularly, when a demand side management system is taken into account on a deregulated energy market, the knowledge of load profiles is of the greatest importance. Forecasting of daily demand, based upon load models, uses comparable load research data for a different customer mix. For the given season and day of the week, the shape of a daily load curve depends mainly on the customer composition. Difficulties in defining objective customer classes significantly complicate the forecasting process. Usage of statistical clustering and neural network approaches makes possible to improve the load modelling accuracy. This paper presents load modelling methods useful for the long-term planning of power distribution systems. The theoretical statement is illustrated by examples which correspond to Polish and German distribution systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.1999.755372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16340","startPage":"320","endPage":"325 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Transmission and Distribution Conference (Cat.

The ANN provides a good estimate of the true (primary) current for a saturated transformer. The neural network is developed using MATLAB and trained using data from EMTP simulations, and data generated from actual CTs. In order to handle large dynamic ranges of fault currents, a technique of employing two sets of network coefficients is used. Different sets of network coefficients deal with different fault current ranges. The algorithm for running the network was implemented on an Analog Devices ADSP-2101 digital signal processor.

The method conducts singular value decomposition of the rule consequents and generates certain linear combinations of the original membership functions to form new ones for the reduced set. The present work characterizes membership functions by the conditions of sum normalization (SN), nonnegativeness (NN), and normality (NO). Algorithms to preserve the SN and NN conditions in the new membership functions are presented. Preservation of the NO condition relates to a high-dimensional convex hull problem and is not always feasible in which case a closed-to-NO solution may be sought. The proposed method is applicable regardless of the adopted inference paradigms. With product-sum-gravity inference and singleton support fuzzy rule base, output errors between the full and reduced fuzzy set are bounded by the sum of the discarded singular values. The work discusses three specific applications of fuzzy reduction: fuzzy rule base with singleton support, fuzzy rule base with nonsingleton support (which includes the case of missing rules), and the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model.

Two examples are used to show the design method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/16368/00755400.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.755400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.755400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=755400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of fuzzy control systems using dynamic fuzzy-state space models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Stability","Linear systems","Design methodology","Fuzzy systems","Adaptive control","Sufficient conditions","Linear feedback control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","state feedback","discrete time systems","asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","control system analysis","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fuzzy-state space models","discrete-time fuzzy control system","dynamic fuzzy model","sufficient conditions","uncertain linear system theory","stability condition","state feedback matrix","local rule map","global stability","nonlinear analysis method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of fuzzy control systems using dynamic fuzzy-state space models","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6231664","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of fuzzy control systems using dynamic fuzzy-state space models","sourcePdf":"00755400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034639S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"93","articleId":"755400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":755401,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To be able to do so, we develop a model that captures the dynamics of the integrator inside the modulator. Based on this model, power dissipation for various op amp topologies is computed and compared with each other. We show that class-A op amps can consume one to six times the current consumed by an idealized class-AB op amp, though the savings for practical class-AB op amps is likely to be lower. For high-resolution applications, class-A topologies are most optimal, while for lower resolution lower power applications, class-AB op amps may be more suitable. We further demonstrate a design strategy with the help of an example that can be used to minimize the power dissipation for class-A op amps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power dissipation","Voltage","Delta modulation","Topology","Filters","Feedback","Circuits","Data acquisition","Consumer electronics","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","operational amplifiers","circuit optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design optimization","opamp","oversampled A/D converter","power dissipation","class-AB op amp","class-A op amp","SC integrator model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/82.755407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/16367/00755407.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.755407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power analysis and optimal design of op amps for oversampled converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=755407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power analysis and optimal design of op amps for oversampled converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755407/","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6238036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power analysis and optimal design of op amps for oversampled converters","sourcePdf":"00755407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037367S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"16","articleId":"755407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":755409,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The first generation 21064 and the later 21164 raised expectations for the newest generation-performance leadership was again a goal of the 21264 design team. Benchmark scores of 30+ SPECint95 and 58+ SPECfp95 offer convincing evidence thus far that the 21264 achieves this goal and will continue to set a high performance standard. A unique combination of high clock speeds and advanced microarchitectural techniques, including many forms of out-of-order and speculative execution, provide exceptional core computational performance in the 21264. The processor also features a high-bandwidth memory system that can quickly deliver data values to the execution core, providing robust performance for a wide range of applications, including those without cache locality. The advanced performance levels are attained while maintaining an installed application base. All Alpha generations are upward-compatible.

Semantic conceptualization can be performed at several levels of information granularity, leading to multilevel indexing and searching mechanisms. Various models at different levels of granularity are compared. At the finest level of granularity, multimedia data can be indexed based on image contents, such as identification of objects and faces. At a coarser level of granularity, indexing of multimedia data can be focused on events and episodes, which are higher level abstractions. In light of the above, we also examine modeling and indexing techniques of multimedia documents.","doi":"10.1109/69.755616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/69/16382/00755616.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.755616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic modeling and knowledge representation in multimedia databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Semantic modeling and knowledge representation in multimedia databases","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6224150","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic modeling and knowledge representation in multimedia databases","sourcePdf":"00755616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078259S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1999","isNumber":"16382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"71","articleId":"755616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":755618,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, the frequency of the oscillations and the number of generators that oscillate in any electromechanical oscillatory mode depend on the structure of the power system network. Low frequency electromechanical oscillations occur when existing generation/load areas are connected to other similar areas by relatively weak transmission lines. Weak interconnections are obvious in many interconnected systems, for example, when two independent electric grids are interconnected for the first time through one or two tie lines. However, in systems that have been interconnected for some time, such as the US/Canadian interconnected systems, and that are being stressed by increased load, weak links are less obvious. Often, the first signs of trouble are low frequency oscillations becoming unstable. The connection between loading and stability is not always obvious. It is also unclear which contingencies may lead to oscillatory instability. This tutorial examines in detail the relationship between low frequency oscillations and weak interconnections in the transmission system network. The basis of the analysis is the observation that generators in specific areas of a power system behave coherently in low frequency oscillations and that groups of coherent generators are separated from other groups of coherent generators by weak interconnections. This observation is also the starting point for dynamic system reduction.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel4/67/16383/00755641.pdf","doi":"10.1109/67.755641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.755641","startPage":"14","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system structure and oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755641/","displayDocTitle":"Power system structure and oscillations","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6249158","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system structure and oscillations","sourcePdf":"00755641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018388S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"11","articleId":"755641","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":755642,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The reason for this is that a fuzzy controller can imitate human control processes closely. Fuzzy logic technology enables the use of engineering experience and experimental results in designing an embedded system. In many applications, this circumvents the use of rigorous mathematical modeling to derive a control solution. Another advantage of fuzzy logic control is that it allows for a model-free estimation of the system. In other words, the designer does not need to state how the outputs depend mathematically upon the inputs. A fuzzy controller can be developed by encoding the structured knowledge of the system, which will allow faster control algorithms to be developed in less time and at less cost. With the advance of microprocessors and digital signal processors (DSPs), fuzzy logic control techniques are becoming more attractive for real-time control problems. It is expected that it will be implemented in many power system control applications in the near future. The paper describes a fuzzy logic based closed loop control system which controls the armature voltage of a generator by varying its field current in real-time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755646/","volume":"12","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6249157","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based voltage controller for a synchronous generator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based voltage controller for a synchronous generator","sourcePdf":"00755646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041989S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"11","articleId":"755646","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":755648,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result, the receiver is often left with an incomplete description of the requested data. Multiple description source coding addresses the problem of minimizing the expected distortion caused by packet loss. An equivalent problem is that of source coding for data transmission over multiple channels where each channel has some probability of breaking down. Recent work in practical multiple description coding explores the design of multiple description scalar and vector quantizers for the case of two channels or packets. This paper presents a new practical algorithm, based on a ternary tree structure, for the design of both fixed- and variable-rate multiple description vector quantizers for an arbitrary number of channels. Experimental results achieved by codes designed with this algorithm show that they perform well under a wide range of packet loss scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1999.755648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1999.755648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16375","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC'99 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

In this work we tackle the related problem of compressing a source that is correlated with another source which is available only at the decoder. In contrast to prior information-theoretic approaches, we introduce a new construction and practical framework for tackling the problem based on the judicious incorporation of channel coding principles into this source coding problem. We dub our approach as distributed source coding using syndromes (DISCUS). We focus in this paper on trellis-structured constructions of the framework to illustrate its utility. Simulation results confirm the power of DISCUS, opening up a new and exciting constructive playing-ground for the distributed source coding problem. For the distributed coding of correlated i.i.d. Gaussian sources that are noisy versions of each other with \"correlation-SNR\" in the range of 12 to 20 dB, the DISCUS method attains gains of 7-15 dB in SNR over the Shannon-bound using \"naive\" independent coding of the sources.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Costs","Decoding","Channel coding","Gaussian noise","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed source coding using syndromes","DISCUS","correlated source compression","joint description cost","channel coding principles","trellis-structured constructions","Gaussian sources","Shannon-bound","naive independent coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=755665","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1999.755665","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC'99 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

In that way, PWC allows for progressive image encoding that is scalable both in resolution and bit rate, with a fully embedded bitstream.

However, on a number of typical moderate-motion sequences characterized by largely rigid motions, 3D SPIHT performs several dB worse than motion-compensated predictive coders, because it is does not take advantage of the real physical motion underlying the scene. We introduce global motion compensation for 3D subband video coders, and find 0.5 to 2 dB gain on sequences with dominant background motion.

The motivation for such data synchronization with timing is that in many situations where data must be encoded, it is not sufficient for the decoder to present a sequence of correct data symbols. Instead, the user also needs to know the position in the original source sequence of the symbols being presented. With this goal in mind, periodic prefix-synchronized (PPS) codes are introduced and analyzed on the basis of their synchronization delay D, rate R, and timing span T. Introduced are two specific PPS designs called natural marker and cascaded codes. A principal result is that when coding binary data with rate R, the largest possible timing span attainable with PPS codes grows exponentially with delay D, with exponent D(1-R). Thus, a large timing span can be attained with little redundancy and moderate values of delay.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC'99 Data Compression Conference (Cat.

Maximizing performance has been the conventional objective in the allocation of tasks for such systems. Inherently, distributed systems are more complex than centralized systems. The added complexity could increase the potential for system failures. Some work has been done in the past in allocating tasks to distributed systems, considering reliability as the objective function to be maximized. Reliability is defined to be the probability that none of the system components falls while processing. This, however, does not give any guarantees as to the behavior of the system when a failure occurs. A failure, not detected immediately, could lead to a catastrophe. Such systems are unsafe. In this paper, we describe a method to determine an allocation that introduces safety into a heterogeneous distributed system and at the same time attempts to maximize its reliability. First, we devise a new heuristic, based on the concept of clustering, to allocate tasks for maximizing reliability. We show that for task graphs with precedence constraints, our heuristic performs better than previously proposed heuristics. Next, by applying the concept of task-based fault tolerance, which we have previously proposed, we add extra assertion tasks to the system to make it safe. We present a new heuristic that does this in such a way that the decrease in reliability for the added safety is minimized.

For instance, short control messages may be sent with the lowest overhead on one type of network, such as Ethernet, while bulk data transfers may be better suited to a different type of network, such as Fibre Channel or HIPPI. This work investigates how to exploit multiple heterogeneous communication networks that interconnect the same set of processing nodes using a set of techniques we call performance-based path determination (PBPD). The performance-based path selection (PBPS) technique selects the best (lowest latency) network among several for each individual message to reduce the communication overhead of parallel programs. The performance-based path aggregation (PBPA) technique, on the other hand, aggregates multiple networks into a single virtual network to increase the available bandwidth. We test the PBPD techniques on a cluster of SGI multiprocessors interconnected with Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and HiPPI networks using a custom communication library built on top of the TCP/IP protocol layers. We find that PBPS can reduce communication overhead in applications compared to using either network alone, while aggregating networks into a single virtual network can reduce communication latency for bandwidth-limited applications. The performance of the PBPD techniques depends on the mix of message sizes in the application program and the relative overheads of the networks, as demonstrated in our analytical models.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"316","endPage":"327","doi":"10.1109/71.755832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.755832","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/16392/00755832.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance-based path determination for interprocessor communication in distributed computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/755832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Performance-based path determination for interprocessor communication in distributed computing systems","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1999","accessionNumber":"6230885","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance-based path determination for interprocessor communication in distributed computing systems","sourcePdf":"00755832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131109S","chronDate":"Mar 1999","isNumber":"16392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"6","articleId":"755832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":755844,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

RaPiDs can provide significantly higher performance than general purpose processors on a wide range of applications from the areas of video and signal processing, scientific computing and communications. Moreover, RaPiDs provide the flexibility that does not come with application-specific architectures. A RaPiD architecture is optimized for highly repetitive, computationally-intensive tasks. Very deep application-specific computation pipelines can be configured that deliver very high performance for a wide range of applications. RaPiDs achieve this using a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture that mixes the appropriate amount of static configuration with dynamic control. We describe the fundamental features of a RaPiD architecture, including the linear array of functional units, a programmable segmented bus structure, and a programmable control architecture. In addition, we outline the floorplan of the architecture and provide timing data for the most critical paths.

We developed these devices in standard double-poly CMOS technologies by utilizing many effects inherent in these processes. We add floating-gate charge by electron tunneling, and we remove floating-gate charge by hot-electron injection. With this floating-gate technology, we cannot only build analog EEPROMs, we can also implement adaptation and learning when we consider floating-gate devices to be circuit elements with important time-domain dynamics. We start by discussing non-adaptive properties of floating-gate devices and we present two representative non-adaptive applications. First, we discuss using the floating-gate pFETs as non-volatile voltage sources or potentiometers (e-pots). Second, we discuss using floating-gate pFETs to build translinear circuits that compute the product of powers of the input currents. We then discuss the physics, behavior, and applications of adaptation using floating-gate pFETs. The physics of adaptation starts with floating-gate pFETs with continuous tunneling and injection currents. A single floating-gate MOS device operating with continuous-time tunneling and injection currents can exhibit either stabilizing or destabilizing behaviors. One particular application is an autozeroing floating-gate amplifier (AFGA) that uses tunneling and pFET hot-electron injection to adaptively set its DC operating point. Continuous-time circuits comprising multiple floating-gate MOS devices show various competitive and cooperative behaviors between devices.

We see that over the past 20 years, the increased density of VLSI chips was applied to close the gap between microprocessors and high-end CPUs. Today this gap is fully closed and adding devices to uniprocessors is well beyond the point of diminishing returns. To continue to convert the increasing density of VLSI to computer performance we see little alternative to building multicomputers. We sketch the architecture of a VLSI multicomputer constructed from c. 2009 processor-DRAM chips and outline some of the challenges involved in building such a system. We suggest that the software transition from sequential processors to such fine-grain multicomputers can be eased by using the multicomputer as the memory system of a conventional computer.","doi":"10.1109/ARVLSI.1999.756051","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th Anniversary Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th Anniversary Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125/16373/00756051.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARVLSI.1999.756051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=756051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture: past, present, and future","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/756051/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture: past, present, and future","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-24 March 1999","accessionNumber":"6376068","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture: past, present, and future","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00756051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027547S","chronDate":"21-24 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125","citationCount":"41","articleId":"756051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":756056,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The two basic VLSI building blocks are a sender chip which incorporates a 2D imager array and transmits the position of moving spatial edges, and a receiver chip which computes a 2D optical flow vector field from the edge information. The elementary two-chip motion processing system consisting of a single sender and receiver is first characterized. Subsequently, two three-chip motion processing systems are described. The first such system uses two sender chips to compute the presence of motion only at a particular stereoscopic disparity. The second such system uses two receivers to simultaneously compute a linear and polar topographic mapping of the image plane, resulting in information about image translation, rotation, and expansion. These three-chip systems demonstrate the modularity and flexibility of the multi-chip neuromorphic approach.","doi":"10.1109/ARVLSI.1999.756056","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th Anniversary Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th Anniversary Conference on Advanced Research in VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/6125/16373/00756056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARVLSI.1999.756056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16373","startPage":"309","endPage":"323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-chip neuromorphic motion processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=756056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-chip neuromorphic motion processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Mar 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/756056/","conferenceDate":"21-24 March 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6376073","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-chip neuromorphic motion processing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00756056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036742S","chronDate":"21-24 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6125","citationCount":"20","articleId":"756056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":756064,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

Because of the faults and after isolating the fault, there are unfaulted sections which are left without supply. It is required to quickly restore supply to these unfaulted sections of the shipboard power systems.

Previous methods for source location either assumed the array consisted of widely separated subarrays, or used an iterative procedure that required a good initial estimate. The first method directly estimates the source location and propagation speed by converting the solution of a system of nonlinear equations to an overdetermined system of linear equations with two supplemental variables. The second method provides improved estimates by using the solution of the first method as the initial condition for further iteration. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) on the joint estimation is derived, and simulations show the new methods compare favorably to the bound.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756185","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The results developed are based on the definition of a discrete-time scaling (dilation) operator through a mapping between the discrete and continuous frequencies. The forward and inverse wavelet transforms are formulated. The admissibility condition is derived, and examples of discrete-time wavelet construction are provided. The new form of wavelet transform is naturally suited for discrete-time signals and provides analysis and synthesis of such signals over a continuous range of scaling factors.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

As discussed by Xia and Zhang (1993), for an orthogonal scaling function to support such a sampling theorem, the scaling function must be cardinal. They also showed that the only orthogonal scaling function that is both cardinal and of compact support is the Haar function, which has only 1 vanishing moment and is not continuous. This paper addresses the same question, but in the multiwavelet context, where the situation is different. This paper presents the construction of orthogonal multiscaling functions that are simultaneously cardinal, of compact support, and have more than one vanishing moment. The scaling functions thereby support a Shannon-like sampling theorem. Such wavelet bases are appealing because the initialization of the discrete wavelet transform (prefiltering) is the identity operator-the projection of a function onto the scaling space is given by its samples.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756195","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1212 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

To avoid the limitations inherent in the number theoretic Fourier transform over finite fields, our wavelet transform relies on a basis decomposition in the time domain rather than in the frequency domain. First, we characterize the infinite dimensional vector spaces for which an orthonormal basis expansion of any sequence in the space can be obtained using a symmetric bilinear form. Then, by employing a symmetric, non-degenerate, canonical bilinear form we derive the necessary and sufficient condition that basis functions over finite fields must satisfy in order to construct an orthogonal wavelet transform. Finally, we give a design methodology to generate the mother wavelet and scaling function over Galois fields by relating the wavelet transform to a two channel paraunitary filter bank.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The measure uses the entropy of the signal and its Fourier transform in a manner that is similar to the use of the signal and its Fourier transform in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The measure explains why the level of discretization of continuous basis signals can be very important to the compactness of representation. Our use of the measure indicates that a mixture of (non-orthogonal) sinusoidal and impulsive or \"blocky\" basis functions may be best for compactly representing signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

A particular choice of mother wavelet contains a fixed number, M, of cycles of a complex exponential, which provides a resolution of 1/M times T. The transform operates on interleaved guise sequences and, by thresholding, determines T for each component sequence. The detector is robust against missing pulses and timing jitter and is sensitive to simple, staggered and complex pulse sequences. The method is an improvement on other established approaches, such as the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) histogram and the periodogram.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Separation in the convolutive case requires an unmixing system which uses present and past values of the observation vector, when the mixing system is causal. Thus, in developing an infomax process, both temporal and spatial dependence of the observations must be considered. We propose a stochastic gradient based structure which accomplishes this task. The performance of the proposed method is verified by subjective listening tests and quantitative measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756252","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Hence, original voices or images (module permutation and linear scaling) are extracted from their mixtures without modeling the dynamics of the signals. The typical methods for performing blind source separation are linear independent component analysis (ICA) and the infomax method. Linear ICA directly penalizes a suitably chosen measure of the statistical dependence between the extracted signals. These measures are either obtained from the information theoretic postulates such as the mutual information or from the cumulant expansion of the associated probability density functions. The infomax method is based on the entropy maximization of the non-linear transformation of the separated signals. This paper analyzes extensions of the instantaneous blind source separation techniques to the case of linear dynamic signal mixtures. Furthermore, the paper introduces a novel method based on combining time delayed decorrelation (TDD) with the minimization of the cumulant cost function. TDD is used to obtain an acceptable initial condition for the cumulant based cost function optimization in order to reduce the numerical complexity of the latter method. This combined approach is illustrated on two examples including a real life cocktail party example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic signal mixtures and blind source separation","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

After whitening the sensor output, the separation is achieved by estimating an orthogonal transformation, which in the real-mixture two-source two-sensor case is entirely characterized by a single rotation angle. This contribution studies an estimator of such an angle. Even though it is derived from geometric notions based on the scatter-plots of the signals involved, it is found, empirically, to exhibit a performance clearly up to the mark of other methods based on optimality criteria and, theoretically, to improve and generalize one of such procedures. The simplicity of the suggested estimator results in a straightforward adaptive version, which converges regardless of the source distribution, for quite mild conditions, and whose asymptotic analysis is easy to carry out. The applicability of the estimator in a full separation system is also illustrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Closed-form expressions for the exact and large-sample Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) are derived. It is shown that the CRB is not significantly affected by the colour of the modulating process, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Hence, maximum likelihood type estimators which ignore the noise colour and optimize a criterion with respect to only the phase parameters are proposed. These estimators are shown to be equivalent to the nonlinear least squares estimators which consist of matching the squared observations with a constant amplitude phase modulated signal when the mean of the multiplicative noise is forced to zero. Closed-form expressions are derived for the efficiency of these estimators, and are verified via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756288","startPage":"1577","endPage":"1580 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

To this end, we introduce non-quadratic convex penalization functions, like in low level image processing.

Signal Processing Series. Prentice Hall PTR, New Jersey, 1995) class has significant potential for the analysis of a number of non-stationary signals. One of the discrete formulations is the recently introduced alias-free generalized discrete-time TFD (AF-GDTFD). The spectral decomposition of the kernel allows the computation of AF-GDTFD as a weighted sum of spectrograms. The partial sum has been shown to offer a vehicle to trade-off between exactness and computational load. This paper proposes a scheme which exploits local approximations by adapting dynamically the accuracy of spectrograms to the eigenvalue magnitudes. The approach employs the wavelet packet transform followed by a block-recursive Fourier transform and a compensation network. Adaptive selection of subbands for further processing reduces substantially the computational cost while still preserving an acceptable quality. The approach is attractive in terms of VLSI aspects due to the modular structure, local connections and stream processing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756325","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The design of a particular tapped-delay-line (demodulation) or piecewise-constant-impulse-response (modulation) equivalent filter determines both the actual implementation filters and system performance. The tap spacing of the former and the transition times of the latter are periodically nonuniform. Following a characterization of the equivalent filter response, the special case of second-order sampling is examined for insight into the choice of sampling offset. A set of example designs demonstrates that, while nonuniform sampling permits carrier frequencies not allowed with uniform sampling, the resulting system performance is limited by the choice of carrier frequency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756326","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Researchers in statistical signal processing and related disciplines have shown increased interest for a generator of random vectors with truncated multivariate normal probability density functions (PDFs). A straightforward method for their generation is to draw samples from the multivariate normal density and reject the ones that are outside the acceptance region. This method, which is known as rejection sampling, can be very inefficient, especially for high dimensions and/or relatively small supports of the random vectors. We propose an approach for generation of vectors with truncated Gaussian densities based on Gibbs sampling, which is simple to use and does not reject any of the generated vectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/756335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Mar 1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6364253","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Gibbs sampling approach for generation of truncated multivariate Gaussian random variables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gibbs sampling approach for generation of truncated multivariate Gaussian random variables","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00756335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028567S","chronDate":"15-19 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6110","citationCount":"22","articleId":"756335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":756336,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method applies to both the non-linear/non-Gaussian as well as linear/Gaussian model. The approach solves the required expectation over unknown random parameters by several one-dimensional integrals computed recursively, thus simplifying a computationally-intensive multi-dimensional integration. The method is applied to the problem of refractivity estimation using radar clutter from the sea surface, where the backscatter cross section is assumed to be a Markov process in range. The HCRLB is evaluated and compared to the performance of the corresponding maximum a-posteriori estimator. Simulation results indicate that the HCRLB provides a tight lower bound in this application.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.756336","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

This network is designed to control FES systems developed by the first author and that is presently in use by over 400 patients worldwide (presently without ANN control) and which is the first and the only FES system approved by FDA. The network that is considered discriminates patterns of above-lesion upper-trunk electromyographic (EMG) time series to map patient's posture for activating standing and walking functions under FES and it controls FES stimuli levels using response-EMG signals to overcome muscle fatigue. The neural network also adaptively controls patient's postural stability via identifying changes in posture through acceleration/gravitational/weight sensors. The network trains itself to adapt to physiological changes of the patient, and it overcomes decision and control errors by simple punishment inputs from a single manual punishment switch. The system thus, is both self adaptive and patient-responsive through a combinations of neural EMG signals and an artificial neural network to achieve patient responsive ambulation using stimulation of the patient's own peripheral motor neurons, namely his own peripheral neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct-2 Nov 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/756539/","accessionNumber":"6240565","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of neuromuscular stimulation in paraplegics for independent ambulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of neuromuscular stimulation in paraplegics for independent ambulation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00756539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032925S","chronDate":"30 Oct-2 Nov 1997","isNumber":"16334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6085","citationCount":"2","articleId":"756539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":756541,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In order to reduce computational complexity and the influence of noise in estimating single-trial evoked potential (EP), the number of hidden nodes is also minimized in training. After training, both peak latency and amplitude, being distinctive features of an EP, are characterized by center and height of the corresponding RBF respectively. In EP estimation, an adaptive algorithm is employed to track the peaks from trial to trial by adapting the center and height of RBFs directly.

Applying the FST-NST filter to fine/coarse crackles, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of crackles is revealed and they are separated from VS. The resulted separation is accurate, objective, and of a high quality, since the FTST-NST filter automatically identifies the true location of crackles in the original signal and maintains their structure in its nonstationary output.

First, a small set of wavelet coefficients is used to represent the characteristics of a single channel epileptic spike. The purpose of this WT is to reduce the number of inputs to the ANN. Next, three layer feedforward network employing the error backpropagation algorithm is trained and tested using parameters obtained by the WT. Finally, 16 channel expert system based on the context information of adjacent channels is introduced to reject artifacts and produce reliable results. In this study, epileptic spike and normal activities were selected from 32 patient's EEGs (seizure disorder: 12, normal: 20) in consensus among experts. The result was that the WT reduced data input size and the preprocessed ANN had 97% sensitivity and 89.5% selectivity, which were more accurate than that of ANN with the same input size of raw data. Our expert rule system was capable of rejecting a wide variety of artifacts commonly found in EEG recordings. It's average false detection rate was 5.5/h for ANN's threshold=0.65 and false detection was also a little decreased by high thresholds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16334","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1197 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

This assumption leads to root-mean-square (RMS) processing as the maximum likelihood estimator of the EMG amplitude. Contrary to this theoretical formulation, recent experimental work has found mean-absolute-value (MAV) processing to be superior to RMS. This paper reviews RMS processing with the Gaussian model and then derives the expected (inferior) performance of MAV processing with the Gaussian model. Next, a new model for the surface EMG waveform, using a Laplacian density, is presented. It is shown that the MAV processor is the maximum likelihood estimator of the EMG amplitude for the Laplacian model. Lastly, experimental data from isometric, constant-force, non-fatiguing contractions were examined. On average, the Laplacian density best fit the experimental data (although results varied with subject). For amplitude estimation, MAV processing was clearly superior to RMS processing.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756605","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The definitive method to identify seizures is based on the visual analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Reliable seizure detection in neonates can optimize clinical treatment and theoretically reduce brain injury. Most efforts in computerized, automated seizure detection have been directed towards adults and hence commercially available schemes are not specifically focused on neonatal seizure detection. As in adults, the normal spectrum of neonatal EEG follows an inverse power-law attenuation over a band of clinically relevant frequencies suggestive of self-similar fluctuations over a multiplicity of scales. In this paper, measures to monitor the scaling property of the neonatal EEG to detect electrographic seizures are proposed. This is achieved by multi-scale analysis of the signal using the wavelet transform as a tool. A seizure detection scheme which can be implemented on-line is proposed. The test set included data from five neonates of 36-42 weeks conceptional age. Preliminary tests on 18 channels of data from 5 patients yielded 95.9% seizure detection rate. The detection rate is 100% when the analysis is based on multichannel data.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16334","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1292 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Artificial neural networks play an important role in the detection of masses. Currently, features are extracted from potential lesion areas and sent through a neural network to decide whether the area is to be called a true lesion or a false detection. One of the most difficult aspects of dealing with artificial neural networks is to train them without over-training; in other words, to take both the bias and variance into account when training. Typically, an early stopping technique is employed; that is, the neural network is tested on an independent data set and training is stopped when the the performance on this independent data set is maximized. In this paper the effectiveness of regularization is evaluated as a technique to minimize over-training. Regularization adds an extra term to the cost-function used in neural network training that penalizes over-complex results. The results of simulation studies will be presented along with results obtained using data of actual lesions and false positives from the authors' computerized mass detection scheme.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756623","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1339 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Generally an LVAD system needs to compensate for nonlinearities. Hence, it is necessary to apply high performance control techniques. Fortunately, a neural network can be applied to the control of a nonlinear dynamic system by utilizing its learning capability. Here, the authors identify an LVAD system with Neural Network Identification (NNI). Once the NNI has learned the dynamic model of the LVAD system, another network, called Neural Network Controller (NNC), is designed for control of the LVAD system. The ability and effectiveness of identifying and controlling an LVAD system using the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756630","pdfPath":"/iel4/6085/16334/00756630.pdf","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1366 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The significance of this gradient is unclear: does the disease selectively interfere with the recall of recent memories, or does it prevent the memories from being adequately recorded? To address this question, neural networks were used to simulate learning over time. Once trained with a group of patterns, the networks were damaged to simulate the lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease. By altering the number of times a network was trained with a given pattern before additional patterns were added, and by varying the number of patterns in the training set, the direction of the temporal gradient was changed. The factors that determine the direction of the gradient are in place before the network is damaged. This suggests that the gradient associated with Alzheimer's disease is not a direct result of brain lesions that are hallmarks of the disease, but instead develops from an alteration of the learning process that begins long before dementia develops.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756631","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1370 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In contrast to x-ray and ultrasound modalities, the method reviewed here exploits the breast-tissue physical properties unique to the microwave spectrum, namely, the translucent nature of normal breast tissues and the high dielectric contrast between malignant and normal breast tissues. The system uses a confocal technique and time-gating to enhance the detection of malignant tumors while suppressing the effects of tissue heterogeneity and absorption. Using published data for the dielectric properties of normal and malignant breast tissues, we have conducted a preliminary 2-D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computational electromagnetics analysis of the system. We considered two types of inhomogeneities of normal tissue: a statistically random variation of the dielectric parameters throughout the breast in a /spl plusmn/10% range, and a spatially coherent inhomogeneity representing a vein. The modeled excitation was a pulsed 6-GHz waveform. The FDTD simulations showed that malignant tumors as small as 2 mm in diameter could be robustly detected in the presence of the background clutter generated by the heterogeneity of the surrounding normal tissue. Spatial resolution of the tumor location was found to be in the order of 1 cm.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.756837","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Fourier transform (FT) based methods and the complex demodulation (CD) approach have been widely used in such studies. However, the former lacks temporal resolution and the later needs to extract the temporal behaviors of individual frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new approach to characterize the CTS based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). It allows us to investigate the time-frequency dynamics of different rhythmic-band activities in the CTS simultaneously. Two application results are presented to illustrate the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the chronobiological signals based on the continuous wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The timing, repeatability and shape of crackles are important parameters for diagnosis. Therefore, automatic detection of crackles and their classification have important clinical value. Since crackles have a general characteristic shape, it is obvious that wavelet analysis can be exploited to detect crackles and to classify them. In this paper, we present a new method for crackle detection which is based on a 'matched' wavelet transform. We first model crackles as a mathematical function. Then we design a matched wavelet based on this model. Applying a soft threshold to the results of the continuous wavelet transform to suppress noise further, the optimal scale can be obtained. Crackles can be detected based on the envelope of the signal at an optimal scale, and can be classified based on the energy distribution with scale. Theory, methods and experimental results are given in detail in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crackle detection and classification based on matched wavelet analysis","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Although mechanical and reflex properties have been studied extensively under length-controlled conditions, their interaction with inertial loads, which are the most commonly experienced natural loads, have been infrequently studied. These interactions could be the key to understanding joint stability. The goal of this study was to characterize the damping properties of the neuromuscular system when coupled to inertial loads and analyze system responses with respect to postural stability. We performed two series of parallel experiments using the soleus in a decerebrate cat preparation and the interphalageal joint of the thumb in humans. Damping properties were assessed by applying a force impulse to a simulated inertia and measuring the energy transfer between the muscle and load. In human and cat preparations, damping depended upon oscillation amplitude and movement history. In contrast to linear systems with fixed parameters, these nonlinearities provide the advantage of initially promoting preservation of position and subsequently damping oscillations. It is postulated that the beneficial nonlinear mechanical behaviors arise from the automatic movement-induced modulation of reflex sensitivity interacting with intrinsic muscular properties.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Humans","Neuromuscular","Mechanical factors","Force measurement","Stability analysis","Thumb","Energy measurement","Energy exchange","Muscles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuromuscular stimulation","damping","mechanical stability","oscillations","nonlinear systems","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear damping properties","postural stability","neuromuscular system","damped oscillations","external disturbances","inertial loads","joint stability","system responses","soleus muscle","decerebrate cat preparation","interphalageal joint","human thumb","force impulse","energy transfer","oscillation amplitude","movement history","position preservation","nonlinear mechanical behavior","automatic movement-induced modulation","reflex sensitivity","intrinsic muscular properties"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.757036","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Estimates on this reduction are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/4234/16416/00757197.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/4234.757197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.757197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multi-beam CDMA-based LEO satellite systems in a Rice-lognormal channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low earth orbit satellites","Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Bismuth","Convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Performance analysis","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","personal communication networks","mobile satellite communication","Rician channels","log normal distribution","satellite antennas","multibeam antennas","antenna radiation patterns","Viterbi decoding","convolutional codes","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","error statistics","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-beam CDMA-based LEO satellite systems","Rice-lognormal channel","performance","code-division multiple-access","convolutional coding","low Earth orbit","soft decision Viterbi decoding","multiple access interference reduction","perfect power control","system capacity","elevation restraint","satellite footprint","personal communication services","PCN","satellite antenna radiation","BPSK","DS-CDMA","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1999","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multi-beam CDMA-based LEO satellite systems in a Rice-lognormal channel","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","accessionNumber":"6261328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multi-beam CDMA-based LEO satellite systems in a Rice-lognormal channel","sourcePdf":"00757197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035387S","chronDate":"April  1999","isNumber":"16416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","articleId":"757197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":757198,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Su Park","affiliation":["R&D Center, Mediacomm, Inc., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Su Park","id":"37351531400"},{"name":"Dong Ho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Ho Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"757198","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Multiaccess communication","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Wireless application protocol","Delay","Communication system traffic control","Quality of service","Feedback","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","packet reservation multiple access","packet radio networks","multimedia communication","telecommunication services","spread spectrum communication","delays","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced channel access scheme","integrated multimedia services","bit rates","CDMA networks","code sharing","wireless medium access control protocol","MAC protocol","connection-oriented services","connectionless services","mobile terminals","multiple slots","multiple spreading codes","contention","reservation","optimum frequency resources","response time","waiting time","mean delay time minimisation","connectionless bulky traffic","PCRMA","packet code reservation multiple access","mobile multimedia services"]}],"abstract":"For efficient code sharing among users, a wireless medium access control (MAC) protocol for CDMA networks is proposed, which supports connection-oriented, as well as connectionless, services and provides the various bit rates needed for the integrated multimedia services.

It claimed to have several advantages, but its convergence properties were not described. In this paper, we first consider the standard version of this network. We determine all its equilibrium points and analyze their stability for a small adaptation gain. We prove that the stationary independent sources that this network can separate are the globally sub-Gaussian signals. As the Herault-Jutten (1991) network applies to the same sources, we thus show that the advantages of the new network are not counterbalanced by a reduced field of application, which confirms its attractiveness in the considered conditions. Moreover, we then introduce and analyze a modified version of this network, which can separate the globally super-Gaussian source signals. These theoretical results are experimentally confirmed by computer simulations. As a result of our overall investigation, a method for processing each one of the two classes of signals (i.e. sub- and super-Gaussian) is available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6238005","volume":"47","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the convergence properties of self-normalized source separation neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the convergence properties of self-normalized source separation neural networks","sourcePdf":"00757215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033722S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","articleId":"757215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":757217,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

The mean transient and convergence behavior of a simplified two-layer neural network has been studied previously in order to better understand this neural network application. The network was trained with zero mean Gaussian data. This paper extends these results to include the effects of the weight fluctuations on the mean square error (MSE). A new methodology is presented that can be extended to other nonlinear learning problems. The new mathematical model is able to predict the MSE learning behavior as a function of the algorithm step size /spl mu/. The performance analysis is based on the derivation of linear recursions for the variance and covariance of the weights that depend nonlinearly on the mean weights. These linear recursions can be used to predict the local mean-square stability of the weights. As in linear gradient search problems (LMS, etc.), it is shown that there exists an optimum p (minimizing the MSE), which is the result of the tradeoff between fast learning and small weight fluctuations. Monte Carlo simulations display excellent agreement between the actual behavior and the predictions of the theoretical model over a wide range of /spl mu/ values.","doi":"10.1109/78.757217","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16415/00757217.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1303","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.757217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fluctuation analysis of a two-layer backpropagation algorithm used for modeling nonlinear memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fluctuation analysis of a two-layer backpropagation algorithm used for modeling nonlinear memoryless channels","volume":"47","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6238007","publicationDate":"May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fluctuation analysis of a two-layer backpropagation algorithm used for modeling nonlinear memoryless channels","sourcePdf":"00757217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043982S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","articleId":"757217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":757219,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Hongbin Li","id":"37281093000"},{"name":"P.

A discrete fractional Fourier transform has been developed by Santhanam and McClellan (see ibid., vol.42, p.994-98, 1996) but its results do not match those of the corresponding continuous fractional Fourier transforms. We propose a new discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFRFT). The new DFRFT has DFT Hermite eigenvectors and retains the eigenvalue-eigenfunction relation as a continous FRFT. To obtain DFT Hermite eigenvectors, two orthogonal projection methods are introduced. Thus, the new DFRFT will provide similar transform and rotational properties as those of continuous fractional Fourier transforms. Moreover, the relationship between FRFT and the proposed DFRFT has been established in the same way as the conventional DFT-to-continuous-Fourier transform.","doi":"10.1109/78.757221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/16415/00757221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.757221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16415","startPage":"1335","endPage":"1348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete fractional Fourier transform based on orthogonal projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete fractional Fourier transform based on orthogonal projections","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6238011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete fractional Fourier transform based on orthogonal projections","sourcePdf":"00757221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052421S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"205","articleId":"757221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":757223,"authors":[{"name":"Hyesook Lim","affiliation":["Advanced Video Technology Department, Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hyesook Lim","id":"37345431800"},{"name":"E.E.

The essence of our technique is to combine two distinct types of semisystolic arrays into one truly systolic array. The resulting systolic array accepts streams of input data (i.e., it does not require any preloading), and it produces output data streams at the boundary of the array. No networks for intermediate spectrum transposition between constituent transforms are required. The systolic array has regular processing elements that contain a complex multiplier accumulator and a few registers and multiplexers.

Continued work on these devices should enable them to achieve continuous-wave operation at multimegawatt power levels at frequencies in the 100-GHz to 200-GHz range, thereby meeting the requirements of planned magnetic fusion experiments. The development of gyro-oscillators for fusion experiments has led to the utilization of the devices in several industrial applications, such as ceramic sintering and metal joining. Activities in this area involve adapting the oscillators to the industrial environment where reliability, efficiency, and ease of operation are paramount.

Of course, many of these gains have been achieved by the development of different devices. The typical development pattern for a given device exhibits and initial period of rapid improvement followed by a plateau determined by technological or physical limitations on the concept. Slow wave devices such as magnetrons and/or klystrons operate efficiently at frequencies up through X-band or somewhat higher. Helix or coupled cavity traveling-wave tubes are used for various applications at frequencies ranging up through W-band. At still higher frequencies, fast wave devices such as gyrotrons and free-electron lasers are required for high-power operation. The free-electron laser concept is unique in that the mechanism is applicable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum; free-electron lasers have been built at wavelengths from microwaves through the ultraviolet, and plans are under development for X-ray systems. Our purpose in this paper is to describe the principal directions of free-electron laser research at the present time. To this end, we first give a brief tutorial of the physics underlying the concept and then describe the principal development paths under way.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-electron lasers: vacuum electronic generators of coherent radiation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.757255","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel4/5/16414/00757255.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.757255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757255","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Free-electron lasers: vacuum electronic generators of coherent radiation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"87","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6243969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-electron lasers: vacuum electronic generators of coherent radiation","sourcePdf":"00757255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149843S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"33","articleId":"757255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":757268,"authors":[{"name":"E.Yu.

Theoretical evaluation of the acoustic signal mutual coherence function (MCF) of space for a given sound-speed profile and particular scattering mechanism is provided. The predictions of the MCF are employed as input data to investigate the coherence-induced effects on the horizontal and vertical array gains associated with linear and quadratic beamformers with emphasis on the optimal ones. A method of the radiation transport equation is developed to calculate the MCF of the multimode signal under the assumption that internal waves or surface wind waves are the main source of long-range acoustic fluctuations in a deep-water channel. Basic formulations of the array weight vectors and small signal deflection are then exploited to examine optimal linear and quadratic processors in comparison with plane-wave beamformers. For vertical arrays, particular attention is paid also to evaluation of the ambient modal noise factor. The numerical simulations are carried out for range-independent environments from the Northwest Pacific for a sound frequency of 250 Hz and distances up to 1000 km. It was shown distinctly that both signal coherence degradation and modal noise affect large-array gain, and these effects are substantially dependent on the processing technique used. Rough surface sound scattering was determined to cause the most significant effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6242773","displayDocTitle":"Deep-water acoustic coherence at long ranges: theoretical prediction and effects on large-array signal processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-water acoustic coherence at long ranges: theoretical prediction and effects on large-array signal processing","sourcePdf":"00757268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077359S","chronDate":"Apr 1999","isNumber":"16413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"72","articleId":"757268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":757275,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Considering the potential benefits involved, this paper presents an overview of the swimming mechanisms employed by fish. The motivation is to provide a relevant and useful introduction to the existing literature for engineers with an interest in the emerging area of aquatic biomechanisms. The fish swimming types are presented, following the well-established classification scheme and nomenclature originally proposed by Breder. Fish swim either by body and/or caudal fin (BCF) movements or using median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion. The latter is generally employed at slow speeds, offering greater maneuverability and better propulsive efficiency, while BCF movements can achieve greater thrust and accelerations. For both BCF and MPF locomotion, specific swimming modes are identified, based on the propulsor and the type of movements (oscillatory or undulatory) employed for thrust generation. Along with general descriptions and kinematic data, the analytical approaches developed to study each swimming mode are also introduced.

For achievement of low-cost manufacturing, modeling, optimization, and control of via formation are therefore crucial. In this paper, a model-based supervisory control algorithm is developed and applied to reduce undesirable behaviour resulting from various process disturbances. Sequential neural network process models are used for system identification, and genetic algorithms are applied to update process recipes. Computer simulation results show excellent control of output response shift and drift and reduction of process variation. The supervisory control algorithm is then verified experimentally, and control results again show significant improvement in film thickness and via yield. It is expected that this system can also improve other process responses when suitably tuned and improved.","doi":"10.1109/ISAPM.1999.757296","startPage":"106","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Symposium on Advanced Packaging Materials.

The fault coverage model is an exponentially decaying function with three parameters, which include the fault coverage upper bound, UB, the fault coverage lower bound, LB, and the rate of fault coverage change, /spl alpha/. The fault coverages using three different testing scenarios, which are no DFT, scan, iddq testing, are predicted using circuit design information, such as gate count, I/O count, and FF count. These parameters are often readily available at the early stage of VLSI design. Finally, the composite fault coverage is estimated by combining different fault coverages.

Re-decomposition task is formulated as substituting node two fanins for exactly one fanin.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays","Propagation delay","Optimization methods","Minimization methods","Signal generators","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic synthesis","heterogeneous LUT FPGA","XILINX4000 architecture","two step decomposition","two-level logic representation","graph","fanin nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757424","doi":"10.1109/GLSV.1999.757424","startPage":"242","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel4/6127/16377/00757424.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLSV.1999.757424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757424/","displayDocTitle":"Methodology of logic synthesis for implementation using heterogeneous LUT FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Mar 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6364360","conferenceDate":"4-6 March 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodology of logic synthesis for implementation using heterogeneous LUT FPGAs","confLoc":"Ypsilanti, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00757424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026417S","chronDate":"4-6 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6127","articleId":"757424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":757428,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Nortel Technologies, Inc., Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Wei Li","id":"37366421600"},{"name":"D.K.

Such a FPGA is called a hierarchical FPGA (HFPGA). A novel model is proposed to analyze various HFPGA configurations. A software tool has been developed to predict the routability of circuits on specific HFPGA architectures. Primary contribution of this work is that routability prediction can be done immediately after the technology-mapping step, rather than after placement. The effect of connection block and switch block flexibility on routability is also studied. The results show that compared to a symmetrical FPGA architecture we can achieve the same degree of routability on a HFPGA, with much fewer routing switches.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Ninth Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel4/6127/16377/00757428.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routability prediction for hierarchical FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/GLSV.1999.757428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLSV.1999.757428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Mar 1999","displayDocTitle":"Routability prediction for hierarchical FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6370601","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 March 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routability prediction for hierarchical FPGAs","confLoc":"Ypsilanti, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00757428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063531S","chronDate":"4-6 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6127","citationCount":"7","articleId":"757428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":757436,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper we compare the performance of the BMA with other LS based algorithms including: minimum norm solution based algorithm (MNS), forward-backward linear prediction based algorithm (FBLP) and singular-value decomposition based minimum norm algorithm (SVD-MNA). Results of computer experiments show that the introduction of minimum norm solution, foward-backward prediction and the SVD decomposition may significantly improve the performance of the decoder in the case of the relatively low SNR. In selecting between the proposed algorithms a performance/complexity trade-off has to be considered.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.757512","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Roughly speaking, the algorithm comprises Fourier-domain system inversion followed by wavelet-domain noise suppression. Our approach subsumes a number of other wavelet-based deconvolution methods. In contrast to other wavelet-based approaches, however, we employ a regularized inverse filter, which allows the algorithm to operate even when the inverse system is ill-conditioned or non-invertible. Using a mean-square-error metric, we strike an optimal balance between Fourier-domain and wavelet-domain regularization. The result is a fast deconvolution algorithm ideally suited to signals and images with edges and other singularities.

Motivated by the intimate connection between compression and denoising, this paper explores the significant role of the underlying statistical wavelet image model. The model used here, a simplified version of the one proposed by LoPresto, Ramchandran and Orchard (see Proc. IEEE Data Compression Conf., 1997), is that of a mixture process of independent component fields having a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with unknown variances /spl sigma//sub s//sup 2/ that are slowly spatially-varying with the wavelet coefficient location s. We propose to use this model for image denoising by initially estimating the underlying variance field using a maximum likelihood (ML) rule and then applying the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation procedure. In the process of variance estimation, we assume that the variance field is \"locally\" smooth to allow its reliable estimation, and use an adaptive window-based estimation procedure to capture the effect of edges. Despite the simplicity of our method, our denoising results compare favorably with the best reported results in the denoising literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially adaptive statistical modeling of wavelet image coefficients and its application to denoising","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Typically, parameter estimation techniques for transformation models require the user to manually select feature points between the images undergoing registration. In this research, block matching is used to automatically select correlated feature point pairs between two images, and these features are used to calculate an iterative least squares solution for the projective transformation parameters. Since block matching is capable of estimating accurate translation motion vectors only in discontinuous edge regions, inaccurate feature point pairs are statistically eliminated prior to computing the least squares parameter estimate. Convergence of the projective transformation model estimation algorithm is generally achieved in several iterations. After subpixel-resolution image registration, a high-resolution video still may be computed by integrating the registered pixels from a short sequence of low-resolution image sequence frames.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.757538","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Since the criterion is expressed with not only the parameters of the model but also shape and location of the regions, the criterion can not be easily minimized by the usual optimization methods, the proposed method minimizes the criterion by a GA.

When an area reaches an occupation level greater than the projected one, people's safety can be in danger. This paper describes a new technique for crowd density estimation based on Minkowski fractal dimension. The fractal dimension has been widely used to characterize data texture in a large number of physical and biological sciences. The results of our experiments show that fractal dimension can also be used to characterize levels of people congestion in images of crowds. The proposed technique is compared with a statistical and a spectral technique, in a test study of nearly 300 images of a specific area of the Liverpool Street Railway Station, London, UK.

In contrast to the two intelligent rooms built in the MIT AI Lab's quarters in an otherwise (comparatively) mundane office building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it also considers experiences making an entire house in Colorado behave intelligently. The experiences of the chief systems architect for the Gates Estate, Bill Gates' well-publicized 66,000 square foot new home in Medina, Washington, are also discussed. Finally, some of the functionalities that we would want intelligent rooms with large numbers of people-such as lecture halls and conference venues-to possess, are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Heart","Fellows","Testing","Books","Computer displays","Missiles","Computer industry","Roads","Computerized monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["home automation","building management systems","office automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent rooms","MIT AI Lab Intelligent Room project","intelligent house","Gates Estate","lecture halls","conference venues"]}],"doi":"10.1109/5254.757622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/5254/16422/00757622.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5254.757622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Room service, AI-style","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=757622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Room service, AI-style","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/757622/","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6229045","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Room service, AI-style","sourcePdf":"00757622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049918S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1999","isNumber":"16422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"32","articleId":"757622","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":757666,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Employment of automated image segmentation approaches is increasingly common. Unfortunately, the utility of existing medical image analysis systems is limited by their narrow, highly specific task orientation. We have developed a method for an automated design of optimal border detection criteria based on learning from image segmentation examples. Two learning approaches were proposed: A feature-based method using direct least square error minimization and a radial basis neural network. The two approaches were validated in simulated ultrasound images, and in intracardiac and intravascular ultrasound images. The achieved performance was comparable to that of our previously reported single-purpose border detection methods. Our approach facilitates development of general multipurpose medical image segmentation systems that can be trained for different types of image segmentation applications. Such systems would considerably simplify the task of border detection in the rapidly changing world of medical imaging.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1997.757666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1997.757666","startPage":"542","endPage":"545 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The classification property of FL systems makes them a natural candidate for the rejection of errors induced by the deadzone, which has regions in which it behaves differently.

This tying improves the recognition accuracy when systems are trained with limited data, and is performed by classifying the sub-phonetic units using a series of binary tests based on speech production, called \"linguistic questions\". This paper describes a new method for automatically determining the best combinations of subword units to form these questions. The hybrid algorithm proposed clusters state distributions of context-independent phones to obtain questions for triphonetic contexts. Experiments confirm that the questions thus generated can replace manually generated questions and can provide improved recognition accuracy. Automatic generation of questions has the additional important advantage of extensibility to languages for which the phonetic structure is not well understood by the system designer, and can be effectively used in situations where the subword units are not phonetically motivated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic clustering and generation of contextual questions for tied states in hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We solved this problem by introducing the modified second order Markov model, in which the first state is hidden and the second one is observable. In this model, not only the feature parameter observations but also the state transitions are dependent on the previous feature observation. Therefore, even the complicated transient can be modeled precisely. Some simulation experiments showed the high potential of the proposed model.

The proposed method is noise-robust and may perform even better than the standard algorithm if training and testing noise conditions are not matched. The method is based on approximating the variance vectors of the Gaussian kernels by a vector quantization (VQ) codebook of a small size. The quantization of the variance vectors is done using an information theoretic distortion measure. Closed form expressions are given for the computation of the VQ codebook and the superiority of the proposed distortion measure over the Euclidean distance is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown using the connected TI digits database and a noisy version of it. For the connected TI digit database, the proposed method shows that by quantizing the variance to 16 levels we can maintain recognition performance within 1% degradation of the original VR system. In comparison, with Euclidean distortion, a size 256 codebook is needed for a similar error rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758078","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

In particular, telephone speech recognition is extremely difficult due to the limited bandwidth of the transmission channels. In this paper, neural network based adaptation methods are applied to telephone speech recognition and a new unsupervised model adaptation method is proposed. The advantage of the neural network based approach is that the retraining of speech recognizers for telephone speech is avoided. Furthermore, because the multi-layer neural network is able to compute nonlinear functions, it can accommodate for the non-linear mapping between full bandwidth speech and telephone speech. The new unsupervised model adaptation method does not require transcriptions and can be used with the neural networks. Experimental results on TIMIT/NTIMIT corpora show that the performance of the proposed methods is comparable to that of recognizers retained on telephone speech.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758086","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The HMMs are widely-used statistical models to characterize the sequence of speech spectra and have successfully been applied to speech recognition systems. From these facts, it is considered that the HMM is useful for modeling pitch patterns of speech. However, we cannot apply the conventional discrete or continuous HMMs to pitch pattern modeling since the observation sequence of the pitch pattern is composed of one-dimensional continuous values and a discrete symbol which represents \"unvoiced\". MSD-HMM includes discrete HMMs and continuous mixture HMMs as special cases, and further can model the sequence of observation vectors with variable dimension including zero-dimensional observations, i.e., discrete symbols. As a result, MSD-HMMs can model pitch patterns without heuristic assumption. We derive a reestimation algorithm for the extended HMM and show that it can find a critical point of the likelihood function.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758104","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We present a multi-level wavelet decomposition mechanism, using low delay FIR filters, applied to waveform interpolation (WI) coding. The technique overcomes the substantial delay problems encountered by Chong, Burnett, Chicharo and Thomson (see Proc. Int Conf. Acoustics, Speech, Sig. Processing, Seattle, USA, vol. 1., p.513-16, 1998) and identifies a preferred technique for the quantisation of the decomposed surfaces. The phase is shown to be particularly sensitive to the compounding of quantisation errors within the tree-structured transform. The proposed solution involves the use of variable dimension vector quantisation (VDVQ) on separately decomposed magnitude/phase surfaces. This approach provides for coarse or no phase quantisation while maintaining high speech quality. The techniques discussed may also be applied to other transforms and to the quantisation of surfaces in the standard waveform interpolation coder.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758107","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

A set of efficient iterative algorithms, based on segmental K-means and iterative conditional modes, for the implementation of the extended model, is also presented.

In contrast to previous methods, this algorithm minimizes a squared error criterion in the log amplitude domain rather than the amplitude domain, and so is better matched to the properties of the human auditory system. A weighted iterative approach is used to get near optimal solutions to this otherwise nonlinear problem. This new frequency domain log amplitude modeling (LAM) algorithm gives impressive results, especially in the case of high pitched female voices where conventional linear prediction methods are inadequate.

Furthermore, the conditional framework does not lend itself to expressing global sentential phenomena. We have previously introduced a non-conditional maximum entropy language model which directly models the probability of an entire sentence or utterance. The model treats each utterance as a \"bag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. Using the model is computationally straightforward since it does not require normalization. Training the model requires efficient sampling of sentences from an exponential distribution. In this paper, we further develop the model and demonstrate its feasibility and power. We compare the efficiency of several sampling techniques. implement smoothing to accommodate rare features, and suggest an efficient algorithm for improving the convergence rate. We then present a novel procedure for feature selection, which exploits discrepancies between the existing model and the training corpus. We demonstrate our ideas by constructing and analyzing competitive modes in the Switchboard domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758184","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

These constraints are integrated using the maximum entropy principle. Issues in assigning a topic to a test utterance are investigated. Recognition results on the Switchboard corpus are presented showing that with a very small increase in the number of model parameters, reduction in word error rate and language model perplexity are achieved over trigram models. Some analysis follows, demonstrating that the gains are even larger on content-bearing words. The results are compared with those obtained by interpolating topic-independent and topic-specific N-gram models.

Incorporating active vision into a robot control loop involves some inherent difficulties, including calibration, and the need for redefining the goal as the camera configuration changes. We propose a self-organizing neural network that learns a calibration-free spatial representation of 3D point targets in a manner that is invariant to changing camera configurations. This learned representation is used as the basis for developing a novel framework for robot control with active vision. The salient feature of this framework is that it decouples active camera control from robot control. The feasibility of this approach is explored with the help of computer simulations and experiments with an active camera system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1998.758202","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

The objective function used is based on a robust M-estimate. It has the ability to ignore or down weight large signal error when certain thresholds are exceeded. A systematic method for estimating such thresholds is also proposed. An advantage of the proposed method is that its solution is governed by a system of linear equations. Therefore, fast adaptation algorithms for traditional linear adaptive filters can be applied. In particular, a M-estimate recursive least square (M-RLS) adaptive algorithm is studied in detail. Simulation results show that it is more robust against individual and consecutive impulse noise than the MN-LMS and the N-RLS algorithms. It also has fast convergence speed and a low steady state error similar to its RLS counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758261","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We then apply these results to an adaptive LMS filter, where we adapt not only the tap weights, but also the wordlengths as a function of the data in real-time.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The pre-processing step of OHR comprises regular array-based tasks such as normalisation, feature extraction and segmentation. Standard processor architectures cannot however efficiently support the varied arithmetic operations required by pre-processing. These tasks would seem ideally suited for custom hardware acceleration. CORDIC offers all the required elementary functions for pre-processing but is inefficient for linear mode operations (multiplication/division) due to its serial nature. A hybrid multiplier/CORDIC architecture is proposed in which a fast iterative multiplier/MAC shares hardware with a serial CORDIC unit. This multiplier retires 6b/cycle with minor additional hardware requirements. This hybrid offers improved general performance for signal-processing applications and is targeted at the pre-processing task of OHR. Performance results are included.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Hardware","Feature extraction","Iterative algorithms","Arithmetic","Acceleration","Personal digital assistants","Character recognition","Euclidean distance","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","feature extraction","image segmentation","digital arithmetic","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance","online handwriting recognition","general-purpose processor architectures","array-based tasks","normalisation","feature extraction","segmentation","arithmetic operations","pre-processing","custom hardware acceleration","linear mode operations","multiplication/division","hybrid multiplier/CORDIC architecture","fast iterative multiplier/MAC","serial CORDIC unit","signal-processing applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=758297","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758297","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The derived algorithm is essentially the band-matrix-vector multiplication with matrix bandwidth of 3. By exploiting the heterogeneous dependency graphs for the matrix-vector multiplication and using an efficient mapping technique, only log/sub 2/N adders and log/sub 2/N-1 multipliers are needed to compute the DFT of size N, a great saving from a previously proposed systolic architecture which calls for 3log/sub 2/N adders and 3log/sub 2/N multipliers. Furthermore, due to the simplicity and regularity of the architectures, it is possible to design a low power processor by turning off the hardware components of no operation at proper time steps. VLSI implementation of the DFT/IDFT processor with distributed finite state machine (FSM) for timing control is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758302","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The architecture employs a canonical-signed-digit serial multiplication to reduce hardware resources and requires only one multiplier to perform the final scaling. A proposed algorithm searching for an optimal assignment of cosine factors leads to a resource saving of about 12% for the multiplication blocks if carry-ripple-adders are assumed to be used.

The interest in reversible variable length codes (RVLCs) has come about due to the growing need for wireless exchange of compressed image and video signals over noisy channels and the ability for RVLCs to provide greater error robustness than their non-reversible counterparts (VLCs). With the current ITU H.263+ and ISO MPEG-4 standards already using RVLCs, low power implementations of the RVLC are essential in providing error robustness in real-time systems, while minimizing power consumption. This paper presents the first published VLSI architectures of a low power reversible variable length encoder and decoder. Results show power consumption of less than 1 mW for both encoder and decoder, with an additional 65% increase in area for the decoder over that of a conventional VLD design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of a reversible variable length encoder/decoder","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758312","startPage":"1969","endPage":"1972 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16342","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

However, parametric techniques are significantly more computationally demanding than the Fourier based methods and require a wider range of arithmetic functionality; for example, operations such as division and square-root are often necessary. These arithmetic processes exhibit communication bottleneck and their hardware implementation can be inefficient when used in conjunction with multipliers. A programmable, bit-serial, multiplier/divider, which overcomes the bottleneck problems by using a data interleaving scheme, is introduced. This interleaved processor is used to show how the parametric modified covariance spectral estimator can be efficiently routed on a field programmable gate array for real-time applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758313","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The frame memory compression method reduces the memory cost by half and achieves HDTV decoding with a single 64 Mb DRDRAM chip without loss of memory access efficiency.

The genetic algorithm uses a fitness vector that guides the genetic operators crossover and mutation resulting in a fast convergence towards near perfect solutions. The proposed method is also applicable to the problem of register allocation by using a different fitness function. Another advantage of the genetic algorithm approach is that usually a great number of equally performing schedules is obtained allowing for further optimization subject to arbitrary constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758319","pdfPath":"/iel4/6110/16342/00758319.pdf","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2000 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

For a reliable reconstruction of the signal from its samples we require knowledge of the bandwidth of the signal, which however is often not known a priori. Therefore robust and efficient methods are needed that allow one to estimate the bandwidth of a signal from nonuniform spaced, noisy samples. We present two procedures for bandwidth estimation. The first method is based on the discrete Bernstein inequality and Newton's divided differences and is computationally very efficient. The second method requires somewhat more computational effort, since it simultaneously estimates the bandwidth and provides a reconstruction of the signal. It is based on a multi-scale conjugate gradient algorithm for the solution of a nested sequence of Toeplitz systems and is particularly useful in case of noisy data. Examples from various applications demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758332","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The control circuit is embedded within the cores and allows them to be cascaded without any interface glue logic for any desired level of decomposition. Case studies for stand alone and cascaded silicon cores for single and multi-stage wavelet analysis respectively are reported. The design time to produce silicon layout of a wavelet based system has been reduced to typically less than a day. The cores are comparable in area and performance to hand-crafted designs.

The optimum approach in this case is in the form of adaptive 3-D spatial-temporal filter, which is generally very complex and prohibitive for real-time implementation. Independent processing of the image sequences, in spatial and temporal domains can resolve some of these implementation difficulties. Some of the existing spatial filters can easily be modified for real-time implementation. Adaptive temporal filters, however, are more involved. In this paper, an adaptive temporal filter is proposed that lend itself to hardware implementation for real-time temporal processing of image sequences. The proposed algorithm is based on adaptive Kalman filtering which is relatively simple and effective in its performance. Adaptation in this case is with respect to motion in the image sequence as well as variation of noise statistics.

Defects are pixels with abnormal photo-responsibility. As a result they often generate outputs different from their adjacent pixel outputs and seriously degrade the visual quality of the captured images. However, it is not economically feasible to produce sensors with no defects for rendering images. A limited number of defects are usually allowed in an image sensor as long as the defective outputs can be corrected with post signal processing techniques. In this paper we present a robust sequential approach for detecting sensor defects from a sequence of images captured by the sensor. With this approach no extra non-volatile memory is required in the sensor device to store the locations of sensor defects. In addition, the detection and correction of image defective outputs can be performed efficiently in a computer host. Experimental results of this approach are reported in the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust sequential approach for the detection of defective pixels in an image sensor","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The cardiac electrical activity of the fetus (FECG) may be recorded by means of surface abdominal electrodes. The signal is severely contaminated by the maternal cardiac signal (MECG). FECG enhancement is usually performed by FIR adaptive filtering. A new IIR FECG enhancement system is suggested and evaluated. In order to avoid convergence into local extrema, the system employs a genetic algorithm (GA). Two architectures are considered. The first is a combination of an adaptive filter and GA where the GA is recruited whenever the adaptive filter is suspected of reaching a local extremum. The second is an independent GA search.

To this end, the signal-plus-interference-and-noise and the interference-plus-noise space-time covariance matrices are estimated. The computational complexity is reduced significantly by transforming the covariance matrices into the space-frequency domain and by omitting noisy space-frequency bins. The optimum weight vector for symbol decisions is the \"largest\" generalized eigenvector of the resulting matrix pencil. By iteratively updating the optimum weight vector slot by slot, real-time applicability becomes feasible while the fast fading is still tracked. The performance and the computational complexity depend on the number of space-frequency bins, antenna elements, and iterations. Therefore, the performance can easily be scaled with respect to the available computational power.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.758418","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The model extends existing models for networks of neurons connected in feedback with the realistic assumptions that all neurons exhibit an unknown time delay between stimuli and response. Since the dynamical variables of interest are the firing rates of neurons, stochastic models are necessary. The stochastic stability analysis is based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory for time delay systems, and yields sufficient conditions for stochastic stability independent of the delay. These are in the form of the existence of certain positive definite matrices satisfying an algebraic Riccati equation. We discuss also the probability of capture (classification) in the case of networks with several equilibria. Furthermore, it is shown that in the presence of random input perturbations an unstable network may become stable.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.758457","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1294 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

The controller described can explicitly take into account hard constraints on control inputs, and achieve acceptable flight performance in the presence of control effector freezing. To arrive at an effective reconfigurable control design, a new parametrization of the aircraft model in the presence of control effector freezing is suggested. It turned out that such a parametrization is well suited for use within the MPC framework. The overall multiple model predictive control scheme quickly identifies the nature and time instant of the failure, and carries out automatic reconfiguration of the control law achieving acceptable flight performance.

The non-linear capabilities of neural networks can be utilized for a large number of non-linear systems that are not controllable by linear techniques. However, controllers based on neural networks are quite difficult to design due to the lack of good training data. The physical plant developed and designed in this work is a scale model of a trailer truck. A neural network based controller is to be developed to drive the truck backwards from any initial condition to a loading dock. One approach to solve this control problem is to design a valid path, and then track the path. Since the valid path depends on initial conditions, a neural network is trained to generate selective points on the path for any initial condition. The path data used to train the neural network are obtained from software based on a previously published work on similar systems. Based on generated path data, a control is designed and is able to successfully maneuver the truck to the loading dock from any initial condition that was within a particular region. The region represented a group of non-trivial trajectories that the truck is to follow.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.758523","startPage":"1611","endPage":"1616 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

Messages in active networks are programs that are executed at nodes on the path to one or more target hosts. Smart Packets programs are written in a tightly-encoded, safe language specifically designed to support network management and avoid dangerous constructs and accesses. Smart Packets improves the management of large complex networks by (1) moving management decision points closer to the node being managed, (2) targeting specific aspects of the node for information rather than exhaustive collection via polling, and (3) abstracting the management concepts to language constructs, allowing nimble network control.

The dynamics of hydraulic systems are highly nonlinear and the system may be subjected to non-smooth and discontinuous nonlinearities due to directional change of valve opening, friction, and valve overlap. Aside from the nonlinear nature of hydraulic dynamics, hydraulic servo systems also have a large extent of model uncertainties. To address these challenging issues, adaptive robust control (ARC) is applied and an ARC controller based on discontinuous projection method is constructed. The resulting controller is able to take into account the effect of the parameter variations of inertia load and cylinder and the uncertain nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. Non-differentiability of the inherent nonlinearities associated with hydraulic dynamics is carefully examined and addressing strategies are provided. Compared with a previously proposed ARC controller, the ARC controller in the paper has a more robust parameter adaptation process and is more suitable for implementation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1998.758681","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

In some diseases (retinitis pigmentosa or macula degeneration), degeneration of the photoreceptors often leaves the ganglion cell layer and the central vision system largely intact. This paper outlines the authors' approach of interfacing the retina with flexible multielectrode structures for ganglion cell stimulation. Results are given on the material selection for substrate materials and the design for flexible stimulation devices. By means of cytotoxicity testing, in a first step of an evaluation procedure, the biocompatibility of different substrate and coating materials has been investigated. The methods were sensitive to such a degree that even the influence of changes in process technology on the material was detected. Different geometric test structures have been created that led to the design of flexible, light-weighted stimulation devices with integrated cables. The devices were fabricated using micromachining technology. The authors used polyimide as substrate and insulation layers and platinum as electrode and interconnect metallization layers.

To this end, I recreated retinal microcircuits in a chip, Visio1, that models the four predominant ganglion-cell types. It has 104/spl times/96 photoreceptors, 4/spl times/52/spl times/48 ganglion-cells, a die size of 9.25/spl times/9.67 mm/sup 2/ in 1.2 /spl mu/m 5V CMOS, and consumes 11.5 mW at 5 spikes/second/neuron. Visio1 includes novel subthreshold current-mode circuits that use horizontal-cell autofeedback to decouple spatiotemporal bandpass filtering from local gain control and use amacrine-cell loop-gain modulation to adapt highpass and lowpass temporal filtering. Different ganglion cells respond to motion in a stereotyped sequence, making it possible to detect edges of one contrast or the other moving in one direction or the other. The author presents results from a multichip 2-D motion architecture, which implements Watson and Ahumada's model of human visual-motion sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy and Bio-Inspired Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/6134/16401/00758840.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy and Bio-Inspired Systems","doi":"10.1109/MN.1999.758840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MN.1999.758840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=758840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retinomorphic chips that see quadruple images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Band pass filters","Filtering","Semiconductor device modeling","Photoreceptors","Neurons","Current mode circuits","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Gain control","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","neural chips","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","analogue processing circuits","current-mode circuits","band-pass filters","edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retinomorphic chips","quadruple images","spike-coding efficiency","parallel pathways","retinal microcircuits","Visio1","predominant ganglion-cell types","photoreceptors","ganglion-cells","die size","CMOS","subthreshold current-mode circuits","horizontal-cell autofeedback","spatiotemporal bandpass filtering","local gain control","amacrine-cell loop-gain modulation","temporal filtering","edge detection","multichip 2-D motion architecture","1.2 micron","5 V","11.5 mW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/758840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Retinomorphic chips that see quadruple images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6376084","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retinomorphic chips that see quadruple images","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"00758840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045621S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6134","citationCount":"32","articleId":"758840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":758844,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Networks of this type are labelling features by synchronization of spikes and there is strong demand to simulate those effects in a real world environment. Because of the quite complex calculations for one model neuron the simulation of thousands or millions of these neurons is not efficient on existing hardware platforms. In order to simulate closer to the real time requirement, it is necessary to implement a dedicated hardware. Our aim is a hardware system mainly consisting of standard components which is as flexible as possible concerning the model neuron but as specialized as necessary to meet our performance requirements. Thus we decided to implement a parallel system with Digital Signal Processors (DSP) offering a large on-chip-memory. One main task of this work is the optimization of the simulation algorithm for the neurons distributed to the DSP which means the sequential part of simulation. This optimization benefits from the fact that there is only a very low percentage of simultaneously active neurons in vision networks. For communication between the nodes only spikes are distributed via a spike switching network. Processing of the network topology is realized by two different concepts. One idea is to compute the synapses autonomously on the processing node by representing a regular connection scheme with one connection mask for many neurons. Additional connections requiring adaptability and irregular connection schemes are stored in a shared memory. To avoid a bottleneck a synapse caching is used within each processing node. This paper describes the architecture of a DSP accelerator and shows the advantages with simulation results from a typical large vision network.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy and Bio-Inspired Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/6134/16401/00758882.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy and Bio-Inspired Systems","doi":"10.1109/MN.1999.758882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MN.1999.758882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=758882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ParSPIKE-a parallel DSP-accelerator for dynamic simulation of large spiking neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological system modeling","Hardware","Digital signal processing","Systems biology","Computational biology","Machine vision","Labeling","Digital signal processors","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","digital signal processing chips","neural chips","computer vision","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ParSPIKE","parallel DSP-accelerator","dynamic simulation","large spiking neural networks","biology inspired vision systems","synchronization","dedicated hardware","digital signal processors","on-chip-memory","simulation algorithm","spike switching network","network topology","synapses","regular connection scheme","connection mask","adaptability","irregular connection schemes","processing node","large vision network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/758882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"ParSPIKE-a parallel DSP-accelerator for dynamic simulation of large spiking neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6376125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-9 April 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ParSPIKE-a parallel DSP-accelerator for dynamic simulation of large spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"00758882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048851S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"16401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6134","citationCount":"11","articleId":"758882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":758883,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The NN processes most of the tasks, while the host performs signal pre-processing and learning algorithms. In some control applications the host also tracks some discrete states of the plant by implementing a finite state automata and/or verifying plant safety boundaries operations. The tight link with the host allows the NN hardware to be very simple since several operations related with the NNs (learning, weights initialization etc.) can be performed by the host computer.

The conventional CMM architecture consists of a RAM memory holding the CMM storage and an array of counters. Since we are interested in the VLSI implementation of such networks, hardware complexities and speeds of both bit-level and conventional architecture were compared by using VLSI tools. It is shown that a significant speedup is achieved by using the bit-level architecture since the speed of this last configuration is not limited by the memory addressing delay. Moreover, the bit-level architecture is very simple and reduces the bus/routing, making the architecture suitable for VLSI implementation.

A modular approach allows several neurochips to be interconnected to expand both the number of neurons and the number of synapses per neuron, performing a mixed synapse/neuron parallelism. In a system composed of a fixed number of neurochips, the number of neurons and synapses physically implemented can be reconfigured in order to achieve the optimal exploitation of hardware resources. The performance of the proposed architecture for fully implemented networks and virtual nets has been evaluated.

Two measures that characterize the performance of an adaptation algorithm are the speed with which it adapts to the new conditions, and its computational complexity, which is important for online applications. A family of adaptation algorithms for continuous-density hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognizers have appeared that are based on constrained reestimation of the distribution parameters. These algorithms are fast, in the sense that a small amount of data is required for adaptation. They are, however, based on reestimating the model parameters using the batch version of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The multiple iterations required for the EM algorithm to converge make these adaptation schemes computationally expensive and not suitable for online applications, since multiple passes through the adaptation data are required. We show how incremental versions of the EM and the segmental k-means algorithm can be used to improve the convergence of these adaptation methods, reduce the computational requirements, and make them suitable for online applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online adaptation of hidden Markov models using incremental estimation algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.759031","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/16428/00759031.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.759031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Online adaptation of hidden Markov models using incremental estimation algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6244240","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online adaptation of hidden Markov models using incremental estimation algorithms","sourcePdf":"00759031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039166S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"27","articleId":"759031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":759034,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.F.

Unfortunately when using full or block-diagonal covariance matrices there tends to be a dramatic increase in the number of parameters per Gaussian component, limiting the number of components which may be robustly estimated. This paper introduces a new form of covariance matrix which allows a few \"full\" covariance matrices to be shared over many distributions, whilst each distribution maintains its own \"diagonal\" covariance matrix. In contrast to other schemes which have hypothesized a similar form, this technique fits within the standard maximum-likelihood criterion used for training HMMs. The new form of covariance matrix is evaluated on a large-vocabulary speech-recognition task. In initial experiments the performance of the standard system was achieved using approximately half the number of parameters. Moreover, a 10% reduction in word error rate compared to a standard system can be achieved with less than a 1% increase in the number of parameters and little increase in recognition time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/16428/00759034.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.759034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.759034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-tied covariance matrices for hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Hidden Markov models","Decorrelation","Robustness","Speech recognition","Vectors","Discrete cosine transforms","Linear discriminant analysis","Discrete transforms","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition","covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-tied covariance matrices","hidden Markov models","continuous-density HMM","full diagonal covariance matrix","feature vector","block-diagonal covariance matrix","correlations","Gaussian component","distributions","standard maximum-likelihood criterion","training","large-vocabulary speech-recognition task","experiments","performance","word error rate reduction","recognition time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","displayDocTitle":"Semi-tied covariance matrices for hidden Markov models","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6244242","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-tied covariance matrices for hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00759034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028862S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"16428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"295","articleId":"759034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":759044,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

Structural analysis makes it possible to visualize hierarchies of Coleman's (1981) circulatory model Human. Two techniques are successively applied for structural analysis, model reduction and graph analysis by interpretative structural modeling (ISM). First, the analysis for model reduction removes input-output relations with an input-output gain less than a given threshold, and second, the ISM technique applied to the reduced model of Human provides hierarchical directed graphs. The proposed approach: (1) enables visualization of a hierarchy graph of cause and effect relations of the large circulatory model, (2) suggests control and diagnostic information to the model by tracing back a path in the hierarchy, and (3) allows the user to modify the circulatory model. The efficiency and performance of the proposed approach demonstrates technical indications of success in analyzing and justifying experimental evidences with the online help of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6248151","pubMedId":"10230127","volume":"46","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A computer-aided approach to the structural analysis and modification of a large circulatory system model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer-aided approach to the structural analysis and modification of a large circulatory system model","sourcePdf":"00759049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028532S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"14","articleId":"759049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":759052,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A parametric motion approach based on an affine model has been proposed for the quantitative characterization of cellular movements in different experimental areas of cellular biology including spontaneous cell deformation, cell mitosis, individual cell migration and collective migration of cell populations as cell monolayer. The accuracy and robustness of the affine model parameter estimation, which is based on a multiresolution algorithm, has been established from synthesized image sequences. A major interest of the authors' approach is to follow with time the evolution of a few number of parameters characteristic of cellular motion and deformation. From the time-varying eigenvalues of the affine model square matrix, a precise quantification of the cell pseudopodial activity, as well as of cell division has been performed. For migrating cells, the motion quantification confirms that cell body deformation has a leading role in controlling nucleus displacement, the nucleus itself undergoing a larger rotational motion. At the cell population level, image motion analysis of in vitro wound healing experiments quantifies the heterogeneous cell populations dynamics.","doi":"10.1109/10.759059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/16432/00759059.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.759059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of cell deformation and migration using a parametric estimation of image motion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759059/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of cell deformation and migration using a parametric estimation of image motion","volume":"46","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6248161","pubMedId":"10230137","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of cell deformation and migration using a parametric estimation of image motion","sourcePdf":"00759059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052113S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"27","articleId":"759059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":759062,"authors":[{"name":"Yue-Der Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yue-Der Lin","id":"37087261587"},{"name":"Chang-Da Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chang-Da Tsai","id":"37087383493"},{"name":"Hui-Hsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hui-Hsun Huang","id":"37087260721"},{"name":"Dah-Chuan Chiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Dah-Chuan Chiou","id":"37087432224"},{"name":"Chien-Ping Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Ping Wu","id":"37087432993"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"759062","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759062","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Filtering","Interference suppression","Instruments","Differential amplifiers","Passive filters","Impedance","Circuits","Operational amplifiers","Phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-pass filters","preamplifiers","operational amplifiers","biomedical electronics","interference suppression","bioelectric potentials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order high-pass filtering characteristic","low-frequency interference suppression","instrumentation amplifier","differential high-pass filtering","high input impedance","high common-mode rejection ratio","low passive sensitivity","biomedical circuit","commercial operational amplifiers","phase margin","physiological signals measurement","chip fabrication"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electric Impedance","Equipment Design","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"A new preamplifier for suppressing low-frequency interference is presented.

This progress results in the ongoing emergence of computationally powerful new digital systems which, in turn, challenge the progress in technology. In this way a positive-feedback loop has come to exist, resulting in the need for handling and communicating ever more data. Exploitation of the computational power of silicon is the key to satisfying the perpetual need for more bandwidth. However, important as it may be, the computational power of silicon is mainly an intuitive notion. It stems from attempts to characterize the capabilities of a piece of silicon by the benchmark approaches commonly applied to the best-known of all silicon devices: the microprocessor. Clock speed of a microprocessor often is regarded as the decisive performance indicator for computational power and many people believe that increasing speed is the ultimate art of digital design. For this reason the clock speed of a microprocessor has become an important weapon in aggressive marketing and advertising aimed at convincing consumers to buy a particular new piece of equipment. But, is it really true that the computational power of silicon depends, above all, on the speed of the microprocessor? And if the answer here is no, where does the strength of a piece of silicon really come from? What will be the benefits for the average consumer of endless boosts of computational power and bandwidth? Will he/she not be overwhelmed by what clearly appear to be exponential developments obeying Moore's law? An attempt is made to answer some of these questions.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759071","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In this method, the fMRI time series measured at each pixel is modeled as the sum of a response signal which arises due to the experimentally controlled activation-baseline pattern, a nuisance component representing effects of no interest, and Gaussian white noise. For periodic activation-baseline patterns, the response signal is modeled by a truncated Fourier series with a known fundamental frequency but unknown Fourier coefficients. The nuisance subspace is assumed to be unknown. A maximum likelihood estimate is derived for the component of the nuisance subspace which is orthogonal to the response signal subspace. An estimate for the order of the nuisance subspace is obtained from an information theoretic criterion. A statistical test is derived and shown to be the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test invariant to a group of transformations which are natural to the hypothesis testing problem. The maximal invariant statistic used in this test has an F distribution. The theoretical F distribution under the null hypothesis strongly concurred with the experimental frequency distribution obtained by performing null experiments in which the subjects did not perform any activation task. Applications of the theory to motor activation and visual stimulation fMRI studies are presented.","doi":"10.1109/42.759109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16430/00759109.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.759109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Activation detection in functional MRI using subspace modeling and maximum likelihood estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Activation detection in functional MRI using subspace modeling and maximum likelihood estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6253599","pubMedId":"10232667","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Activation detection in functional MRI using subspace modeling and maximum likelihood estimation","sourcePdf":"00759109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067156S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"59","articleId":"759109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":759114,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

The enhancement algorithm works by filtering the image with \"sticks\", short line segments which are varied in orientation to achieve the maximum projected value at each point. In this paper, we present three significant extensions to improve the performance of the basic method. First, we investigate the effect of varying the size and shape of the sticks. We show that these variations affect the performance of the algorithm in very fundamental ways, for example by making it more or less sensitive to thinner or more tightly curving boundaries. Second, we present a means of improving the performance of this technique by estimating the distribution function of the orientation of the line passing through each point. Finally, we show that images can be \"stained\" for easier visual interpretation by applying to each pixel a false color whose hue is related to the orientation of the most prominent line segment at that point. Examples are given to illustrate the performance of the different settings on a single image.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.759114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16430","startPage":"126","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/16430/00759114.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of lines and boundaries in speckle images-application to medical ultrasound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of lines and boundaries in speckle images-application to medical ultrasound","publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6253601","pubMedId":"10232669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of lines and boundaries in speckle images-application to medical ultrasound","sourcePdf":"00759114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048102S","chronDate":"Feb.  1999","isNumber":"16430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"102","articleId":"759114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":759124,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The development process of integrated circuits is represented by a simple model that describes the technology specifications at the beginning and the product specifications at the end of the product development cycle. Considering this model, different intermediate tasks are defined to obtain initial guess process recipe from the target product specifications. The complete technology development is shown to be achieved using TCAD in three different phases such as the generation of initial guess process recipe, the optimization of process technology, and the evaluation of process manufacturability. A simple quantitative analysis to estimate the major advantages of TCAD in reducing the cycle time and cost of technology development is presented. The technical limitations of TCAD and the measures to address these limitations are discussed.

A 100 MB Flash records one hour CD-quality music. Improvements in video compression techniques are expected to realize gigabyte flash, enabling movies on silicon in the near future; a development that is expected to lead to rapidly rising demand for high-density flash. Both the low bit cost due to the small cell size and the high program and read performance are important factors for the high density flash. A NAND flash has potential advantages in those respects. Shallow trench isolation (STI) shrinks bit line pitch to 73% of that in the case of conventional LOCOS isolation, enabling 0.29 um/sup 2/ cell 0.25 /spl mu/m design rules. The 129.76 mm/sup 2/ chip is made possible by using NAND type memory cell and STI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6270111","conferenceDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 130 mm/sup 2/ 256 Mb NAND flash with shallow trench isolation technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 130 mm/sup 2/ 256 Mb NAND flash with shallow trench isolation technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00759157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042819S","chronDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","isNumber":"16427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6143","citationCount":"7","articleId":"759157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":759158,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper reports a capacitive interface chip for high sensitivity silicon accelerometers. It has 95 dB dynamic range, a low offset of 370 /spl mu/V, and 1/f noise cut-off frequency of <0.6 Hz. By using this IC in conjunction with an all-silicon accelerometer with 2O pF/g differential capacitance sensitivity an equivalent acceleration resolution of 3.7 /spl mu/g//spl radic/Hz can be achieved without a need for vacuum or special packaging. This IC can also be used for other high sensitivity capacitive silicon sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759161","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The segmented architecture is most frequently used to combine high conversion rate and high resolution. In this architecture the least significant bits steer binary weighted current sources, while the most significant bits are thermometer decoded and steer a unary current source array. The limitations of these architectures in terms of accuracy, linearity (INL) and speed are technology dependent.

Nested Miller compensation (NMC) is commonly used to stabilize multiple-stage amplifiers. However, the bandwidth of an NMC amplifier is poor. Several topologies such as multi-path nested Miller compensation (MNMC) and nested Gm-C compensation (NGCC) have been proposed to enhance the bandwidth. When compared to an NMC amplifier, MNMC can increase the bandwidth by approximately a factor of two while NGCC can further improve the stability of the amplifier. Nevertheless, the bandwidth enhancement by the two topologies is not sufficient for high-speed applications especially to drive large capacitive loads, such as the error amplifier in a low-voltage low-dropout regulator in portable electronic devices. A topology called damping-factor-control frequency compensation (DFCFC) for three-stage amplifiers significantly increases the bandwidth and improves the transient response of the amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759173","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

This fully-integrated low noise AGC amplifier includes on-chip peak-detect-and-hold gain control circuitry with short attack-time, developed for IF transceiver applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6276271","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A BiCMOS 300 ns attack-time AGC amplifier with peak-detect-and-hold feature for high-speed wireless ATM systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BiCMOS 300 ns attack-time AGC amplifier with peak-detect-and-hold feature for high-speed wireless ATM systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00759176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032467S","chronDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","isNumber":"16427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6143","citationCount":"1","articleId":"759176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":759188,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The video rate, however, is not fast enough for some applications such as visual feedback for robot control, automobiles, gesture recognition for human interfaces, high speed visual inspection, microscope image processing, and so on. For such applications, the video signal, which is a time-multiplexed signal of pixel data using scanning circuits, is a bottleneck of conventional image processing systems. The key to the realization of high speed and flexible image processing beyond the video signal rate is to remove the bottleneck of data transfer and implement general purpose functionality. In other words, a fully parallel architecture with generality of processing should be adopted instead of scanning circuits. This CMOS vision chip has massively parallel processing elements integrated with photodetectors. These chips have a SIMD massively parallel processing architecture with each processing element (PE) connected to a photodetector (PD) without scanning circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759195","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The flexibility comes from use of the wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) scheme in the radio interface.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759201","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Direct-conversion modulation is an effective method to enhance the system dynamic range by eliminating the intermediate frequency (IF) blocks. In this method, baseband signals are directly quadrature-modulated at radio frequencies (RF), and the dynamic range of the RF block depends mainly on RF characteristics of the quadrature modulator (QMOD). This type of modulation, however, has difficulty in obtaining modulating accuracy and low adjacent-channel leakage power ratio (ACPR). Especially lower ACPR is required in the WCDMA system, because the channel is required to have -4 MHz spread and 5 MHz carrier spacing.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759204","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The few off-chip components include an ISM band filter, a balun, an RF matching network, an RC loop filter for the PLL, a crystal resonator, and a resistor for biasing. A transmit/ receive (T/R) switch is avoided by sharing a single RF port between transmitter and receiver. An offset cancellation method attenuates offsets in the baseband without sacrificing bandwidth in the direct conversion receiver. Careful circuit design, timing, and layout considerations provide isolation between the sensitive RF signals and the digital switching noise. The IC is in 0.6/spl mu/m CMOS and provides a complete interface between antenna and voiceband codec.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759205","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

However, monolithic integrated silicon bipolar RF power amplifiers have not yet been reported operating at high power-added efficiency (PAE) around 60%. To date, only GaAs MMICs, GaAs hybrid modules or Si power-MOS modules have been reported. The reasons for this are conduction losses, switching losses and charge-storage effects of the silicon bipolar power transistor. Further, at low supply voltages around 3 V, the on-chip interstage matching circuit is critical for high PAE and high output power. This work presents an integrated 2-stage RF power amplifier for the 0.8-1 GHz band based on spiral on-chip transformers. The application target for this power amplifier IC is a GSM mobile. The chip is fabricated in a standard 25 GHz-f/sub T/, 0.8/spl mu/m, 3-layer-interconnect silicon bipolar production technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759206","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The transceiver chip contains a fully-integrated transmitter, including ATM UTOPIA or synchronous input interface, packet-formatting logic, Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC) encoding, a rate-adaptive QAM modulator and a 10 b D/A converter. The receiver portion of the transceiver chip consists of a high-precision 10 b A/D converter, a programmable rate QAM demodulator, all-digital clock and carrier recovery loops, powerful adaptive filters to provide rejection of narrowband interferers and the equalization of severe channel distortions, FEC decoding, ATM UTOPIA or synchronous output interface and an analog phase-lock loop for internal clock generation from a single crystal reference.

A content addressable memory (CAM) that performs parallel data processing with words as the basic unit is a promising component of a compact highly parallel image processing system because of its suitability for LSI implementation. Conventional CAM LSIs, however, do not have efficient transfer of data between words. This limits image-processing applications. Moreover, they do not have enough capacity. More chips are required for pixel-order parallelism. This 1 Mb CAM LSI has dedicated functions for image processing, including data transfer. It performs two-dimensional pixel-parallel or cellular automation processing. Since it has 16 k words or processing elements (PEs) which process 128/spl times/128 pixels, a board-sized fully pixel-parallel image-processing system can be implemented using several chips.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759238","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

However, the logic supply voltage, Vdd, is being reduced at a faster rate than the required I/O voltage level, OVDD. OVDD scales more slowly due to peripherals, which are built on mature technologies that require higher OVDD. Time-to-market constraints and chip integration issues further impose a single I/O driver as the desired solution. The I/O driver must meet the reliability constraints of the 3.3 V interface with a transistor that has a 3.5 nm Tox (no dual-gate oxide processing step). The 128b L2 interface must run at 400MHz clock rate and the 128b system interface at 150MHz.

Short setup and hold times are essential, but often overlooked. Recently reported flip-flop structures achieved small delay between the latest point of data arrival and output transition. Typical representatives of these structures are sense amplifier-based flip-flop (SAFF), hybrid latch-flip-flop (HLFF) and semi-dynamic flipflop (SDFF). Hybrid flip-flops outperform reported sense amplifier-based designs, because the latter are limited by the output latch implementation. SAFF consists ofthe sense amplifier in the first stage and the RS latch in the second stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The device achieved a low driving voltage (2.1 V) on a horizontal CCD at a frequency of 24.5 MHz. Pixel layout and a self-aligned photodiode structure achieve a progressive-scan pixel with controlled photodiode readout characteristics. An output 3-stage source follower amplifier with new multi-oxide transistors, whose gate insulator thickness is thinner than that of a CCD register, has 17% higher gain than that obtained using a conventional amplifier. As a result, 100 mW and -90 dB smear are obtained. The fabrication process steps are reduced to 70% of those with conventional 3-layer poly-Si electrodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

A 640/spl times/512 image sensor with Nyquist rate pixel level ADC implemented in a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology shows how a pixel level ADC enables flexible efficient implementation of multiple sampling. Since pixel values are available to the ADCs at all times, the number and timing of the samples as well as the number of bits obtained from each sample can be freely selected without the long readout time of APS. Typically, hundreds of nanoseconds of settling time per row are required for APS readout. In contrast, using pixel level ADC, digital data is read out at fast SRAM speeds. This demonstrates another fundamental advantage of pixel level ADC-the ability to programmably widen dynamic range with no loss in SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

This must be achieved at low cost and with minimum impact on system complexity or power consumption. Reported CCDs have this level of performance. However, the inherent analog nature of CCDs leads to a requirement for driving large external loads at high frequency from the image sensor. CMOS active pixel sensors (APS) are ideal for these applications due to the possibility for on-chip signal processing (especially analog-to digital converters [ADC]) integration and inherent low power consumption. This advantage is especially important in large-format high speed imaging applications. Other CMOS image sensors reported to date have either targeted small-format applications or are low frame rate devices. This 1280(H)x 720(V) CMOS APS capable of 60 frames/s operation includes on-chip, 10b, column-parallel, self-calibrating ADCs with 9b performance. Four 10b wide digital output ports support a data rate of 55.3 Mpixels/s. The sensor is in a standard 0.5/spl mu/m 2P2M technology and has power consumption <250 mW.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759265","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Trimming can be used to achieve high linearity but cannot track variations over time caused by component aging or by temperature and power-supply changes. Background calibration overcomes this limitation. However, previous background-calibration methods require complicated post processing, occupy some of the range of the analog signal under conversion, or are tailored for a specific type of converter. This ADC uses a queue-based architecture for creating calibration time slots without disturbing the sampling of the input signal. The digital background calibration uses an adaptive algorithm to improve linearity. The queue-based architecture for generating the calibration time slots and the digital-background-calibration method are independent and can be used separately.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759266","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Three recurrent neural networks are applied for determining a joint velocity vector with its maximum absolute value component being minimal among all possible joint velocity vectors corresponding to the desired end-effector velocity. In each proposed neural network approach, two cooperating recurrent neural networks are used. The first approach employs two Tank-Hopfield networks for linear programming. The second approach employs two two-layer recurrent neural networks for quadratic programming and linear programming, respectively. Both the minimal 2-norm and infinity-norm of joint velocity vector can be obtained from the output of the recurrent neural networks.

Convolutional codes are one approach that have been widely employed in communication and storage systems. Decoders for convolutional codes have trellis structures and are typically decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. The speed of these decoders is limited by the well-known add-compare-select (ACS) bottleneck. In addition, previously reported decoder implementations use a radix-4 ACS block which processes two symbols per clock cycle. An alternative to convolutional codes are block codes which also have trellis structures that can be decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. Since trellises for block codes have well-defined source and destination states, bi-directional decoding which overcomes the ACS bottleneck states can be employed. Furthermore, processing eight or more symbols per clock cycle becomes practical allowing manageable system clock frequencies in high rate decoders.

The PLLs used in receivers are usually required to generate a low-jitter clock, but at the same time, to achieve fast frequency and phase lock. Conventional analog PLLs can generate a low-jitter clock signal with a narrow loop bandwidth, at the expense of lengthened locking time. As an alternative, a digital PLL or a hybrid analog/digital PLL can achieve a 50-cycle lock with a 125 ps jitter from an unknown frequency. But, its inherent complexity causes problems such as a large die, low speed, and high power consumption. A sophisticated loop bandwidth control algorithm is applied such as a gear-shifting or a lock-detection algorithm to the conventional analog PLLs. Here, the PLLs dynamically control the loop bandwidth by changing the charge-pump current in real time according to a well-designed current control sequence stored in its memory. However, in many applications such as high-speed HDDs and DVDs under the influence of phase fluctuation, instant frequency shift, and varying jitter, the stored fixed sequence in its memory is not adequate. This gear-shifting PLL achieves fast locking with low jitter in a time-varying channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759285/","accessionNumber":"6282473","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 250 MHz low jitter adaptive bandwidth PLL","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 250 MHz low jitter adaptive bandwidth PLL","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00759285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022783S","chronDate":"17-17 Feb. 1999","isNumber":"16427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6143","citationCount":"15","articleId":"759285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":759288,"authors":[{"name":"Joonbae Park","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"lastName":"Joonbae Park"},{"name":"Wonchan Kim","lastName":"Wonchan Kim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5126-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"}],"articleNumber":"759288","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"This clock recovery circuit has auto-ranging.

As the size and speed of FPGAs rapidly increase, however, they have begun to be used in /spl mu/P-based systems as reconfigurable accelerators. The idea is to achieve both hardware efficiency and software programmability by dynamically reconfiguring FPGAs. This idea, reconfigurable computing, provides an attractive solution especially for media/network-centric applications. Various types of reconfiguration scenarios in such applications, however, require logic LSIs to significantly enhance reconfigurability in three respects: (1) agility-reconfiguration may need to take place in very short intervals, say within a hundred /spl mu/P instructions; (2) controllability-reconfiguration may be controlled from an external /spl mu/P or by itself; (3) flexibility-reconfiguration target may be arbitrarily positioned and irregularly shaped. The dynamically reconfigurable logic engine (DRLE) prototype described meets this challenge.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759297","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Current optical networks cannot be scaled by simply adding nodes to existing systems due to the accumulation of insertion losses and/or the limited number of wavelengths. Scalability through bridging requires, on the other hand, the capability to switch packets among adjacent subnetworks on a wavelength basis. Such a solution is, however, not possible due to the unavailability of fast-switching wavelength sensitive devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable WDM access network architecture based on a recently proposed optical switching approach, termed photonic slot routing. According to this approach, entire slots, each carrying multiple packets (one on each wavelength) are \"transparently\" routed through the network as single units so that wavelength sensitive data flows can be handled using fast-switching wavelength nonsensitive devices based on proven technologies. The paper shows that the photonic slot routing technique can be successfully used to achieve statistical multiplexing of the optical bandwidth in the access network, thus providing a cost-effective solution to today's increasing bandwidth demand for data transmissions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/16434/00759310.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.759310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.759310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable WDM access network architecture based on photonic slot routing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Optical fiber networks","Optical packet switching","Scalability","Optical network units","Optical sensors","Routing","Bandwidth","Packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre subscriber loops","packet switching","telecommunication network routing","photonic switching systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable WDM access network architecture","photonic slot routing","scalability problem solution","all-optical packet switching networks","wavelength-division multiplexing","insertion losses","wavelength sensitive data flows","fast-switching wavelength nonsensitive devices","statistical multiplexing","optical bandwidth","cost-effective solution","data transmissions","optical-bridging solution","fiber transparent networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Scalable WDM access network architecture based on photonic slot routing","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6231613","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable WDM access network architecture based on photonic slot routing","sourcePdf":"00759310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031337S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"41","articleId":"759310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":759315,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Radio frequency identification device (RFID) networks, smart cards, and even mobile computing devices, in general, need to conserve energy. In RFID systems, nodes are small battery-operated inexpensive devices with radio receiving/transmitting and processing capabilities, integrated into the size of an ID card or smaller. These identification devices are designed for extremely low-cost large-scale applications, such that the replacement of batteries is not feasible. This imposes a critical energy constraint on the communications (access) protocols used in these systems, so that the total time a node needs to be active for transmitting or receiving information should be minimized. Among existing protocols, classical random access protocols are not energy conserving, while deterministic protocols lead to unacceptable delays. This paper deals with designing communications protocols with energy constraint, in which the number of time slots in which tags need to be in the active state is minimized, while the access delay meets the applications constraints. We propose three classes of protocols which combine the fairness of random access protocols with low energy requirements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.759318","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/16434/00759318.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"59","doi":"10.1109/90.759318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-conserving access protocols for identification networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1999","displayDocTitle":"Energy-conserving access protocols for identification networks","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1999","accessionNumber":"6231617","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-conserving access protocols for identification networks","sourcePdf":"00759318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041346S","chronDate":"Feb 1999","isNumber":"16434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"66","articleId":"759318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":759321,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To achieve low phase noise, LC sinusoidal oscillators with high quality factor (Q) are preferred to other topologies, such as inverter-based ring oscillators. The frequency tuning of LC oscillators can be readily achieved with varactor diodes either on-chip or external. The frequency tuning range is often limited by low supply voltage and maximum variable capacitance available to varactors at high frequencies when on-chip inductors are used. Other frequency tuning approaches include varying current in the resonator to alter effective capacitance, or varying relative weighting between two different LC resonators. While the former approach varies loop gain in addition to the phase, the latter requires careful choice of the resonators and their Qs for stable oscillations. This VCO architecture incorporates two coupled fixed-frequency LC oscillators to generate a variable-frequency output by varying the coupling between two oscillators.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

As potential applications extend to higher frequencies, CMOS VCO designs have pushed from ultra-high frequency (UHF) into super-high frequency (SHF). The requirement for fully-integrated VCOs to operate with low voltage, low power and low phase noise usually leads to the use of relatively large transistors in a process where the quality factor (Q) of the resonant tank is low. As the operating frequency further increases, the designs become more difficult due to the large parasitic capacitance and poor high-frequency performance of the transistors. This circuit demonstrates a technique which makes a transistor parasitic capacitance tunable through the use of its back-gate thereby reducing or eliminating the need for a varactor. In other words, the functionalities of transconductance (gm) and variable capacitance (/spl Delta/C) are realized in the MOS transistors at the same time by utilizing (where it is possible) all the four terminals of the transistors.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

This 1 Gb double data rate (DDR) SDRAM featuring ODIC chip with nonODIC package (OCNOP), cycle-time-adaptive wave pipelining (CTAWP), and variable stage analog DLL achieves high performance despite stringent processing variations in 0.14 /spl mu/m design rules.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759327","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

While the large memory bandwidth of Rambus DRAMs and Synchronous DRAMs offers high-speed data transfer and large capacity, they fall short in terms of low latency. Despite the efforts made by many programmers to circumvent the effects of the high latency of DRAM access, memory access instructions continue to accumulate, which limits system performance. The many conditional branch/jump operations of mixed multi-media applications (e.g., MPEG-4), for example, make such attempts at circumvention almost completely impossible. In fact, both lower random access latency and larger bandwidth are actually more pressing requirements for the latest memory systems. In response to this situation, this 6.8ns random ROW access DRAM macro has 64Mb capacity and 9.1ns complete random access cycle. This high-speed random access DRAM macro for ASICs, is to be combined with logics for 3D graphics, MPEG encoding, and image/voice recognition to create compact, low-power, high-performance LSIs for multimedia applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759331","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Many circuit technologies are used to enlarge the bandwidth. For example, sense amplifier data are extracted by a number of data-lines parallel to the bit-lines in some DRAMs. Even if these circuits are used, random accesses substantially degrade the bandwidth because row-address access and cycle time (tRAC) are much larger than column-address access and burst cycle time in conventionally designed DRAMs. Small tRAC is not essential in conventional graphic applications because of periodicity and locality of their memory accesses. However, the large tRAC has prevented DRAMs from being widely used as on-chip secondary caches. To achieve 12ns row-address access, a 5.75Mb cell array of the DRAM core is divided into 16kb subarrays by sense amplifiers (SAs) and sub-word drivers (SWDs).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Random access memory","Switches","Delay","Aluminum","System-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit technology","Switching circuits","Bonding","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","cache storage","microprocessor chips","cellular arrays","driver circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM secondary cache","microprocessor","sense amplifier data","row-address access time","tRAC","column-address access time","burst cycle time","memory accesses","cell array","sub-word drivers","12 ns","8 MB","64 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759334","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1999.759334","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Such amplifiers can be realized by combining a precisely tailored filter with an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). In this letter, we show that Bragg gratings can lead to accurate EDFA gain equalization. Reflection and transmission gratings have been used to demonstrate gain equalization over 32 nm with excursion inferior to /spl plusmn/0.1 and /spl plusmn/0.3 dB, respectively. A maximum 0.04-dB noise-figure penalty results from this process. By extension, Bragg gratings could also equalize the gain of any arbitrary gain profile, over any arbitrary bandwidth.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain equalization of EDFA's with Bragg gratings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.759390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/68/16438/00759390.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.759390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","displayDocTitle":"Gain equalization of EDFA's with Bragg gratings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6237673","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain equalization of EDFA's with Bragg gratings","sourcePdf":"00759390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058331S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"16438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"31","articleId":"759390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":759393,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Shun Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Shun Lai","id":"37087482565"},{"name":"Cheng Kuang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng Kuang Liu","id":"37087481226"},{"name":"Jan-Ji Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jan-Ji Jou","id":"37087482395"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"759393","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=759393","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Transfer functions","Nonlinear distortion","Chirp modulation","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical fiber devices","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Optical distortion","Optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","optical fibre amplifiers","optical modulation","optical transfer function","Volterra series","amplitude modulation","subcarrier multiplexing","nonlinear optics","perturbation theory","optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortions analysis","cross modulations","erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","closed-form expressions","nonlinear Fourier transfer functions","erbium-doped fiber amplifier","EDFA","Volterra series","time-dependent perturbation theory","transfer functions","EDFA nonlinearity","chirping effect","AM subcarrier multiplexed optical communications","eight-channel wavelength-division-multiplexed systems"]}],"abstract":"The closed-form expressions of nonlinear Fourier transfer functions are presented for the analyzes of distortions and cross modulations in erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) systems.

As has been shown in a previous work, the slew-rate of the operational amplifier and the limited output voltage of the integrator are responsible for the starting and the stabilization of the generated waveforms. As an extension of this work, in this communication, a new simple circuit for generating triangular waves in quadrature is proposed. This circuit allows both obtaining the correct quadrature between the triangular waves and controlling their amplitude. This amplitude control is accomplished by the variation of a relation between resistors, thus allowing electronic control. Simulation results show good agreement with theoretical predictions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1998.759503","publicationTitle":"1998 Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (Cat.

To deal with this problem, we have proposed a method for the training of a programmable neural network based on neuron modeling using in-the-loop data. In this paper, an analysis from a statistical perspective is presented which is targeted at solving two problems (a) Is a small neural network model structure sufficient to describe the physical nonlinear activation function? (b) Does the model meet the parsimony conditions? Our experimental results indicate that the method based on using a small neural network to model a physical neuron is practical and advantageous.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1998.759551","startPage":"548","endPage":"551","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (Cat.

In the partially adaptive interference canceller scheme, interference in the main lobe as well as the side lobe of the directional pattern are suppressed effectively.

Calculated results show that the proposed scheme has superior characteristics in cellular environments with slow Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICPWC.1999.759610","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

The well-known Gilbert-Elliott model (GE) represents the memory-fading channel. Its parameters like transition probabilities are related to physical quantities associated with fading statistics (Doppler normalized frequency, fading margin, etc.). Analytical expressions for codeword error probability (P/sub cw/), residual error rate (R/sub er/) and cell loss ratio (C/sub LR/) are derived. The GE channel model is used to compare the performance of a large set of codes including those lengths that are 7,15,31,63 and 127. Contrary to situations where a binary symmetric channel is applied, the performance obtained is improved using short codes and imperfect interleaving. The Doppler normalized frequency and the variation of signal-to-noise ratio affect noticeably performance parameters. Also, theoretical and simulation results are compared to verify and to validate the accuracy of the GE model. In fact, simulation results obtained for a certain class of parameters seem to be in excellent agreement with analytical formulas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Reed Solomon error-correcting codes on fading channels","doi":"10.1109/ICPWC.1999.759628","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWC.1999.759628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16424","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

As the frame duration is fixed at 20 milliseconds, the number of bits per frame varies according to the vocoder rates. At the base station transmitter half-rate convolutional encoding with constraint length of 9 doubles the traffic rate to give rates from 2.4 to 19.2 kbit/s. To ensure that the rate is always 19.2 kbit/s, data repetition is appropriately used at the lower speech rates. Since the transmitted data does not contain any explicit information about the data rate the receiver has to determine the data rate by analysing the received data.

For instance, CDMA is being used in Globalstar, Skybridge and is also proposed for the satellite component of UMTS. The evolution of satellite systems towards multimedia communications, necessitates not only wideband CDMA but also requires a hybrid code and time division multiple access (CTDMA) technique because of the packet nature of the data. In this paper, we give an overview of the challenges in designing a wideband CTDMA modem. As a first challenge, the wideband nature of the CDMA modem dictates that the tracking loops of the modem can no longer be executed in software but must be fully integrated in VLSI. Second, the packet based nature of the communication in a CTDMA modem requires ultra fast acquisition for each packet. The extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in satellite communications largely complicates this fast acquisition task.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

Though such growth sites mitigate the problem of traffic overload and reduce coverage holes, they also contribute adversely to the interference and some times necessitate a complete network-wide retune of PN offsets in the CDMA network. The impact of adding a growth site in an urban capacity-limited CDMA network is studied on the resulting performance. Three strategies to assign PN offsets to this growth site in the network are explored, involving a full, partial or no retune of the remaining sites in the network. The resulting network performance for each strategy is studied in terms of offset protection possible with a state-of-the-art PN offset planning algorithm. A pilot power reduction technique is also used to reduce interference around the growth site without sacrificing QoS (quality of service). It is shown that an appropriate retune strategy coupled with this pilot power reduction technique significantly improves QoS and capacity in problematic areas.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

A directive antenna at the terminal side has been considered efficient both to suppress multipath delay and to compensate large path loss. However when the direct path is blocked by obstructions such as human bodies, the performance will be degraded seriously with a directive antenna. In the 60 GHz band, this shadowing problem has been considered as a severe problem to overcome. Therefore, multi-spot diversity is suggested as anti-shadowing scheme. In multi-spot diversity, multiple base stations (BS) transmit an identical information using an identical carrier frequency and a remote terminal (RT) composes the signals from multiple BS with OFDM modulation. This system realized by OFDM can be considered as a single frequency network (SFN) applied for indoor communications. We analyze theoretically the BER performance as a function of RT position using a simple three-dimensional ray tracing model with up to two reflections in an empty hypothetical room. We show the validity of the proposed system with multiple BS compared to that with a single BS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-spot diversity using OFDM for 60 GHz indoor wireless LAN","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications (Cat.

In this work, HMM conditional independence assumptions are relaxed in a principled way. For each hidden state value, additional dependencies are added between observation elements to increase both accuracy and discriminability. These additional dependencies are chosen according to natural statistical dependencies extant in training data that are not well modeled by an HMM. The result is called a buried Markov model (BMM) because the underlying Markov chain in an HMM is further hidden (buried) by specific cross-observation dependencies. Gaussian mixture HMMs are extended to represent BMM dependencies and new EM update equations are derived. On preliminary experiments with a large-vocabulary isolated-word speech database, BMMs are able to achieve an 11% improvement in WER with only a 9.5% increase in the number of parameters using a single state per mono-phone speech recognition system.","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

We propose a new method for VTN in training: by using acoustic models with single Gaussian densities per state for selecting the normalization scales the need for the models to learn the normalization scales of the training speakers is avoided. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the normalization scales in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For VTN in recognition, we propose an improvement of the well-known multiple-pass strategy: by using an unnormalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The multiple-pass strategy is an efficient method but it is suboptimal because the normalization scale and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative. On the German spontaneous scheduling task Verbmobil, the WSJ task and the German telephone digit string corpus SieTill the proposed methods for VTN reduce the error rates significantly.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759780","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Microphone array sound capture can reduce some mismatch by removing ambient noise and reverberation but offers insufficient improvement in performance. However, using array signal capture in conjunction with a hidden Markov model (HMM) adaptation on the clean-speech models can result in improved recognition accuracy. This paper describes an experiment in which the output of an 8-element microphone array system using MFA processing is used for speech recognition with LT-MLLR adaptation. The recognition is done in two passes. In the first pass, an HMM trained on clean data is used to recognize the speech. Using the results of this pass, the HMM model is adapted to the environment using the LT-MLLR algorithm. This adapted model, a product of MFA and LT-MLLR, results in improved recognition performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Mar 1999","conferenceDate":"15-19 March 1999","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6358380","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition in a reverberant environment using matched filter array (MFA) processing and linguistic-tree maximum likelihood linear regression (LT-MLLR) adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition in a reverberant environment using matched filter array (MFA) processing and linguistic-tree maximum likelihood linear regression (LT-MLLR) adaptation","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00759785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046865S","chronDate":"15-19 Mar 1999","isNumber":"16374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6110","citationCount":"2","articleId":"759785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":759789,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In reported works a fixed probability, q, is assumed. Since speech is non-stationary and may not be present in every frequency bin when voiced, we propose a method for estimating distinct values of q for different bins which are tracked in time. The estimation is based on a decision-theoretic approach for setting a threshold in each bin followed by short-time averaging. The estimated q's are used to control both the gain and the update of the estimated noise spectrum during speech presence in a modified MMSE log-spectral amplitude estimator. Subjective tests resulted in higher scores than for the IS-127 standard enhancement algorithm, when pre-processing noisy speech for a coding application.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759789","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

This technique is derived from a technique in which an N-way speaker identification task is partitioned into N*(N-1)/2 two-way classification tasks. Each two-way classification task is performed using a small neural network which is a two-way, or pair-wise, network. The decisions of these two-way networks are then combined to make the N-way speaker identification decision (Rudasi and Zahorian, 1991 and 1992). Although very accurate, this method has the drawback of requiring a very large number of pair-wise networks. In the new approach, two-way neural network classifiers, each of which is trained only to separate two speakers, are also used to separate other pairs of speakers. This method is able to greatly reduce the number of pair-wise classifiers required for making an N-way classification decision, especially when the number of speakers is very large. For 100 speakers extracted from the TIMIT database, the number of pair-wise classifiers can be reduced by approximately a factor of 5, with only minor degradation in performance when 3 seconds or more of speech is used for identification. Using all 630 speakers from the TIMIT database, this method can be used to obtain over 99.7% accuracy. With the telephone version of the same database, an accuracy of 40.2% can be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759804","startPage":"849","endPage":"852 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Low-cost audio equipment or constraints of portable communication systems cause nonlinear distortions, which limit the echo return loss enhancement achievable by linear adaptation schemes. These distortions are a super-position of different effects, which can be modelled either as memoryless nonlinearities or as nonlinear systems with memory. Proper adaptation schemes for both cases of nonlinearities are discussed. An echo canceller for nonlinear systems with memory based on an adaptive second order Volterra filter is presented. Its performance is demonstrated by measurements with small loudspeakers. The results show an improvement in the echo return loss enhancement of 7 dB over a conventional linear adaptive filter. The additional computational requirement for the presented Volterra filter is comparable to that of existing acoustic echo cancellers.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

It describes the computer-based load sensitivity to voltage sags, by using fuzzy sets and IF-THEN inference rules. The load sensitivity is based on the steady-state and transient voltage versus time profile according to the IEEE Std. 446, also referred to as the CBEMA (Computer Based Equipment Manufacturer Association) curve. Fuzzy logic allows the modeling of the inherent uncertainty of the load reliability. This expresses how the success or failure of computer based loads is correlated with short term voltage variations in the electric supply system. A fuzzy inference system is experimentally implemented for these cases, showing the general procedures of how to use this theory. It appears that fuzzy set theory can play an important role in diagnosing power quality disturbances, and hence it can offer insights towards the satisfaction of the needs of manufacturers, utilities and customers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy logic application to represent load sensitivity to voltage sags","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.1998.759840","startPage":"60","endPage":"64 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.1998.759840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16439","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power.

There are few high-performance decomposition programs. The best ones remain sensitive to noise. They require a long observation time with many samples.

The main features of the recursive DFT are that: (1) it gives directly the harmonic waveform to be compensated; (2) it has a fast response suitable for the tracking of time-varying harmonics; (3) it can be used to detect only specific or all harmonic components with high accuracy; and (4) it requires only a few calculations and can be implemented in real-time. As for a balanced three-phase three-wire system, a new recursive DFT which uses only 1/6 of the data points of the usual DFT is also developed to reduce the response time further. An instability or loss of detectability phenomena in the implementation of the recursive DFT, caused by the coefficient quantization, is pointed out and a remedy is also given. The good filtering and tracking characteristics of the proposed active filter are verified by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.1998.759856","publicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power.

Working on blocks of the input signal, a set of sinusoidal components for each block is iteratively extracted taking into consideration perceptual significance by using extensions to the well known matching pursuits algorithm. These extensions allow including information about the time-varying masking threshold of the input signal during the pursuit. The blocks overlap-add together to reconstruct the entire signal. Although the perceptually weighted matching pursuit on each block can iterate until the error between the original and the reconstructed signal is zero, lower order approximations are possible by stopping the pursuit when the error becomes imperceptible to the human ear or by stopping the pursuit after a number of the perceptually most significant sinusoidal elements are found. The proposed sinusoidal model finds use in many applications including signal modifications and compression.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=16374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759861","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

In particular, the problem under test is the DARPA Broadcast News task. Our goal here was to determine the relationship between training time, word error rate, size of the training set, and size of the neural network. In all cases, the network architecture was quite simple, comprising a single large hidden layer with an input window consisting of feature vectors from 9 frames around the current time, with a single output for each of 54 phonetic categories. Thus far, simultaneous increases to the size of the training set and the neural network improve performance; in other words, more data helps, as does the training of more parameters. We continue to be surprised that such a simple system works as well as it does for complex tasks. Given a limitation in training time, however, there appears to be an optimal ratio of training patterns to parameters of around 25:1 in these circumstances. Additionally, doubling the training data and system size appears to provide diminishing returns of error rate reduction for the largest systems.","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

The concerned abnormality in ECG is associated with ventricular late potentials (LPs) indicative of life threatening heart diseases. The LPs are defined as signals from areas of delayed conduction which outlast the normal QRS period (80-100 msec). The QRS along with the P and T waves constitute the heart beat cycle. This classifier incorporates both preprocessing and adaptive weight adjustments across the input layer during the training phase of the network to enhance extraction of features pertinent to LPs found in 1-D cumulants. The latter is deemed necessary to offset the low S/N ratio in the cumulant domains concomitant to performing short data segmentation in order to capture the LPs transient appearance.

The new approach combines an estimate obtained from a forward predictor with an estimate obtained by inverting a backward predictor to more efficiently capture the correlation and to achieve more accurate predictions. Inversion allows us to make causal use of prediction backward in time. Also a new regularization method is developed to make neural network inversion less ill-posed.

These properties are: Schur-concavity (d(x) is consistent with majorization); concavity (d(x) has sparse minima); parameterizability (d(x) is drawn from a large, parameterizable class); and factorizability of the gradient of d(x) in a certain manner. The last property (which naturally leads one to consider separable regularizing functions) allows d(x) to be efficiently minimized subject to Ax=Y using an affine scaling transformation (AST)-like algorithm \"adapted\" to the choice of d(x).

Instead of employing traditional mathematical models for characterization, we ask human users to select what they regard as significant features on an image, and then incorporate these selected edges directly as training examples for the network. Unlike conventional edge detection schemes where decision thresholds have to be specified, the current NN-based edge characterization scheme implicitly represents these decision parameters in the form of network weights which are updated during the training process. Experiments have confirmed that the resulting network is capable of generalizing this previously acquired knowledge to identify important edges in images not included in the training set. Most importantly, the current approach is very robust against noise contaminations, such that no re-training of the network is required when it is applied to noisy images.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759938","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1112 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

However, most of this early as well as more recent research focuses on the classification of pathological EEG cases, aiming to construct tests for purposes of diagnosis. On the contrary, our work focuses on healthy individuals and aims to establish an one-to-one correspondence between the genetic information of the individual and certain features of his/her EEG, as an intermediate step towards the further goal of developing a test for person identification based on features extracted from the EEG. Potential applications include, among others, information encoding and decoding and access to secure information. At the present stage the proposed method uses spectral information extracted from the EEG non-parametrically via the FFT and employs a neural network (a learning vector quantizer-LVQ) to classify unknown EEGs as belonging to one of a finite number of individuals. Correct classification scores ranging from 80% to 100% in experiments conducted on real data, show evidence that the EEG indeed carries genetic information and that the proposed method can be used to construct person identification tests based on EEG features.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759940","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1120 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

This standard, along with IEC 1000-3-6, has been used as the basis for other harmonic standards being implemented around the world. As the standard has been applied, many applications concerns have been identified: (i) where to select the point of common coupling; (ii) how to select the base current for evaluating harmonics from individual customers; (iii) evaluating the direction of harmonic flow when a customer has power factor correction capacitors and/or harmonic filters; (iv) how to evaluate harmonics that occur only for short durations or infrequently (statistical nature of harmonic levels); and (v) how to evaluate compliance through measurements. A new task force was developed in IEEE to address these concerns. A draft of a new application guide-Guide for Applying Harmonic Limits on Power Systems, has been completed by Task Force P519A. This paper describes some of these important application concerns associated with applying and evaluating harmonic limits. Recommended methods for addressing these concerns are summarized and illustrated with an industrial customer example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/759953/","accessionNumber":"6258581","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the guide for applying harmonic limits on power systems-IEEE P519A","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of the guide for applying harmonic limits on power systems-IEEE P519A","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"00759953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029613S","chronDate":"14-18 Oct 1998","isNumber":"16439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6146","citationCount":"14","articleId":"759953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":759961,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.D.

A generalized dip model is built for all unbalanced dips taking into account the fault types, transformer types and load connections, which shows the transformation for different types of unbalanced dips. The characterization results in a so-called \"remaining complex voltage\" (a generalized magnitude and phase angle shift) for balanced and unbalanced dips and a factor, related to the rotating machine contribution to the source impedance for unbalanced dips. It is shown that the factor is close to unity, so that both balanced and unbalanced dips can be characterized through one phasor.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.1998.759969","pdfPath":"/iel4/6146/16439/00759969.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"560 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power.

In this paper a formalization of the watermarking problem is presented in the context of IC physical design. A class of algorithms is proposed for implanting arbitrary codes in the inherent structure of layout topologies. Similarly, a method is given to reconstruct the original watermark for a given design. The concepts of robustness against forgery and theft tracking are analyzed in light of the proposed algorithms. Examples show the suitability of the approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the ASP-DAC '99 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference 1999 (Cat.
