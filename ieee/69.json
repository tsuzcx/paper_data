The feed \"engine\" can be used for both transmit and receive operations. On receive, the signal across the aperture is conjugatedly matched at the front end by the phase gradient produced by the transmit network. The received signal does not go through the entire manifold in the reverse direction, which ensures that the system noise figure is not degraded by losses in the receive path. The technique can be extended to 2-D scan.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.690769","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

One of the major factors influencing the popularity of these antennas is their potentially useful application in mobile communication systems. This has also fueled a need for more powerful and versatile computational modeling techniques for this class of antennas. We present an efficient method, based on the reciprocity theorem, for calculating the radiation patterns of patch antennas mounted on circularly cylindrical platforms when the current distribution on the patches is available from previous computations. The major advantages of this approach are that it does not require the evaluation of complicated layered media Green's functions for curved geometrics and circumvents the need to calculate time consuming Sommerfeld integrals. The technique also has the highly desirable feature that it is easily generalizable to patch antennas of arbitrary shape.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reciprocity approach for determining radiation patterns of patch antennas on circularly-cylindrical platforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

In this method, ray tracing is used to analyse wide areas and FDTD is used to study areas close to complex discontinuities where exact solutions are not available. The major electromagnetic effects of the discontinuities are local in nature and usually are confined very closely to the edge or corner. Therefore the FDTD method is to be applied to regions with the dimension of only a few wavelengths surrounding these objects instead or the entire modelling area. This would ensure the practicality in terms of computing resource.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A combined ray tracing and FDTD method for modeling indoor radio wave propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

These models have usually been validated by comparison with path loss and delay spread measurements. Because of the complexity of the environments in which the measurements are made it is often not clear from the comparisons why the predictions are inaccurate in some areas and how the models can be improved. The purpose of this paper is to introduce some simple techniques by which the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method can be used to evaluate the accuracy of ray-tracing based propagation models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using FDTD to evaluate ray-tracing models for propagation prediction in urban microcells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

This supports faster service innovation by making it easier to deploy new network services. In this article, we discuss both the potential impact of active network services on applications and how such services can be built and deployed. We explore the impact by suggesting sample uses and arguing how such uses would improve application performance. We explore the design of active networks by presenting a novel architecture, ANTS (active network transport system), that adds extensibility at the network layer and allows for incremental deployment of active nodes within the Internet. In doing so, ANTS tackles the challenges of ensuring that the flexibility offered by active networks does not adversely impact performance or security. Finally, we demonstrate how a new network service may be expressed in ANTS.","doi":"10.1109/65.690955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel4/65/15117/00690955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.690955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15117","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing new Internet services: why and how","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=690955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Introducing new Internet services: why and how","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/690955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1998","accessionNumber":"5989241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing new Internet services: why and how","sourcePdf":"00690955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043918S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1998","isNumber":"15117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"91","articleId":"690955","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":690967,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Huo Liu","affiliation":["Klipsch Scliool of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Qing Huo Liu","id":"37277487800"},{"name":"Nhu Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Scicnccs, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Nhu Nguyen","id":"37363632000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4478-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"690967","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Fourier transforms","Approximation algorithms","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","least squares approximations","matrix algebra","spectral analysis","electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform fast Fourier transform","NUFFT algorithm","unequally spaced data","complexity","least squares","computational electromagnetics","applied mathematics"]}],"abstract":"Based on a class of regular Fourier matrices, a new nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm is developed for unequally spaced data.

In previous parameter retrievals using passive remote sensing, the techniques have been largely limited to using linear regression relationships between measurements and one snow parameter, such as snow-water equivalent. However, the brightness temperatures are not only influenced by snow-water equivalent, but also by snow-grain size, snow temperature, and snow density. Thus, it is important to develop a multi-parametric inversion algorithm using multi-frequency and dual polarization measurements. In this paper, we use a neural network iterative approach for parameter inversion in combination with a snow hydrology model for a priori estimates. The neural network (NN) approach is used to invert the parameters from the measurements for computational efficiency. In the scheme of forward neural network iterative inversion, the initial guesses of snow parameters are given by a physically based snow hydrology model which uses a priori information of weather data as input. The results of applying the algorithm to the Northern Hemisphere are illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1998.691369","pdfPath":"/iel4/5660/15166/00691369.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1260 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '98.

Two multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks were developed for the classification of IFSAR and multispectral data, separately. Classes include tree area, road, building, bare earth, water, etc. A classification fusion scheme that examines both the IFSAR and multispectral classification results at a pixel location and decides the fusion class for various cases is then discussed.

Conventionally, these estimates are obtained through EM modeling of the volume scattering of the vegetation canopy. In this paper, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network based technique for tree height/bald earth height estimation using IFSAR data is presented. Without going through the complex EM modeling process, the neural network based technique uses a bald earth elevation ground truth data set as the target output to perform a training process. The backscatter magnitudes, the correlation coefficients, and the interferometric heights (digital terrain elevation or DTE) are applied to the network as inputs. Training and testing results have shown that the MLP networks are able to approximate the functional relationship between the IFSAR measurements and the tree heights on the ground. The neural network based technique may provide a potential solution for the estimation of bald earth elevation using high frequency IFSAR data.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1998.691605","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1567 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IGARSS '98.

In the the first step, the image is divided into a number of regions using the K-means clustering algorithm. Regions used are dark, medium dark and bright region. In the second step, the regions are labeled using the modified Hopfield (1985) neural network. The stable state of the network represents a possible solution to the labeling problem.

The precise 3D dynamic simulation presented includes: 1) a posture controller which accommodates the physical constraints of the reactive force/torque on the foot with quadratic programming; 2) a real-time COM (center of mass) tracking controller for foot placement, with a discrete inverted pendulum model; and 3) a 3D dynamic simulation scheme with precise contact with the environment.

Optical systems (e.g. infrared communication) are available with different performances, but become inoperable when obstructed. Radio systems are useful for providing flexible connections for non-stationary manufacturing equipment, AGVs and the host computer. However, most of the commercial available radio networks do not meet the requirements for highly reliable communication in manufacturing environments and buildings. A communication system is presented which is closely related to the AGV's localization system used. Determination of the current absolute position provides the common basis for navigation and communication of AGVs. The localization system uses floor tiles that contain inscribed and adequately encoded information for the determination of the vehicle's absolute position. The whole system provides the fusion of localization and communication systems for autonomous guided vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1998.692368","startPage":"187","endPage":"191 vol.1","publicationTitle":"MELECON '98. 9th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.

Other projects in this area are the pre qualification of aperture coupled microstrip patch radiators, highly efficient Hetero Bipolar Transistors (HBT), DSPs for digital processing, and on-board SAR processing data reduction technologies. These are key technologies for the SmartSAR concept which could be realized within TerraSAR-proposed to ESA for the Earth Watch program-or as contribution to the LightSAR (NASA). The main technology developments for SmartSAR together with a short summary of the SmartSAR mission objectives are shown in the present paper. The SmartSAR initiative has been started in Germany to define an commercial SAR mission in the time frame 2003 and beyond. The considered systems, either X-band or a combination of X-band and L-band, aim at a market driven system realization. First assessments show that a very flexible system design is needed to cope with the market needs. In particular a spatial resolution of 3m or less seems to be mandatory. In preparation for these mission requirements, Dornier Satellite Systems (DSS) continues several technology developments. These together with respective developments at candidate industrial partners are the kernel for the future SAR instrument.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1998.692438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15166","startPage":"1701","endPage":"1703 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '98.

A digital front-end replaces the mixer stage found in a conventional receiver. The digital signal chain is immune to gain fluctuations and spurious noise sources which arise in analog systems. Direct-sampling is also a forerunner in the evolution of an integrated digital receiver for Synthetic Thinned Array Radiometry (STAR). The authors are developing a digital L-band direct-sampling radiometer to verify /spl Delta/T sensitivity predicted by statistical models. Less than 0.1 K sensitivity is possible at 1.4 GHz by using a 2-bit quantization scheme. Signal coherence is maintained due to the low phase noise characteristics of the A/D converter, making this technique ideal for aperture synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1998.692447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1998.692447","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1713 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '98.

In order to build the model, extensive field strength measurements were carried out in a wide area of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, a typical European town of a size of 2 million inhabitants. CW signals of several actual transmitters operating in the 450 MHz and 900 MHz frequency bands were measured. Over 1,500,000 records of signal level versus position were collected.

Transient simulations indicated that by changing the load shedding philosophy, the frequency profile during power shortages could be significantly improved. This article discusses the plant's electrical/steam load balance issues and the development of a high speed load shedding scheme. Shortage of power in a network is invariably reflected in collapse of frequency. Traditionally, frequency decay patterns have been calculated using simplified methods. Simplifications have included the assumption of constant deceleration constant voltages, and constant generator power. The results obtained using the simplified methods were generally adequate for simple, slow-acting load shedding systems. In the case at hand, the loads assigned for shedding and those to be \"saved\" by load shedding are part of an integrated process plant sequence, where speed of operation and selectivity of the load shedding is crucial to the continuity of the oil-production process. In the search for ways to optimize the load shedding scheme, transient stability simulations were used to calculate frequency profile, taking into account generators' transient responses and those of the excitation and speed governor systems. This article describes the outcome of the analysis in terms of possible improvements in load shedding performance through the use of rate of change of frequency as the shedding indicator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/692523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5993483","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a load shedding scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a load shedding scheme","sourcePdf":"00692523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028321S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","isNumber":"15120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"26","articleId":"692523","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":692527,"authors":[{"name":"S.

One promising technology which has the potential for use in specialised energy-efficieny lighting applications is solid-state lamp technology. There are many reasons solid-state lamps may be especially useful for new applications. They exhibit long lifetimes, in the order of 100000 hours. Coupled with the ruggedness inherent in solid-state devices, this indicates usefulness for low maintenance applications. Fast response times also make them ideal for some applications. This review surveys the state-of-the-art in solid-state semiconductor lamp technology, with a focus on the potential for such applications, and on energy efficiency and brightness considerations. The different types of solid state light source are described: LED, diode lasers, superluminescent diodes and electroluminescent diodes. Their operating characteristics are discussed and the following applications described: illuminated signs, exit-signs, traffic control lights, airport runway lighting, vision sensors illumination, spotlighting, interactive and fast adaptive lighting and fibre-optic channeled lighting.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Lamps","Energy efficiency","Solid state lighting","Delay","Brightness","Light sources","Light emitting diodes","Diode lasers","Superluminescent diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light emitting diodes","superluminescent diodes","electroluminescent devices","semiconductor lasers","lamps","lighting","airports"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state lamps","energy efficiency","long lifetimes","low maintenance applications","fast response times","state-of-the-art","solid-state semiconductor lamp technology","brightness","LED","diode lasers","superluminescent diodes","electroluminescent diodes","operating characteristics","illuminated signs","exit-signs","traffic control lights","airport runway lighting","vision sensors illumination","spotlighting","fast adaptive lighting","fibre-optic channeled lighting","interactive lighting"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2943.692527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/2943/15120/00692527.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2943.692527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications for advanced solid-state lamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=692527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applications for advanced solid-state lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/692527/","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5993484","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications for advanced solid-state lamps","sourcePdf":"00692527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035561S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","isNumber":"15120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"23","articleId":"692527","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":693407,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For example, motion-JPEG (MJPEG) provides excellent random access and moderate overall compression, while MPEG optimizes for compression at the expense of random access. Converting from one format to another, a process called transcoding, is often desirable over the life of a video segment. The paper shows how to transcode MPEG-1 video to motion-JPEG without fully decompressing the MPEG-1 source. The described technique for compressed domain transcoding differs from previous work because it uses a new approximation approach that is optimized for software implementations. This new approach is 1.5 to 3 times faster than spatial domain transcoders and offers an additional degree of freedom: higher transcoding speeds can be obtained at the price of lower picture quality. This speed/quality trade-off is useful in many real time applications such as offline editing and video gateways.","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1998.693658","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Typically, the PCs in these architectures run operating systems such as UNIX that have traditionally been optimized for interactive computing and lack fast disk-to-network data paths and support for guaranteed CPU and storage access. We report design, implementation and performance measurements of innovative enhancements to 4.4 BSD UNIX carried out to rectify these limitations in the context of our Massively-parallel And Real-time Storage (MARS) project (M. Buddhikot et al., 1994). We have proposed and implemented the following enhancements to a 4.4 BSD compliant public domain NetBSD UNIX operating system: (1) a new kernel buffer management system called Multimedia M-buf (mmbuf) which shortens the data path from a storage device to network interface; (2) fair queueing within the SCSI driver for equitable resource sharing between real time and non real time streams; and (3) integration of these new OS services with a CPU scheduling mechanism called Real Time Upcall (R. Gopal, 1996) and a software disk striping driver called Concatenated Disk (CCD).

Multi-lateral cache designs such as the Assist, Victim, and NTS cache have been shown to perform as well as or better than larger, single structure caches. Unlike current cache simulators, mlcache (an event-driven, timing-sensitive simulator based on the Latency Effects cache timing model) can evaluate a variety of multilateral cache configurations. It was developed to help designers in the middle of the design cycle decide which cache configuration would best meet the performance needs of the target processor. It can easily model various cache configurations by using its library of cache state and data movement routines. We use the SPEC95 benchmarks to illustrate how mlcache can be used to compare the performance of several different data cache configurations.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.1998.693670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOT.1998.693670","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The newly emerging IEEE standard 1390 defines alert signals for network to telemetry interface, which activate the telemetry interface unit. Since this standard is on a relatively specific subject, VLSI detectors for the IEEE 1390 signals are not widespread on the market. Instead of using optimal detection methods, a detector of these signals is suggested here, based on suboptimal detection methods. The analysis has been performed in several steps: (a) mathematical modeling, (b) simulation analysis, and (c) implementation analysis. The performed analysis indicates that suboptimal methods offer satisfactory performance, even with a relatively large quantization noise, which implies lower VLSI complexity and production cost.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.1998.693708","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A previous paper mentions that there seems to be no convenient closed-form expression for all cases of this problem. This is because in one case the expression involves high-order derivatives of products of multiple functions. The authors prove a simple intuitive multi-function generalization of the Leibnitz rule for high-order derivatives of products of two functions and use this to simplify this expression, thus giving a closed form solution for this problem. They similarly simplify the state-occupancy probabilities in general Markov models.","doi":"10.1109/24.693785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel4/24/15181/00693785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.693785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15181","startPage":"519","endPage":"522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form expressions for distribution of sum of exponential random variables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=693785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form expressions for distribution of sum of exponential random variables","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/693785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1997","accessionNumber":"5935190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form expressions for distribution of sum of exponential random variables","sourcePdf":"00693785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018368S","chronDate":"Dec 1997","isNumber":"15181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"89","articleId":"693785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":693859,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

With these different perspectives on the iceberg, the levels of data can be pointed out. For proving the level-of-data concept, we developed a system for the interactive visualization of share prices as a representative example of abstract information.

The analysis is carried out with a two-microphone Griffiths-Jim beamformer and one jammer signal. By examination of the derived optimal filter, a design strategy for the constant target signal filter in the main channel of the beamformer is given. This leads to a substantial reduction in the required filter length of the adaptive filter while maintaining the same jammer suppression. Furthermore, a faster rate of convergence can be achieved, as there are less filter coefficients that have to be adapted. Finally, it is shown that the design strategy also applies if more than two microphones are used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/694434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6033977","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","displayDocTitle":"On the design of the target-signal filter in adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of the target-signal filter in adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00694434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052551S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"1","articleId":"694434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":694445,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, these methods can still be slow to converge for highly-correlated input data. The convergence rate of this normalized adaptive algorithm can be significantly improved by accelerating these methods using the conjugate gradient and Tchebyshev algorithms. Use of these acceleration techniques can be shown to be approximately equivalent to the popular methods of affine projection albeit at a lower overall computational complexity. Simulation examples illustrate that significant performance improvement may be obtained using these methods of acceleration. Theoretically optimal performance bounds for this method of data reusing are illustrated by proof and simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/694475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6034013","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration of normalized adaptive filtering data-reusing methods using the Tchebyshev and conjugate gradient methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration of normalized adaptive filtering data-reusing methods using the Tchebyshev and conjugate gradient methods","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00694475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038498S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"7","articleId":"694475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":694476,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Reduced computational complexity is achieved by selecting a subset of the fixed beams based on a threshold computed from estimates of the bit error rates (BER) at the outputs of each of the beams. The subset of beams is subsequently used to perform adaptive beamspace processing to reduce the co-channel interference.

Traditional parallel filter implementations cause linear increase in the hardware cost with respect to the block size. Recently, an efficient parallel FIR filter implementation technique requiring a less-than linear increase in the hardware cost was proposed. This paper makes two contributions. First the filter spectrum characteristics are exploited to select the best fast filter structures. Second, a novel block filter quantization algorithm is introduced. Using filter benchmarks, it is shown that the use of the appropriate fast FIR filter structures and the proposed quantization scheme can result in reduction in the number of binary adders ranging from 4% to 24% and an average reduction of about 10%. Furthermore, the power consumption of these filters is reduced by 14.8% on average and ranges from 10% to 20%.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.694489","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

TESH (Tori connected mESHes) is a recently developed interconnection network. Key features of the network are the following: it is hierarchical, thus allowing exploitation of computation locality as well as easy expansion up to a million processors; it permits efficient VLSI/ULSI realization, and appears to be well suited for 3-D VLSI/ULSI implementation. Specifically, the paper develops a parallel algorithm implementation on TESH network, in such a way so as to completely hide the communication overhead. Correspondingly, the system performance is evaluated both for the TESH and for the familiar MESH network with B/spl times/B blocks of pixels assigned to each PE, 2J+1 taps per H0 and H1 FIR filters, and S stages of wavelet transform. The time complexity of these two implementations are estimated to be O(B/sup 2//spl times/J) for both MESH and TESH networks, under the assumption that B=2/sup S/(J+I) for some non-negative integer I. The TESH network has an additional requirement that J/spl ges/2/sup m//spl middot/(L-1) where 2/sup m/ denotes the size of the Basis Module, and L is the number of levels in TESH's hierarchy. Thus, the performance of a TESH implemented algorithm is comparable with the MESH based algorithm. However, large TESH networks are easier to implement because of the significantly reduced bisection width compared to large MESH networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

Robustness stability results for the perturbed discrete-time neural network model are established and conditions are obtained for the existence of asymptotically stable equilibria of the perturbed discrete-time neural network model which are near the asymptotically stable equilibria of the original unperturbed neural network.

Binary PLC programs are converted directly into SMV modules that retain the variable names and execution sequences of the original programs. The system being controlled is modeled by a C/E system block diagram which is also transformed into a set of SMV modules, retaining the structure of the block diagram model. SMV allows the engineer to verify the behavior of the control program over all possible operating conditions. Mechanisms are discussed for representing correctly the concurrent execution of the PLC programs and the plant model using SMV primitives.

This is a natural stochastic counterpart of the problem of input-to-state stabilization in the sense of Sontag (1989). Our development starts with a set of new global stochastic Lyapunov theorems and a control Lyapunov function formula for stochastic disturbance attenuation, followed by a design for an exemplary class of stochastic strict-feedback systems. We then address optimality and solve a differential game problem with the control and the noise covariance as opposing players; for strict-feedback systems the resulting Isaacs equation has a closed-form solution. Finally, we address the problem of vanishing nonlinearities where the equilibrium is preserved in the presence of noise, and develop an adaptive stabilization scheme (based on tuning functions) that requires no a priori knowledge of a bound on the covariance.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1998.694673","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 American Control Conference.

Current technologies are adequate for semi-autonomous UAVs that operate in a relatively structured environment. For tactical UAVs in a rapidly changing uncertain environment the present techniques are inadequate. The essence of autonomous control is rapid in-flight replanning under uncertainty. This is cast as a large optimization or decision problem. Monolithic and decomposition techniques are discussed for the solution of large decision problems. Hierarchical decomposition is the most promising approach, but suffers from an inadequate theoretical basis. Finally, research areas are proposed to address the decomposition problem.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1998.694698","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 American Control Conference. ACC (IEEE Cat.

Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1998.694769","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 25th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

The result may be poor performance when running applications whose requirements are not well-matched to the particular hardware organization chosen. We present a new approach called Complexity-Adaptive Processors (CAPs) in which the IPC/clock rate tradeoff can be altered at runtime to dynamically match the changing requirements of the instruction stream. By exploiting repeater methodologies used increasingly in deep sub-micron designs, CAPs achieve this flexibility with potentially no cycle time impact compared to a fixed architecture. Our preliminary results in applying this approach to on-chip caches and instruction queues indicate that CAPs have the potential to significantly outperform conventional approaches on workloads containing both general purpose and scientific applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1998.694788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15122","startPage":"282","endPage":"292","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 25th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

Historically, parallelism has been exploited either at the instruction level with a grain-size of a single instruction or by partitioning applications into coarse threads with grain-sizes of thousands of instructions. Fine-grain threads fill the parallelism gap between these extremes by enabling tasks with run lengths as small as 20 cycles. As this fine-grain parallelism is orthogonal to ILP and coarse threads, it complements both methods and provides an opportunity for greater speedup. This paper describes the efficient communication and synchronization mechanisms implemented in the Multi-ALU Processor (MAP) chip, including a thread creation instruction, register communication, and a hardware barrier. These register-based mechanisms provide 10 times faster communication and 60 times faster synchronization than mechanisms that operate via a shared on-chip cache.

Subsequent references to words within the same cache line result in cache hits. Although this approach benefits from spatial locality, less than half of the data brought into the cache gets used before eviction. The unused portion of the cache line negatively impacts performance by wasting bandwidth and polluting the cache by replacing potentially useful data that would otherwise remain in the cache. This paper describes an alternative approach to exploit spatial locality available in data caches. On a cache miss, our mechanism, called Spatial Footprint Predictor (SFP), predicts which portions of a cache block will get used before getting evicted. The high accuracy of the predictor allows us to exploit spatial locality exhibited in larger blocks of data yielding better miss ratios without significantly impacting the memory access latencies. Our evaluation of this mechanism shows that the miss rate of the cache is improved, on average, by 18% in addition to a significant reduction in the bandwidth requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/694794/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5985673","conferenceDate":"1-1 July 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting spatial locality in data caches using spatial footprints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting spatial locality in data caches using spatial footprints","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00694794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036139S","chronDate":"27 Jun-1 Jul 1998","isNumber":"15122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5642","citationCount":"62","articleId":"694794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":694797,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Compared to simulation, the analytical model is many orders of magnitude faster to solve, yielding highly accurate system-performance estimates in seconds. The model input parameters characterize the ability of an application to exploit instruction-level parallelism as well as the interaction between the application and the memory system architecture. A trace-driven simulation methodology is developed that allows these parameters to be generated over 100 times faster than with a detailed execution-driven simulator. Finally, this paper shows that the analytical model can be used to gain insights into application performance and to evaluate architectural design trade-offs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 25th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (Cat.

Although progress has been made in understanding the phenomenon, there still remain significant gaps, both in its fundamental theory and in numerical techniques for its characterisation. We present a rigorous nonlinear analysis for phase noise in oscillators and reach the following conclusions: the power spectrum of an oscillator does not blow up at the carrier frequency as predicted by many previous analyses. Instead, the shape of the spectrum is a Lorentzian (the shape of the squared magnitude of a one-pole lowpass filter transfer function) about each harmonic. The average spread (variance) of the timing jitter grows exactly linearly with time. A single scalar constant suffices to characterise both the timing jitter and spectral broadening due to phase noise. Previous linear analyses of phase noise make unphysical predictions such as infinite noise power. We develop efficient computational methods in the time and frequency domains for predicting phase noise. Our techniques are practical for large circuits. We obtain good matches between spectra predicted using our technique and measured results, even at frequencies close to the carrier and its harmonics, where most previous techniques break down.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (Cat.

To visualize data generated from these simulations, traditional techniques, such as displaying particle traces, can only reveal flow phenomena in preselected local regions and thus, are unable to track the evolution of global flow features over time. The paper presents an algorithm, called UFLIC (Unsteady Flow LIC), to visualize vector data in unsteady flow fields. Our algorithm extends a texture synthesis technique, called Line Integral Convolution (LIC), by devising a new convolution algorithm that uses a time-accurate value scattering scheme to model the texture advection. In addition, our algorithm maintains the coherence of the flow animation by successively updating the convolution results over time. Furthermore, we propose a parallel UFLIC algorithm that can achieve high load balancing for multiprocessor computers with shared memory architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm by presenting image snapshots from several CFD case studies.","doi":"10.1109/2945.694952","startPage":"98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel4/2945/15187/00694952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.694952","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new line integral convolution algorithm for visualizing time-varying flow fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/694952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","displayDocTitle":"A new line integral convolution algorithm for visualizing time-varying flow fields","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5974096","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April-June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new line integral convolution algorithm for visualizing time-varying flow fields","sourcePdf":"00694952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048773S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 1998","isNumber":"15187","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"60","articleId":"694952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":694967,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Using a 0.35 /spl mu/m process technology, a series of DRAM macros with flexible bank, row, column, and I/O-bit configurations consequently produce 2112 derivatives. The module generator has successfully generated a number of macros, taking five seconds for each macro, including a 32 Mb macro with a 150 MHz cycle time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Application specific integrated circuits","Logic circuits","Decoding","Semiconductor device testing","System testing","Laboratories","Systems engineering and theory","Electronic switching systems","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","cellular arrays","application specific integrated circuits","embedded systems","memory architecture","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM module generator","expandable cell array scheme","DRAMGen","shared sense-amplifier scheme","area penalty","I/O-bit configurations","cycle time","0.35 micron","32 Mbit","150 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=694982","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1998.694982","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (Cat.

The macro cell is provided with developed offset sense amplifiers for screening out any weak cells in write endurance.

A striking feature of the MPDE is that it lends to efficient methods for simulating several categories of circuits that are difficult or impossible to analyse by existing simulation techniques. In this paper, numerical methods based on the MPDE are applied to several subsystems important in portable wireless systems, namely DC-DC power converters, switched-capacitor filters and RF mixers. Simulations indicate speedups of more than two orders of magnitude over traditional methods. It is also shown how the MPDE can be used to abstract compact high-level models from detailed circuit descriptions of wireless system components.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1998.695016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15173","startPage":"451","endPage":"454","pdfPath":"/iel4/5666/15173/00695016.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (Cat.

In most oscillator circuits reported to date that operate in the 0.9 to 2 GHz frequency range, an integrated spiral inductor sets the frequency. It is generally believed that an LC oscillator, even when it uses a low-Q inductor, displays a lower phase noise than a ring oscillator. However, due to the absence of a good varactor compatible with CMOS technology, the integrated LC oscillator suffers from a very limited tuning range. Although this tuning range may encompass the limited frequency agility required in an RF oscillator, for instance to span the modulation bandwidth in a transmitter, it will seldom cover the much larger lot-to-lot process variations manifest as spreads of up to 20% in capacitance. Fortunately, the self-inductance of a metal spiral does not suffer spreads, because it depends on a precise number of turns and on the geometry of metal traces which is little affected by fluctuations in lithography. This work addresses the practical problem of how to design RF CMOS oscillators with a wide enough tuning range to reliably cover process variations, without compromising current drain or phase noise. Prototypes were developed in the 0.6 /spl mu/m MOSIS CMOS process to oscillate at up to 1.8 GHz with a sub-3V supply. The tuning method exploits digital capabilities and MOS analog switches.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1998.695039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1998.695039","startPage":"555","endPage":"558","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (Cat.

The antenna effect is a phenomenon of gate-oxide degradation by charge buildup on conductors in plasma-based manufacturing processes. It directly influences yield and reliability of VLSIs. The amount of the degradation is a direct function of interconnect geometry (e.g., amount of floating conductors connecting to the gate oxide during the processes). The proposed router combines a traditional router and a modification of wires for reducing the antenna effect damage using a rip-up and reroute method. It reduces the damage with only a small penalty of die size and performance. The effectiveness of the router, which is implemented in the layout system HGALOP, is demonstrated by experimental results on 3-4 level metal industrial sea-of-gates (SOG) circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1998.695049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (Cat.

Such codes follow a window one rf wavelength long, along the rf circuit. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to both fields and particles at the edges of the windows transverse to the direction of window motion. This approximation is expected to be a good one for oscillators, and for amplifiers when the gain per wavelength is small. When such codes are used to simulate amplifiers, however, it is found that when the window is followed around the tube many times, the values of the computed output power and phase can vary greatly from pass to pass and no steady state operating condition is reached. In order to test whether these pass-to-pass fluctuations in output power were somehow due to the approximations inherent in the moving window approach, and to study the effects of cathode structures that cannot be modeled by moving window codes, we have performed simulations of crossed-field amplifiers using the MASK particle-in-cell simulation code, in which the entire interaction space is modeled simultaneously. The need for artificially imposed periodic boundary conditions is thereby removed. Similar full-format simulations have been reported by Dombrowski and by MacGregor and Rowe.","doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.1991.695602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.1991.695602","startPage":"143","endPage":"143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/582/4297/00695602.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4297","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00695602.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Format Computer Simulations Of Crossed-Field Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Full Format Computer Simulations Of Crossed-Field Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/695602/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Format Computer Simulations Of Crossed-Field Amplifiers","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00695602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026336S","chronDate":"3-5 June 1991","isNumber":"4297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"582","articleId":"695602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":695603,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The amplifier is physically large with a length of 40 cm, a width of 20 cm, and an anode to sole spacing of 2 to 3 cm. The slow wave circuit consists of a meander line on a dielectric with a slow wave wavelength of 6 cm at 150 MHz. The sole voltage is -1 to -1.3 kV, and the magnetic field is typically 50 to 55 Gauss. The amplifier is an injected beam type with a cathode of tungsten filaments biased independently of the sole. The beam current is as high as 350 mA, and the beam width is 10 cm. This device is typically operated with a highly cycloidal beam. The gain is as high as 7 dB with a 10 W rf input. High gain at higher rf input power is limited by the electron beam power. Two dimensional (input to output and sole to anode) measurements have been made of the electron density and the rf electric field using collection probes and rf pick-up probes. These measurements have been made during amplification. The rf measurements clearly show gain in the local rf field comparable to the measured circuit gain. Electron density measurements of the highly cycloidal beam show that the beam trajectories shift spatially during amplification. This shift is believed to be due to the loss of energy the electrons experience during the amplification process.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Numerical simulation","Electron beams","Density measurement","Cathodes","Plasma measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Electric variables measurement","Anodes","Magnetic fields","Probes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PLASMA.1991.695603","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00695603.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts. 1991 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/582/4297/00695603.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLASMA.1991.695603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In Situ Measurements In A Crossed-field Amplifier and Comparisons with Numerical Simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=695603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"In Situ Measurements In A Crossed-field Amplifier and Comparisons with Numerical Simulations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/695603/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In Situ Measurements In A Crossed-field Amplifier and Comparisons with Numerical Simulations","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00695603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020699S","chronDate":"3-5 June 1991","isNumber":"4297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"582","articleId":"695603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":695896,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

This is an optical manifestation of the \"voter's paradox\" in which a system of competing elements cannot come to a consensus.","doi":"10.1109/NLO.1990.695969","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00695969.png","startPage":"307","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"Digest on Nonlinear Optics: Materials, Phenomena and Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLO.1990.695969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4484","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest on Nonlinear Optics: Materials, Phenomena and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/163/4484/00695969.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive And Cooperative Dynamics In Photorefractive Optical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/695969/","displayDocTitle":"Competitive And Cooperative Dynamics In Photorefractive Optical Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive And Cooperative Dynamics In Photorefractive Optical Systems","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00695969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019123S","chronDate":"16-20 July 1990","isNumber":"4484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"163","citationCount":"1","articleId":"695969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":696293,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.M.

In the case of reading, access time is a function of cell size. The modest signal level of densely packed small cells require a long read time in the order of several hundred nanoseconds to maintain adequate signal to noise ratio. Larger cells with larger outputs can be read in a much shorter time. Therefore, speed-density trade-offs influence the cell size selection for a MRAM design. This paper presents a high speed sensing scheme which uses folded storage cells and two-turn word lines, together with simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed (10-20ns) non-volatile MRAM with folded storage elements","doi":"10.1109/INTMAG.1992.696293","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00696293.png","startPage":"110","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTMAG.1992.696293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4488","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/651/4488/00696293.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=696293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/696293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 1992","displayDocTitle":"High-speed (10-20ns) non-volatile MRAM with folded storage elements","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed (10-20ns) non-volatile MRAM with folded storage elements","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00696293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025204S","chronDate":"13-16 April 1992","isNumber":"4488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"651","articleId":"696293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":696756,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.-K.

Optical signals with subcarrier modulation at several hundred GHz can be achieved by using optical heterodyning techniques [1] or monolithic mode-locked diode lasers [2]. For example, sub-picosecond optical pulse generation at 350 GHz were demonstrated using a monolithic colliding pulse mode-locked quantum well laser [3][4]. These ultrafast optical pulses can be efficiently converted into millimeter-waves by broadband photonic-to-microwave transformers (PMT).

We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1998.698581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15135","startPage":"8","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

In this paper, we present a framework for combining and sharing information among several state estimation processes operating on the same underlying visual object. Well-known techniques for joint probabilistic data association are adapted to yield increased robustness when multiple trackers attuned to disparate visual cues are deployed simultaneously. We also formulate a measure of tracker confidence, based on distinctiveness and occlusion probability, which permits the deactivation of trackers before erroneous state estimates adversely affect the ensemble. We discuss experiments focusing on color-region- and snake-based tracking that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698582","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

By supposing a parametric Gaussian distribution over the subspace and a symmetric Gaussian noise model for the image given a point in the subspace, we can endow this framework with a probabilistic interpretation so that Bayes-optimal decisions can be made. However, we expect that different image clusters (corresponding, say, to different poses and expressions) will be best represented by different subspaces. In this paper, we study the recognition performance of a mixture of local linear subspaces model that can be fit to training data using the expectation maximization algorithm. The mixture model outperforms a nearest-neighbor classifier that operates in a PCA subspace.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698584","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

We compute an estimate of P(object/image) in closed form by counting the frequency of occurrence of these patterns over various sets of training images. We have used this method for detecting human faces from frontal and profile views. The algorithm for frontal views has shown a detection rate of 93.0% with 88 false alarms on a set of 125 images containing 483 faces combining the MIT test set of Sung and Poggio with the CMU test sets of Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade. The algorithm for detection of profile views has also demonstrated promising results.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698586","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

To handle this variability, an object recognition system must employ a representation that is either invariant to, or models this variability. This paper presents an appearance-based method for modeling the variability due to illumination in the images of objects. The method differs from past appearance-based methods, however, in that a small set of training images is used to generate a representation-the illumination cone-which models the complete set of images of an object with Lambertian reflectance map under an arbitrary combination of point light sources at infinity. This method is both an implementation and extension (an extension in that it models cast shadows) of the illumination cone representation proposed in Belhumeur and Kriegman (1996). The method is tested on a database of 660 images of 10 faces, and the results exceed those of popular existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698598","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

The head's projection onto the image plane is modeled as an ellipse whose position and size are continually updated by a local search combining the output of a module concentrating on the intensity gradient around the ellipse's perimeter with that of another module focusing on the color histogram of the ellipse's interior. Since these two modules have roughly orthogonal failure modes, they serve to complement one another. The result is a robust, real-time system that is able to track a person's head with enough accuracy to automatically control the camera's pan, tilt, and zoom in order to keep the person centered in the field of view at a desired size. Extensive experimentation shows the algorithm's robustness with respect to full 360-degree out-of-plane rotation, up to 90-degree tilting, severe but brief occlusion, arbitrary camera movement, and multiple moving people in the background.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698614","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

A particularly convenient way to generate mosaics is by 'stitching' together many ordinary photographs. Existing algorithms focus on capturing static scenes. This paper presents a complete system for creating visually pleasing mosaics in the presence of moving objects. There are three primary contributions. The first component of our system is a registration method that remains unbiased by movement-the Mellin transform is extended to register images related by a projective transform. Second an efficient method for finding a globally consistent registration of all images is developed. By solving a linear system of equations, derived from many pairwise registration matrices, we find an optimal global registration. Lastly, a new method of compositing images is presented. Blurred areas due to moving objects are avoided by segmenting the mosaic into disjoint regions and sampling pixels in each region from a single source image.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698630","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

Beamforming, a method widely applied in acoustic imaging, is used to build a three-dimensional image, associated point by point with another kind of information representing the reliability (i.e. \"confidence\") of such an image. Unfortunately, this kind of images is plagued by several problems due to the nature of the signal and to the related sensing system, thus heavily affecting data quality. Specifically, speckle noise and the broad directivity characteristic of the sensor lead to very degraded images. In the proposed algorithm, range and confidence images are modelled as Markov Random Fields whose associated probability distributions are specified by a single energy functional. A three-fold process has been applied able to reconstruct, segment, and restore the involved acoustic images exploiting both types of data. Our approach showed better performances with respect to other MRF-based methods as well as classical methods disregarding reliability information. Optimal (in the Maximum A-Posteriori probability sense) estimates of the 3D and confidence images are obtained by minimizing the energy functional by using simulated annealing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1998.698638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15135","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

Nevertheless, we show that for point sources and objects with Lambertian reflectance, the ratio of two images from the same object is simpler than the ratio of images from different objects. We also show that the ratio of the two images provides two of the three distinct values in the Hessian matrix of the object's surface.

This method models non-rigid motions as the deformations of connected 2D membrane patches. Local smoothness constraints for each patch are the low-frequency vibration modes obtained from modal analysis. These constraints are incorporated with the template matching algorithm into a local motion estimator. To maintain the global topological structure, different patches are connected together by hinges, which introduce additional constraints in the tracking process. The resulted over-constrained linear system is solved efficiently using a least square estimator. To improve the robustness of the tracker, stochastic filtering technique is employed to take advantage of the temporal continuity of the deformations. Promising results on both natural and synthetic facial motion sequences are demonstrated in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1998.698685","endPage":"740","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

Our method is best characterized by 1) top-down image feature extraction by selective attention mechanism, 2) object discrimination by colored-token propagation, and 3) integration of multi-viewpoint images.

Given a set of training images of an object in context, a learning process decides on the relative importance of the basic Gestalt relationships such as proximity, parallelness, similarity, symmetry, closure, and common region towards segregating the object from the background. This learning is accomplished using a team of stochastic automata in a N-player cooperative game framework. The grouping process which is based on graph partitioning is able to form large groups from relationships defined over a small set of primitives and is fast. We demonstrate the robust performance of the growing system on a variety of real images. Among the interesting conclusions is the significant role of photometric attributes in grouping and the ability to perform figure-ground segmentation from a set of local relations, each defined over a small number of primitives.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1998.698692","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

Assume that multiple prototypical vectors are available per class, each vector being a point in an eigenface space. A linear combination of prototypical vectors belonging to a face class is used to define a measure of distance from the query vector to the class, the measure being defined as the Euclidean distance from the query to the linear combination nearest to the query vector (hence NLC). This contrasts to the nearest neighbor (NN) classification where a query vector is compared with each prototypical vector individually. Using a linear combination of prototypical vectors, instead of each of them individually, extends the representational capacity of the prototypes by generalization through interpolation and extrapolation. Experiments show that it leads to better results than existing classification methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1998.698702","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

In conventional dual-polarized planar array antennas using strip lines and microstrip patch antennas, it is difficult to obtain low sidelobe characteristics because the aperture distribution is deformed from the desired one by electrical coupling between feed lines and element antennas. In the proposed antenna, rectangular coaxial lines have been adopted as feed lines in order to reduce coupling between feed lines. We have developed a dual-polarized element antenna shielded by a cavity, in order to reduce coupling between element antennas and feed lines. Also, we have developed an element antenna arrangement forming the desired aperture distribution by adjusting the number of antenna elements in each row. These developed techniques can achieve sidelobe levels of less than -23 dB which would be lower than those of the conventional dual-polarized planar array antennas.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.698732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

The high coding gain of the standard is due to its time to frequency mapping section, which is also the most compute intensive part of the audio coder. It has been shown in the literature that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) proposed in the standard for the filterbank section could be implemented using the Fast Hartley Transform (FHT) in order to reduce the amount of computations and memory accesses. In this paper, an efficient approach is proposed for implementing the synthesis filterbank of the MPEG audio Layer III. The approach is based on a mixed radix FHT for implementing the Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (IMDCT) section and a radix-2 FHT for the subband decoding section. A high throughput pipeline VLSI architecture is designed for implementing the proposed approach. The architecture has been simulated and verified using the Cadence Verilog-XL simulator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible MPEG audio decoder layer III chip architecture","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

Methods employing parallel ways of operation are presented for maintaining high data throughput caused by the real time constraints of video communication schemes. Object based segmentation significantly increases the hardware costs to exploit the parallelization resources inherent with the employed algorithms. The paper compares the efficiency of recent multimedia hardware architectures when operating on object based schemes under real time constraints and proposes architectural measures to increase efficiency and performance in these cases.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698748","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

One of the proposed structures is a multi-layer printed-circuit version of the Yagi array of wire dipoles in air. This structure consists of a reflector, a driver and a finite number of embedded director strip elements. An alternative structure is a microstrip version of this array and it has a ground-plane in place of the reflector element. These structures give a few more degrees of freedom (i.e., the dielectric constants of the layers) when optimizing their design. They can also be made conformal to various shapes and surfaces (e.g., missiles, aircraft, or other flying objects). To successfully optimize this structure global optimization schemes, such as evolutionary algorithms, are necessary.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

Employing standard 2D compression techniques do not offer efficient solutions in these applications. In this paper, a 3D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) approach is proposed for performing 3D compression. Two architectures are presented. The first architecture, called 3D-I, is a straight-forward implementation of the 3D DWT. It allows even distribution of the processing load onto 3 sets of filters, with each set doing the calculations for one dimension. The filters are easily scalable to a larger size. The control for this design is very simple, since the data are operated on in a row-column-slice fashion. The design is cascadable. Due to pipelining, all filters are utilized 100% of the time, except for the start up and wind-down times. The second proposed architecture, 3D-II, uses block inputs to reduce the amount of on-chip memory. It has a control unit to select which coefficients to pass on to the low and high pass filters. The RAM on the chip is small compared to the input size, since it depends solely on the filter sizes. The filters are parallel, since systolic filters assume that the data is fed in a non-block form such that partial calculations are done.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D discrete wavelet transform architectures","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

To satisfy the VLBR requirement, temporal subsampling is a simple technique which may be combined with other compression schemes to achieve very large compression ratio. A previous proposed block-based motion compensated temporal interpolation (MCTI) (1995, 1996) can interpolate frames with reasonably good visual qualify but also with some blocking artifacts. In this paper, the block based MCTI is compared with a pixel-based approach. While the pixel-based approach has good performance in some test cases, it is highly computationally intensive making it rather unpractical. It is also found to perform poorly in some sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/698774/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"6021146","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between block-based and pixel-based temporal interpolation for video coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between block-based and pixel-based temporal interpolation for video coding","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00698774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062056S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"8","articleId":"698774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":698780,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwu Huang","affiliation":["Department of EE, Shantou University, Shantou, China"],"lastName":"Jiwu Huang","id":"37087148497"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of EE, Shantou University, Shantou, China"],"lastName":"Li Chen","id":"37089140109"},{"name":"Y.Q.

To improve the performance of block coding, a classification can be applied to the blocks prior to coding. This results in an adaptive block coding method, i.e., classified coding. In this paper, an integrated classifier taking the features of the human vision system (HVS) into account in classified coding is proposed. First, we present a classifier based on the local contrast sensitivity of the HVS. Compared with the commonly used local variance-based classifier (LVC), it possesses lower computational complexity while preserving almost the same performance. To improve upon the single-parameter classifiers' poor adaptivity, we, then, propose an integrated classifier which is composed of three independent classification units. It exhibits the complementarity of different classifiers. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed classifier performs better than the LVC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/698780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6021151","displayDocTitle":"An integrated classifier in classified coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated classifier in classified coding","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00698780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039723S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"5","articleId":"698780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":698801,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

In most of the propositions, gradient-based searching algorithms are applied to the parameter tracking. In this paper, we propose an optimal RLS (recursive least square) parameter tracking algorithm, which significantly accelerates the convergence speed and eliminates the gradient noise. There exists two problems for the RLS algorithm. First, the least square solution is not the optimal solution because of the nonlinearity of the PA. Second, the vector modulator (VM) which introduces the control parameters into the linearizer circuit may not be accurate enough to provide a precise power gain and phase shift calculated by the DSP. We solve both problems, respectively, by rearranging the circuit components and by constraining the VM characteristics. We also present simulation results to verify the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/698827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6021193","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The optimal RLS parameter tracking algorithm for a power amplifier feed-forward linearizer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimal RLS parameter tracking algorithm for a power amplifier feed-forward linearizer","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00698827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038962S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","articleId":"698827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":698828,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Traditional problems, such as total dose effects, SEU and latchup are discussed, along with new phenomena. The latter include hard errors from heavy ions (microdose and gate-rupture errors), and complex failure modes related to advanced circuit architecture. The main focus of the paper is on commercial devices, which are displacing hardened device technologies in many space applications. However, the impact of device scaling on hardened devices is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/RADECS.1997.698828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADECS.1997.698828","publicationTitle":"RADECS 97.

For large inductance values, an on-chip passive inductor requires considerable silicon area and it is quality-factor (Q) limited; a situation that can be rendered as impractical. Hence, the purpose of this work is to seek the possibility of using active inductors in RF circuits as substitutes for passive ones. Moreover, an active inductor opens avenues for programmability, e.g. it is possible to attain an amplifier with a programmable center frequency. It is shown in this paper that by proper design optimization the active-inductor's noise contribution can be minimized. HSPICE simulations using 0.5 /spl mu/m HP technology show that our amplifier has a tuning range of half decade for a center frequency at 1 GHz. The simulated gain, noise figure, and power consumption are 20 dB, 3.65 dB, and 14 mW, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Active inductors","Inductance","Silicon","Radio frequency","Design optimization","Circuit noise","Circuit simulation","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","radio receivers","SPICE","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","inductors","circuit optimisation","active networks","equivalent circuits","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable low noise amplifier","active-inductor load","common gate CMOS low noise amplifier","large inductance values","on-chip passive inductor","RF circuits","design optimization","noise contribution","HSPICE simulations","noise figure","power consumption","equivalent RLC model","frequency response","20 dB","3.65 dB","14 mW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698858","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5627/15081/00698858.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable low noise amplifier with active-inductor load","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=698858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Programmable low noise amplifier with active-inductor load","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/698858/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6021202","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable low noise amplifier with active-inductor load","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00698858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040498S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"21","articleId":"698858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":698867,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits and Systems Laboratory Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Yu Wu","id":"37086971486"},{"name":"Hong-Sing Kao","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits and Systems Laboratory Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hong-Sing Kao","id":"37087216860"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4455-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"698867","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":737},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS technology","Inductors","Ring oscillators","Phase noise","Varactors","Voltage control","Tuning","Capacitors","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-controlled oscillators","UHF oscillators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","UHF integrated circuits","transceivers","radio receivers","circuit tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS quadrature VCO","constant-current LC ring oscillator structure","fully integrated","double poly double metal","fully differential two-stage ring oscillator","LC tanks","negative resistance","low phase noise","resonator-type oscillator","on-chip varactor tuned resonator","integrated spiral inductors","direct conversion transceivers","1.8 GHz","0.5 micron","160 MHz to 1.67 GHz","35 mW","3 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=698867","abstract":"A new fully integrated CMOS quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) realized in a standard 0.5 /spl mu/m double poly double metal (DPDM) CMOS technology is proposed, that combines a fully differential two-stage ring oscillator with LC tanks and negative resistance to provide both in-phase and quadrature output signals.

In this paper, we present a method for reducing the decoding delay by means of segmenting a block into several sub-blocks, which are partially overlapped. The proposed sub-block segmentation scheme allows for the parallel decoding of each component code by using several sub-block decoders. The number of steps for the recursive computations in each sub-block decoder is reduced to O(N/W), where W is the number of segmented sub-blocks. The decoding delay is approximately one-Wth that of a conventional MAP-based turbo-coding system. The cost paid is a slight degradation in bit error rate performance and a reasonable increase in hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698923","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

Similar concepts can be extended to distribute the memory banks into ACS units if the ACS units are scheduled correspondingly to keep the interconnection minimal.

This paper makes two contributions in the context of the 3-D CAP system. First, the QAM equivalent for the three-dimensional case is introduced by extending the 2-D complex notation into a 3-D vector notation. The definition is a modification of the well known quaternions. Second, the 3-D QAM filtering is redefined using algorithmic strength reduction to reduce the overall complexity by about one third with marginal degradation. The 3-D QAM system using 9 filters performs almost exactly as the 3-D CAP. Further complexity reduction is achieved by exploiting filtering reduction at the expense of only one dB of receiver SNR degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5627/15081/00698925.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"456 vol.4","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=698925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional equalization for the 3-D QAM system with strength reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","DSL","Filtering","Subscriber loops","Telephony","ISDN","Digital communication","Bit error rate","Throughput","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","equalisers","transceivers","subscriber loops","digital communication","filtering theory","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional equalization","3D QAM system","algorithmic strength reduction","3D CAP system","3D vector notation","3D QAM filtering","complexity reduction","carrierless amplitude/phase modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/698925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional equalization for the 3-D QAM system with strength reduction","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6021223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional equalization for the 3-D QAM system with strength reduction","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00698925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037749S","chronDate":"May 31 1998-June 3 1998","isNumber":"15081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5627","citationCount":"2","articleId":"698925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":698936,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The receiver determines the correlation (which is proportional to the energy per bit) in order to demodulate the received signal. Since a chaotic signal is not periodic, the energy per bit is not constant and can only be estimated, even in the noise-free case. This estimation has a non-zero variance that limits the attainable data rate. This problem can be avoided if the energy per bit is kept constant. In this paper, the DCSK technique is combined with frequency modulation in order to achieve two properties: the excellent noise performance of DCSK is maintained; in addition, the energy per bit is kept constant in order not to limit the data rate. A low-pass equivalent model that significantly speeds up the simulation of an FM-DCSK system is also developed. Finally the noise performance of the proposed FM-DCSK system is given.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698936","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

The chip weighting waveforms are designed for the purpose of multiple access interference (MAI) rejection by emphasizing the transitions of the received signal of interest. The WDW is determined only by one parameter, which leads to easy tuning of the WDW in practice to achieve the best performance. As a result, we show that the proposed receiver can reject MAI without knowing co-user's spreading codes, timing, and phase, and hence increase system capacity. Analysis and numerical results show that the proposed receiver outperforms the conventional receiver especially when MAI is significant. Finally, a discussion on the effect of bandlimited spreading signals is also given on the practical implications of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1998.698980","publicationTitle":"ISCAS '98.

We have already extended the coding method in their work to the case where intervals and trapezoidal membership functions can be used for antecedent fuzzy sets. There are, however, two drawbacks in these methods. One is that the resolution of each axis on which the fuzzy partition was adjusted should be prespecified by a decision-maker for genetic algorithms. The other is that the number of fuzzy if-then rules generated by these coding methods exponentially increases as the number of attributes increases. To cope with the first drawback, we propose a coding method using histograms where a distribution of training patterns is considered to specify the resolution of each axis. For the second drawback, we employ an input selection procedure. Using this procedure, our genetic-algorithm-based fuzzy partition method can be applied to high-dimensional pattern classification problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699066","startPage":"9","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

And the use of computer communication networks has been rapidly increasing in order to share expensive hardware/software resources and provide access to main system from distant locations. These network problems have many applications in telecommunications, computer networking, and the related domains in electric, gas, and sewer networks. Especially, in the computer networking, LANs are commonly used as the communication infrastructure that meets the demands of the users in local environment. These networks typically consist of several LAN segments connected together via bridges. The use of these transparent bridges requires loop-free paths between LAN segments. Therefore, only spanning tree topologies can be used as active LAN configurations. Recently, genetic algorithms have got a great advancement in related research fields, such as network optimization problem, combinatorial optimization, multiobjective optimization, and so on. Also genetic algorithm have received a great deal of attention about its ability as optimization techniques for many real-world problem. In this paper, we attempt to the topology design problem in LAN with bicriteria which is minimizing the cost and average message delay using spanning tree-based genetic algorithm, because the interconnection between the network service centers must yield spanning tree configurations. Finally, we get some experiments in order to certify the quality of the networks designs obtained by using spanning tree-based genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/699068/","accessionNumber":"6021031","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-9 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A spanning tree-based genetic algorithm for bicriteria topological network design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spanning tree-based genetic algorithm for bicriteria topological network design","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"00699068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035397S","chronDate":"4-9 May 1998","isNumber":"15048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621","citationCount":"22","articleId":"699068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":699070,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We present the radiation characteristics of a dipole positioned inside MPBG structures for which some wires have been suppressed to let the field propagate in privileged directions. These suppressed wires are then replaced by a new MPBG structure for which the field can propagate at the working frequency. The MPBG interface is structured to look like a corner reflector shape. The radiation characteristics versus frequency within a band-gap and versus reflector-dipole distances are presented and compared to simple and gridded corner reflector antenna characteristics. The same MPBC shape is analyzed outside bandgap, using propagation modes. Angular filtering characteristics can be improved when the MPBG interface is no longer a plane.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1998.699101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

In modern cellular, satellite mobile communications systems and in GPS systems, both desired and interfering signals change their directions continuously. This paper develops a fast tracking system to constantly track the users, and then adapt the radiation pattern of the antenna to direct multiple narrow beams to desired users and nulls to sources of interference. In the approach suggested here, the computation of the optimum weights is viewed as a mapping problem which can be modeled using a three-layer Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) trained with input/output pairs. The results obtained from this network are in excellent agreement with the Wiener solution. It was found that networks implementing these functions are successful in tracking mobile users as they move across the antenna's field of view.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.699109","startPage":"203","endPage":"206 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through \"genetic\" operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J. Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, these individuals are \"evolved\" by cooperation and competition among the individuals themselves through generations. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter, called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1998.699146","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

Normally, constructing an ISAR image requires data collection in both the frequency and the angular dimensions. If the data are evenly sampled and the sampling rate is dense enough, and provided that the total angular look on the target is small, an ISAR can be obtained by using a two dimensional FFT algorithm. In this paper, we address the case when the angular data are unevenly undersampled. Such a scenario may arise in real-world ISAR data collection when the target is fast manoeuvring or when the angular look on the target by the radar is not dense enough to satisfy the Nyquist sampling rate. We propose an algorithm to overcome the aliasing effect in the cross range dimension and construct ISAR images from seriously undersampled data. To verify the algorithm we reconstruct the radar image of a model VFY 218 aircraft.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1998.699152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

However, for antenna arrays of even modest size, the excessive computer storage and run-time may become prohibitive for design and optimisation purposes. Some work has been done with time-domain transform methods for computing weak coupling between antennas (Page et al. 1996). In this paper, an algorithm is developed using the Kirchhoff near-field to near-field transformation (Shlager and Smith, 1995) for the one-way coupling between antenna elements. This coupling representation is then applied to arrays in a manner analogous to an element-by-element analysis in the frequency domain, except that in the method described here the coupled currents at the antenna-feed ports are added in the time-domain so as to permit the introduction of true-time delays for wide-band beam steering. The advantages of the transform method over a full FDTD method are smaller computer storage and a reduction in late-time FDTD effects associated with reflections from the absorbing boundary on the outer surface of the computational domain and also from numerical dispersion and instabilities.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.699187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

We invoke the reciprocity principle to reduce a class of reflector antenna problems to an equivalent 2 1/2 -D type, even when the composite antenna system satisfies the azimuthal symmetry criterion only partially. Next, we describe how the FDTD is adapted to azimuthally-symmetric geometries, and discuss how we handle some of the problems encountered in the process of modeling the reflector antenna geometry. These problems include: (i) field singularities at the axis; (ii) excitation of a plane wave source; (iii) the use of nonuniform mesh in a cylindrical system; (iv) source excitation problem to minimize spurious reflections from the truncation boundaries; and, (v) extension of the orthogonal 2 1/2 -D algorithm to a conformal FDTD grid so that it can deal with a curved conductor as well dielectric surfaces.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

The key point for both techniques resides in using a new scheme of antenna excitation via a 3D model of a thin TEM line, terminated with a template source. This permits one to extract the return loss within the line by the differential method previously developed and well tested for S-parameter analysis in microwave circuits, and now enhanced with TEM template filtering. Another advantage of applying the template source is that it provides accurate control of power delivered to the antenna. The radiation efficiency can then be calculated directly, without the need to integrate dissipated power over the whole computational domain. Depending on the problem complexity, this reduces the computing time by up to a factor of two, and at the same time ensures the 0.8 % accuracy even for the discretization of 10 cells per wavelength.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements to parameter extraction techniques for FDTD simulations of handset antennas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

To make the numerical modeling of a periodic structure more practical, usually a single unit cell of the structure is modeled and periodic boundary conditions are used to incorporate the periodic nature. Traditionally, frequency-domain techniques are used to numerically model such structures because of the simple way in which the boundary condition can be applied. However, when broadband data is needed, a time-domain approach is desirable. Unfortunately, periodic boundary conditions in the time-domain introduce the need for time-advanced data, obviously a problem for a time-domain approach. To get around this, a field transformation can be applied which simplifies the boundary conditions, but results in a more complex set of equations to be solved. The FDTD algorithm can be applied to the transformed field equations; however, additional variables must be introduced because of stability considerations. One technique that has been developed for discretizing and solving the transformed field equations is the split-field method. This paper extends the method to include general anisotropic dielectric and magnetic media.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.699200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

It successfully employs the conventional FDTD method for most of the regular region but introduces the tetrahedral edge-based finite element scheme to model the region near the arbitrarily curved surfaces. Numerical results of early time simulation validate that the method has the advantages of accuracy, flexibility, stability, and computational efficiency. For the analyses of electromagnetic problems of high Q systems, transient response over a very long duration is necessary. It is found that the simulation may suffer from late-time instability and spurious DC modes. This paper is focused on treating the two drawbacks of the hybrid method.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1998.699202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1998 Digest.

Analysis of several microstrip and strip lines shows that the new equations are very stable, and the computed effective dielectric constant is significantly more accurate than with previous techniques.

The hybrid character of the GA lies in the application of a heuristic procedure to improve candidate solutions. The basic idea behind our heuristic is to identify and exploit clusters, i.e. subgraphs with a relatively high edge density. The resulting hybrid genetic algorithm turns out to be very effective, both in terms of quality of solutions and running time. On a large class of benchmark families of graphs, our hybrid genetic algorithm yields results of the same or better quality than those obtained by all other heuristic algorithms we are aware of, for comparable running times.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699328","startPage":"90","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

Improving antenna performance is not a straightforward process, as many (sometimes conflicting) design trade-offs must be considered.

We implement this approach of designing a wire antenna having optimal performance under user-defined adverse conditions by using a genetic algorithm, where the fitness of promising designs is analyzed using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) Version 4.1. Two versions of an integrated GA-NEC code are implemented; both produce geometries showing improvements over current designs.

In this paper, we propose a new routing algorithm called the Genetic Routing Algorithm (GRA) using genetic algorithms to find a sub-optimal routing solution for ATM networks. New encoding and selection mechanisms are proposed. After making suitable simplifying assumptions, simulations are carried out to implement and evaluate the proposed routing algorithm and compare it with other well-known algorithms. We found that GRA distributes the traffic load among all VPs fairly and hence minimizes both the average cell delay and the average cell loss probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699332","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

However, its performance is limited by the existence of multiuser interference energy (MI), which results in the so called near-far problem. To reduce the MI effect, different decorrelating structures for multiuser detection have been proposed. For the asynchronous case, the \"one-shot decorrelator\" was proposed, based on inversion of the partial correlation matrix, which may however be singular. As an alternative, the so-called \"multi-shot decorrelator\", which does not suffer from the aforementioned singularities, was also suggested. However, both detectors, based on inversion of some matrix, are not robust to errors in the users' relative delays. The application of the adaptive \"bootstrap algorithm\" with the one-shot structure proved to easily handle variation in delay estimates and outperform the decorrelating detector. We propose and compare a bootstrap algorithm suitable for the multi-shot matched filtering, multiuser detector in a multipath environment, examine its performance, and compare it to that of other detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/699341/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6141979","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Implementing the bootstrap algorithm to multi-shot matched filtering, multiuser detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing the bootstrap algorithm to multi-shot matched filtering, multiuser detection","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00699341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090234S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1998","isNumber":"15163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5631","citationCount":"1","articleId":"699341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":699345,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Following the derivation of the ensemble weight enumeration functions of random parallel and serial concatenated codes, improved upper bounds on the bit and message error probabilities of these ensembles of codes are derived and the influence of the interleaver length N and the memory length of the component codes m are investigated. The improved bounding technique proposed here, which is based on the tangential-sphere bound, is compared to the conventional union bound and to a recent alternative bounding technique by Duman and Salehi (1997) which incorporates modified Gallager bounds. The advantage of the derived bounds is demonstrated, especially in the region above the cutoff rate, including thus a portion of the rate region where the performance of turbo codes is most appealing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/699347/","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6141985","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distance spectrum based improved upper bounds for parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance spectrum based improved upper bounds for parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00699347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059634S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1998","isNumber":"15163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5631","citationCount":"3","articleId":"699347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":699349,"authors":[{"name":"Z.H.

Problem formulation and design of ANN for loss analysis is described. Due to the capability of parallel information processing of the ANN, the proposed method is fast and yet accurate. Active and reactive powers of generators and loads, as well as the magnitudes of voltages at voltage-controlled buses are chosen as inputs to the ANN. System power losses are chosen as the outputs. Training data are obtained by load flow studies. Load flow studies for different system topologies are carried out and the results are compiled to form the training set. Numerical results are presented in the study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed.","doi":"10.1109/MELCON.1998.699394","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1065 vol.2","publicationTitle":"MELECON '98. 9th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference.

The method is applied to obtain the expressions of the first and second order sensitivities. These sensitivities with the conjugated gradient can be used as a basis for the process optimization. As an illustration, the minimization of losses in a power system is presented.

Diagnostic procedure is based upon many facts gathered through the process of various examinations. Important information can be gathered by visual examination of tissue samples using a microscope. This paper presents one method for automatic analysis of microscopic bone marrow images in order to help physicians in the diagnosis of reactive histiocytosis. Morphological parameters of bone marrow cells are measured by the means of digital image processing and after that measured parameters are analyzed using a neural network to produce helpful diagnostic informations. By just a visual examination a physician can only estimate cell parameters, so the diagnostic procedure is mostly based on his experience. Using the described automatic system, relevant parameters can be precisely measured and a neural network is used to accumulate and keep the physician's experience and knowledge so that correct conclusions can be made.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/699483/","accessionNumber":"6135161","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cell classification for diagnostic of reactive histocytic hyperplasia using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell classification for diagnostic of reactive histocytic hyperplasia using neural networks","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00699483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05969S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1998","isNumber":"15163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5631","citationCount":"1","articleId":"699483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":699492,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The objective is to maximise the total number of batches processed per year in the facility. In addition, two-objective optimisation search was implemented, using several evolutionary computation methods. One additional objective is to minimise the overall cost, which is proportional to the number of cells in the facility. The multi-objective optimisation programs were based on three approaches: the weighted-sum approach, the Pareto-optimality approach, and the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEC.1998.699492","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

Each request has a single source with one or more destinations. Furthermore, different requests may have different source and different destination nodes. Finding optimal routing for a set of requests is called the point to multipoint routing problem (PMRP). The current practice in solving the PMRP is to consider each point to multipoint request as a collection of point to point requests, and then solve each paint to point request. This is very costly and generally produces poor results. The paper presents an algorithm for the point to multipoint routing problem that uses a genetic algorithm and a heuristic Steiner tree algorithm. The genetic algorithm allows the scheduler to find an optimal or near-optimal path through the network for each request. In the algorithm each request is treated as a whole and not as a collection of point to point requests. Furthermore, given a set of point to multipoint routing requests, the algorithm considers various subsets sizes of the original set of requests and produces an optimal or near-optimal ordering of the requests for the specified subset size. They run the PMRP algorithm on several test cases with excellent results.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699496","pdfPath":"/iel4/5621/15048/00699496.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.

A time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol is adopted for conflict free communication. The goal is to find a conflict free transmission schedule for different nodes at different time slots of a fixed length time cycle, called the TDMA cycle. The optimization criterion is primarily to minimize the TDMA cycle length, and then to maximize the number of transmissions. First a classical genetic algorithm is used to solve this NP-complete problem, but showed poor performance for bigger networks. Then the authors proposed some special crossover operators suitable for this kind of problem. This modified operator could deliver very good quality results even for big networks and in few generations. A study on the dependence of the result on population size etc. is carried out. The results are empirically compared with other approaches, a greedy-heuristic algorithm and mean field annealing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 May 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/699498/","accessionNumber":"6021055","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-9 May 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for broadcast scheduling in packet radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for broadcast scheduling in packet radio networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"00699498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161464S","chronDate":"4-9 May 1998","isNumber":"15048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5621","citationCount":"16","articleId":"699498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":699502,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

In this paper, a computer-aided detection and classification method (CADCM) for concealed targets is proposed. It is fully computer-automated and requires no a priori information at all. It consists of three successive processes: (1) a band selection procedure; (2) a band ratioing approach; and (3) an automatic target detection and classification algorithm (ATDCA). The effectiveness of the proposed CADCM is evaluated by HYperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) image scenes. The results show that targets which are concealed by shade, natural background or covered by man-made objects can be effectively detected and further classified by CADCM.","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS '98.

As the simulation of CNNs necessitates the numerical integration of large systems of nonlinear differential equations, the evaluation of the fitness functions is computationally very expensive; a massively parallel supercomputer is used to achieve acceptable run times.","doi":"10.1109/ICEC.1998.699763","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation Proceedings.
