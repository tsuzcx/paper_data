Since the data stream is likely to change over time, it is important to be able to modify the outlier detection model appropriately with the evolution of the stream. Most existing approaches were using incremental or periodical models to deal with evolving stream data. However, in these approaches, model updates were either more frequently and risk wasting resources on insignificant changes or more infrequently and risk model inaccuracy. In this paper, a hybrid framework by combining LOF (local outlier factor) and BPNN (back propagation neural network), appropriate for online detecting outliers in data streams, is proposed. The proposed framework provides equivalent detection performance as the iterated static LOF algorithm (applied after insertion of each data record), while requiring significantly less computational time.","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770026","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752633/4769956/04770026.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769956","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Reactive Anomaly Detection over Stream Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Reactive Anomaly Detection over Stream Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770026/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458356","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770026/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Reactive Anomaly Detection over Stream Data","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICACIA-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048691S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752633","isNumber":"4769956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752633","xplore-issue":"4769956","articleId":"4770026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4770028,"authors":[{"name":"Da-Peng Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Da-Peng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37671141100"},{"name":"Xiao-Song Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Song","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598091300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3426-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3427-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770028","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"Recent attacks demonstrated that network intrusions have become a major threat to Internet. Systems are employed to detect internet anomaly play a vital role in Internet security. To solve this problem, a technique called frequent episode rules (FERs) base on data mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where only pure frequent episode rule is used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752633/4769956/04770028.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet Anomaly Detection with Weighted Fuzzy Matching over Frequent Episode Rules","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Data mining","IP networks","Machine learning","Face detection","Data security","Databases","Information security","Web and internet services","Association rules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fuzzy set theory","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet anomaly detection","weighted fuzzy matching algorithm","network intrusion","Internet security","frequent episode rules","data mining","machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet security","Anomaly detection","weighted fuzzy matching","Frequent episode rule","Traffic data mining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Internet Anomaly Detection with Weighted Fuzzy Matching over Frequent Episode Rules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770028/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458358","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internet Anomaly Detection with Weighted Fuzzy Matching over Frequent Episode Rules","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICACIA-00-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067589S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752633","isNumber":"4769956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752633","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4769956","articleId":"4770028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4770047,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Kong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Kong","id":"38188244400"},{"name":"Jian-Ming Liao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Ming","lastName":"Liao","id":"37667850400"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","International Centre for Wavelet Analysis and Its Applications, Logistical Engineering University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"37405662600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3426-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3427-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770047","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Application software","Neural networks","Equations","Computer graphics","Computer science","Wavelet analysis","Electronic mail","Computer interfaces","Neurofeedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","backpropagation","graphical user interfaces","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network","application program graphic-interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphic-interface","style","BP-neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770047","abstract":"With the interface from words to graphic, the quality of application program is more and more depend on the degree which the graphic interface feat the taste of the users.

In the distributed manufacturing environment, it becomes a more intractable one with the characters of distributed object, multiple target and strong dynamic. A novel distribution jobshop scheduling method based on multi-agent mechanism and genetic algorithm is presented. A distributed scheduling system framework, which composed of several jobshop agents, task agents, and resource agents, is established firstly. With the distribution of agents, the complex distributed scheduling problem is transformed into several sub-problems, such as local optimization scheduling of individual agent and global optimization of the multi-agent system. Then, a hybrid genetic algorithm is elaborated to support agents to do their scheduling decisions. In order to further improve capacities of the algorithm, a new solution is proposed, which allowing agents to participate in the optimizing process of the genetic algorithm. Finally, a prototype system for multi-shop distributed scheduling is developed and the simulation results are given to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770054","startPage":"404","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4769956","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Apperceiving Computing and Intelligence Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/4752633/4769956/04770054.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Agent and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Approach for Distributed Jobshop Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770054/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Agent and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Approach for Distributed Jobshop Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770054/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10458384","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Agent and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Approach for Distributed Jobshop Scheduling","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICACIA-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034441S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4752633","isNumber":"4769956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4752633","xplore-issue":"4769956","articleId":"4770054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4770093,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Cheng","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/5614813/4770093/4770093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Cheng received the BS and MS degrees from Peking University, China, and the PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

High-dimensional data typically have much more variables than observations, and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Features extracted from high-dimensional data need to be discriminative, sparse, and can capture essential characteristics of the data. In this paper, we present a way to constructing multivariate features and then classify the data into proper classes. The resulting small subset of features is nearly the best in the sense of Greenshtein's persistence; however, the estimated feature weights may be biased. We take a systematic approach for correcting the biases. We use conjugate gradient-based primal-dual interior-point techniques for large-scale problems. We apply our procedure to microarray gene analysis. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sparse Learning Machine for High-Dimensional Data with Application to Microarray Gene Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2009.8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/5614813/04770093.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2009.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Sparse Learning Machine for High-Dimensional Data with Application to Microarray Gene Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4770093/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11623393","pubMedId":"21030731","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sparse Learning Machine for High-Dimensional Data with Application to Microarray Gene Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttb2010040636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106989S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"5614813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5614813","articleId":"4770093","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4770098,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey M.

In spite of its prevalence, little work has been done to study this visualization paradigm as a methodology in its own right. We provide a historical review of radial visualization, tracing it to its roots in centuries-old statistical graphics. We then identify the types of problem domains to which modern radial visualization techniques have been applied. A taxonomy for radial visualization is proposed in the form of seven design patterns encompassing nearly all recent works in this area. From an analysis of these patterns, we distill a series of design considerations that system builders can use to create new visualizations that address aspects of the design space that have not yet been explored. It is hoped that our taxonomy will provide a framework for facilitating discourse among researchers and stimulate the development of additional theories and systems involving radial visualization as a distinct design metaphor.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5165577/04770098.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Radial Methods for Information Visualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770098/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Radial Methods for Information Visualization","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10780746","pubMedId":"19590103","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770098/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Radial Methods for Information Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2009050759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178561S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5165577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"5165577","articleId":"4770098","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4770100,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4976428/4770100/4770100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaochun Wang received the BS degree from Beijing University and the PhD degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University.

The new formulation is shown to be closely related to a number of classical principles for the organization of perceptual systems, including infomax, inference by detection of suspicious coincidences, classification with minimal uncertainty, and classification with minimum probability of error. The implementation of these principles with computational parsimony, by exploitation of the statistics of natural images, is investigated. It is shown that Barlow's principle of inference by the detection of suspicious coincidences enables computationally efficient saliency measures which are nearly optimal for classification. This principle is adopted for the solution of the two fundamental problems in discriminant saliency, feature selection and saliency detection. The resulting saliency detector is shown to have a number of interesting properties, and act effectively as a focus of attention mechanism for the selection of interest points according to their relevance for visual recognition. Experimental evidence shows that the selected points have good performance with respect to 1) the ability to localize objects embedded in significant amounts of clutter, 2) the ability to capture information relevant for image classification, and 3) the richness of the set of visual attributes that can be considered salient.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4816105/04770107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816105","startPage":"989","endPage":"1005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant Saliency, the Detection of Suspicious Coincidences, and Applications to Visual Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant Saliency, the Detection of Suspicious Coincidences, and Applications to Visual Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10575232","pubMedId":"19372605","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770107/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant Saliency, the Detection of Suspicious Coincidences, and Applications to Visual Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2009060989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048795S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"4816105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"208","articleId":"4770107","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4770108,"authors":[{"name":"Tib\u00e9rio S.

In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide. We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are pairs of graphs and the 'labels' are matches between them. Our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4816105/04770108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816105","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Graph Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning Graph Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770108/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10587256","pubMedId":"19372609","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Graph Matching","sourcePdf":"ttp2009061048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095287S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4816105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4816105","articleId":"4770108","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4770110,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Witzner Hansen","affiliation":["IT-University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5392960/4770110/4770110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Witzner Hansen received the PhD degree from the IT University of Copenhagen and is currently working as an associate professor in the Innovative Communications Group at that university.

This paper considers algorithms for counterexample generation for probabilistic CTL formulae in discrete-time Markov chains. Finding the strongest evidence (i.e., the most probable path) violating a (bounded) until-formula is shown to be reducible to a single-source (hop-constrained) shortest path problem. Counterexamples of smallest size that deviate most from the required probability bound can be obtained by applying (small amendments to) k-shortest (hop-constrained) paths algorithms. These results can be extended to Markov chains with rewards, to LTL model checking, and are useful for Markov decision processes. Experimental results show that typically the size of a counterexample is excessive. To obtain much more compact representations, we present a simple algorithm to generate (minimal) regular expressions that can act as counterexamples. The feasibility of our approach is illustrated by means of two communication protocols: leader election in an anonymous ring network and the Crowds protocol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770111/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","publicationDate":"March-April 2009","accessionNumber":"10547539","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Counterexample Generation in Probabilistic Model Checking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counterexample Generation in Probabilistic Model Checking","sourcePdf":"tts2009020241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124807S","chronDate":"March-April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"4809708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4809708","articleId":"4770111","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4770113,"authors":[{"name":"Haris E.

The overall scheme can be considered as a sampled-data adaptive neural control system. As an intermediate result, it is proven that, for a sufficiently small sampling period, the emulated adaptive neural controller i.e., the discrete implementation of the continuous-time adaptive neural network controller ensures semiglobal uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. Then, based on the exact discrete-time model, a controller redesign is proposed that performs efficiently for sampling periods for which the emulation controller fails. The redesigned controller consists of two terms: the emulated control law and an extra robustness term designed to increase the order of the perturbation (with respect to the sampling period) in the Lyapunov difference. In all cases, high-order neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearities. Using Lyapunov techniques, it is proven that, for a sufficiently small sampling period, the proposed redesigned controller ensures the (semiglobal) boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop while the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed scheme with respect to the emulation controller and verify the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2006981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2006981","startPage":"336","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4776562/04770113.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled-Data Adaptive NN Tracking Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data Adaptive NN Tracking Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770113/","accessionNumber":"10471903","pubMedId":"19188120","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770113/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data Adaptive NN Tracking Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tnn-psillakis-2006981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093711S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4776562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4776562","articleId":"4770113","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4770118,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404133500"},{"name":"Jianqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Jianqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280538300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4770118","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband communication","Biological system modeling","Ultra wideband technology","Biosensors","RAKE receivers","Frequency","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Humans","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocommunications","error statistics","finite difference time-domain analysis","physiological models","telecommunication links","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband communication link","on-body chest-to-waist link","biotical sensor","coordinator receiver","finite difference time domain method","realistic-shaped human body model","body postures","bit error rate","RAKE receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","channel model","on-body propagation","ultra wideband (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"On-body area ultra wideband (UWB) communication is promising for biomedical applications.

The proposed LNA has comparable NF and gain, while it can operate under the lowest power among the published works in 0.18 mum CMOS technology for K-band applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","K-band","Noise measurement","Feedback","CMOS technology","Impedance matching","Inductors","Noise figure","Energy consumption","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","circuit noise","CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","MMIC","MMIC amplifiers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-band low noise amplifier","transformer feedback","noise figure","current-reused technique","power gain","LNA","CMOS technology","frequency 22 GHz","noise figure 4.3 dB","gain 10.1 dB","voltage 1.8 V","power 7.2 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current-reused","low noise amplifier (LNA)","noise figure (NF)","transformer feedback"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2008.2011340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4781989/04770122.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4781989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2008.2011340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Power Low-Noise Amplifier for K-Band Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power Low-Noise Amplifier for K-Band Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770122/","volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770122/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10473081","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power Low-Noise Amplifier for K-Band Applications","sourcePdf":"lmwc-hsu-2011340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044553S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4781989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4781989","articleId":"4770122","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4770127,"authors":[{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5208599/4770127/4770127-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shamik Sengupta received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, Orlando, in 2007.","He is a Postdoctorate Researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ.

Such market mechanisms will lead to competition among WSPs where they not only compete to acquire spectrum but also attract and retain users. Currently, there is little understanding on how such a dynamic trading system will operate so as to make the system feasible under economic terms. In this paper, we propose an economic framework that can be used to guide i) the dynamic spectrum allocation process and ii) the service pricing mechanisms that the providers can use. We propose a knapsack based auction model that dynamically allocates spectrum to the WSPs such that revenue and spectrum usage are maximized. We borrow techniques from game theory to capture the conflict of interest between WSPs and end users. A dynamic pricing strategy for the providers is also proposed. We show that even in a greedy and non-cooperative behavioral game model, it is in the best interest of the WSPs to adhere to a price and channel threshold which is a direct consequence of price equilibrium. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed auction model entices WSPs to participate in the auction, makes optimal use of the spectrum, and avoids collusion among WSPs. We demonstrate how pricing can be used as an effective tool for providing incentives to the WSPs to upgrade their network resources and offer better services.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.2007758","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5208599/04770127.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.2007758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Economic Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access and Service Pricing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770127/","displayDocTitle":"An Economic Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access and Service Pricing","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828350","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770127/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Economic Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Access and Service Pricing","sourcePdf":"17tnet05-mchatterjee-2007758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086479S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5208599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5208599","articleId":"4770127","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770130,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Yu Heh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ding Yu","lastName":"Heh","id":"37579567300"},{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng Leong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37272187200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"4770130","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a finite-difference time-domain formulation to model electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media using matrix exponential method.

The method is generic and targeted towards large-scale linear inverse problems, such as 3-D deconvolution microscopy. The algorithm is derived within the framework of bound optimization. The key idea is to successively update the coefficients in the various wavelet channels using fixed, subband-adapted iteration parameters (step sizes and threshold levels). The optimization problem is solved efficiently via a proper chaining of basic iteration modules. The higher level description of the algorithm is similar to that of a multigrid solver for PDEs, but there is one fundamental difference: the latter iterates though a sequence of multiresolution versions of the original problem, while, in our case, we cycle through the wavelet subspaces corresponding to the difference between successive approximations. This strategy is motivated by the special structure of the problem and the preconditioning properties of the wavelet representation. We establish that the solution of the restoration problem corresponds to a fixed point of our multilevel optimizer. We also provide experimental evidence that the improvement in convergence rate is essentially determined by the (unconstrained) linear part of the algorithm, irrespective of the type of wavelet. Finally, we illustrate the technique with some image deconvolution examples, including some real 3-D fluorescence microscopy data.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2008073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4782056/04770145.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2008073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Multilevel Algorithm for Wavelet-Regularized Image Restoration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Multilevel Algorithm for Wavelet-Regularized Image Restoration","volume":"18","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10473747","pubMedId":"19188124","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770145/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770145/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Multilevel Algorithm for Wavelet-Regularized Image Restoration","sourcePdf":"tip-vonesch-2008073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126513S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4782056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4782056","articleId":"4770145","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4770147,"authors":[{"name":"Rimoon Agaiby","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Rimoon","lastName":"Agaiby","id":"37628399800"},{"name":"Peter Hofmann","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"38187786900"},{"name":"Dayu Zhou","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Dayu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403108300"},{"name":"Martin Kerber","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kerber","id":"37284232000"},{"name":"Johannes Heitmann","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Heitmann","id":"37294379400"},{"name":"Uwe Schroeder","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Schroeder","id":"37274916900"},{"name":"Eike Erben","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Eike","lastName":"Erben","id":"38185982900"},{"name":"Lars Oberbeck","affiliation":["Qimonda Dresden GmbH and Company OHG, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Oberbeck","id":"37316898300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4770147","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Voltage","High-K gate dielectrics","High K dielectric materials","Monitoring","Stress","MIM capacitors","Electrodes","Random access memory","Electric breakdown"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","reliability","silicon compounds","zirconium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lifetime acceleration model","DRAM technology","long-term reliability","voltage acceleration model","soft-breakdown behavior","SILC","ZrO2-SiO2-ZrO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long-term TDDB","MIM capacitor"," $\\hbox{ZrO}_{2}$"]}],"abstract":"Long-term reliability results over six orders of magnitude in time are presented showing that the voltage acceleration model for ZrO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n/SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n/ZrO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n exhibits an exponential dependence with voltage, down to 2 V.

Schemes for point clouds operate only on the geometric data and, hence, are generic and applicable to mesh-based representations of 3-D models. For building generic copyright schemes for 3-D models, this paper presents a robust blind watermarking mechanism for 3-D point-sampled geometry. The basic idea is to find a cluster tree from clusters of 3-D points. Using the cluster tree, watermarks can be embedded and extracted by deriving an order among points at global (intracluster) and local levels (intercluster). The multiple bit watermarks are encoded/decoded inside each cluster based on an extension of the cluster structure-based 3-D quantization index modulation. The encoding mechanism makes the technique robust against uniform affine transformations (rotation, scaling, and transformation), reordering, cropping, simplification, and noise addition attacks. The technique when applied to 3-D meshes also achieves robustness against retriangulation and progressive compression techniques. Customization of the bit-encoding scheme achieves high hiding capacity with embedding rates that are equal to 4 b/point, while maintaining the imperceptibility of the watermark with low distortions.

In this paper, we present a self-contained public key-management scheme, a scalable method of cryptographic key management (SMOCK), which achieves almost zero communication overhead for authentication, and offers high service availability. In our scheme, a small number of cryptographic keys are stored offline at individual nodes before they are deployed in the network. To provide good scalability in terms of the number of nodes and storage space, we utilize a combinatorial design of public-private key pairs, which means nodes combine more than one key pair to encrypt and decrypt messages. We also show that SMOCK provides controllable resilience when malicious nodes compromise a limited number of nodes before key revocation and renewal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10473237","htmlLink":"/document/4770150/","displayDocTitle":"SMOCK: A Scalable Method of Cryptographic Key Management for Mission-Critical Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMOCK: A Scalable Method of Cryptographic Key Management for Mission-Critical Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-he-2009601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09358S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4782049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4782049","articleId":"4770150","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4770151,"authors":[{"name":"Iyad Dajani","affiliation":["High Power Solid State Lasers Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Iyad Dajani received the B.A. degree in physics and applied mathematics, the M.S. degree in engineering science, and the Ph.D. degree in nuclear engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.","From 1993 to 1995, he was a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow.

Optimization of amplifier action through wavelength separation and/or seed power ratios is considered in relation to the two most dominant nonlinear effects: stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and four-wave mixing. One approach uses a large wavelength separation among the input signals, while the other approach entails that the wavelength separation is set to twice the Brillouin shift. Both techniques are shown to mitigate SBS effects, although for the latter case, four-wave mixing sidebands can carry a substantial amount of power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Brillouin scattering","Optical fibers","Optical amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Four-wave mixing","Frequency conversion","Power generation","Power lasers","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwave mixing","optical fibre amplifiers","stimulated Brillouin scattering","ytterbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear effects","high-power amplifiers","optical fibre amplifiers","multitone seeding","four-wave mixing","stimulated Brillouin scattering","wavelength separation","Brillouin shift","Jk:Yb"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Four-wave mixing","nonlinear optics","stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)","Yb-doped fiber amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2008.2011497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/4811094/04770151.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4811094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2008.2011497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Nonlinear Effects in Multitone-Driven Narrow-Linewidth High-Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Nonlinear Effects in Multitone-Driven Narrow-Linewidth High-Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770151/","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-april 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770151/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10558189","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Nonlinear Effects in Multitone-Driven Narrow-Linewidth High-Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jstqe-dajani-2011497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056018S","chronDate":"March-april  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4811094","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4811094","articleId":"4770151","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4770155,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Gehrig","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Group, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4782056/4770155/4770155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Gehrig (M'04) received the M.S. in communication systems degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in March 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London, U.K., in March 2008, where he was a research student in the Communications and Signal Processing Group from 2003 to 2007.","From September to December 2005, he was a visiting scholar at the BASiCS Research Group, EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley.

This process is frequently manually performed-which is a laborious task in many situations-as automatic image registration methods are still far from being broadly applied. One of the reasons that justify the absence of a broad application of automatic image registration methods is the lack of measures for an objective and automated analysis of the image registration process quality. The root mean square (RMS) of the residuals is the only quantitative evaluation which is generally used in this process, with the final validation of the geometric correction process being a qualitative analysis. Therefore, in both ldquohumanrdquo and automatic image registration processes, an objective evaluation of its quality is required. In this letter, we propose several measures for an objective evaluation of the geometric correction process, as a complement to the traditional RMS of the residuals and visual inspection. Two scenarios of control point distribution and the most common residual distributions were considered. With the proposed measures, we intend to cover the most common qualitative analysis aspects. This has particular importance under the scope of automatic image registration methods, where an automatic evaluation of the results is also required.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measures for an Objective Evaluation of the Geometric Correction Process Quality","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2012441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4814847/04770160.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2012441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Measures for an Objective Evaluation of the Geometric Correction Process Quality","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4770160/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572771","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measures for an Objective Evaluation of the Geometric Correction Process Quality","sourcePdf":"lgrs-gonalves-2012441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052462S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4814847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4814847","articleId":"4770160","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770161,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Hijazi","affiliation":["Image and Signal Department, GIPSA Laboratory, Saint-Martin d'Heres, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4814882/4770161/4770161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hussein Hijazi received the Diploma degree in computer and communications engineering from the Lebanese University, Beyrouth, Lebanon, in 2004 and the Master's degree in signal, image, and speech, and telecommunications and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing and communications both from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG), Grenoble, France, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Typically, pilot symbols are strategically placed at various times over various subcarriers in order to calculate sample channel estimates, and then these estimates are interpolated or extrapolated forward to provide channel estimates where no pilot data was transmitted. Performance is highly dependent on the distribution of the pilots with respect to the coherence time and coherence bandwidth of the channel, and on the chosen channel parameterization. In this paper, a vector formulation of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for biased estimators and for functions of parameters is used to derive a lower bound on the channel estimation and prediction error of such a system. Numerical calculations using the bound demonstrate the benefits of multiple antennas for channel estimation and prediction and illustrate the impact of modeling errors on estimation performance when using channel models based on calibrated arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Bounds for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2014269","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04770162.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2014269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Bounds for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4770162/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572982","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Bounds for MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"57tsp05-mlarsen-2014269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110628S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4770162","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770163,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4814882/4770163/4770163-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaibin Huang (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng.

Due to its efficiency, beamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wireless communication standards. Prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts the block fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels is neglected. In this paper, we consider temporally correlated channels and design single-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. Analytical results concerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order finite-state Markov chain. These results include the information rate of the CSI quantizer output, the bit rate a CSI feedback channel is required to support, and the effect of feedback delay on throughput. In particular, based on the theory of Markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce the throughput gain due to CSI feedback at least exponentially. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for CSI feedback compression in time. Combining the results in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedback beamforming as demonstrated by a design example.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2014272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04770163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2014272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Over Temporally-Correlated Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Over Temporally-Correlated Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572979","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770163/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback Beamforming Over Temporally-Correlated Channels","sourcePdf":"57tsp05-khuang-2014272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12449S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4770163","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770164,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew A.

Distributed arithmetic coding provides several advantages over existing Slepian-Wolf coders, especially good performance at small block lengths, and the ability to incorporate arbitrary source models in the encoding process, e.g., context-based statistical models, in much the same way as a classical arithmetic coder.

Matching signal processing complexity to the actual correlation conditions and, thus, to the achievable performance is possible with a superset of MRC and BF known as maximal-ratio eigencombining (MREC). For imperfectly known and correlated fading gains, new closed-form expressions are derived for the probability density function of the MREC-output SNR, as well as for the outage probability (OP) and the average error probability. These new expressions permit seamless evaluation for any correlation value of MREC, MRC, and BF performance measures, such as the amount of fading, the deep-fade probability, diversity and array gains, and the OP. Our results confirm that, in realistic scenarios, adaptive MREC can achieve MRC-like performance for BF-like complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2014167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04770167.pdf","startPage":"3383","endPage":"3395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2014167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and Complexity Analysis of Eigencombining, Statistical Beamforming, and Maximal-Ratio Combining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770167/","displayDocTitle":"Performance and Complexity Analysis of Eigencombining, Statistical Beamforming, and Maximal-Ratio Combining","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829116","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770167/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and Complexity Analysis of Eigencombining, Statistical Beamforming, and Maximal-Ratio Combining","sourcePdf":"tvt-siriteanu-2014167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077623S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4770167","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770168,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hsiao Yih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Tamsui, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5204505/4770168/4770168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Hsiao Yih received the B.S. degree in control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","From 2003 to 2005, he was a Senior IC Design Engineer with Genesys Logic Inc.

However, the direct-conversion receiver architecture often suffers from direct current (dc) offset, which is a consequence of the imperfect direct-conversion process. In this paper, we study the effects of dc offset on the symbol error rate (SER) performance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Since OFDM system performance is sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO), the CFO must be estimated and compensated at the receiver. Due to CFO compensation, the dc offset caused by direct-conversion receivers and/or mixed-signal circuits no longer only affects the dc subcarrier and is spread over all subcarriers. By deriving the analytical SER formulas for OFDM systems with various modulation formats, the dependency of SER on dc offset and CFO is clearly quantified. These SER formulas can help system designers determine suitable specifications of RF components and understand whether digital DC offset compensation is necessary or not. Finally, we propose and analyze a simple DC offset estimation and cancellation scheme under the assumption that DC offset holds constant in one OFDM symbol duration. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DC offset-cancellation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2014240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04770168.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2014240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","startPage":"3436","endPage":"3446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Compensation of DC Offset in OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Compensation of DC Offset in OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770168/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829118","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770168/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Compensation of DC Offset in OFDM Systems Over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yih-2014240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083097S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4770168","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770171,"authors":[{"name":"Hongli Dong","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Daqing Petroleum Institute, Daqing, China","Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4808359/4770171/4770171-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongli Dong received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and technology from Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2000, and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and engineering from Daqing Petroleum Institute, Daqing, China, in 2003.

It provides the benefits of variable speed operation cost-effectively, and can control its active and reactive power independently. Crowbar protection is often adopted to protect the rotor-side voltage source converter (VSC) from transient overcurrent during grid voltage dip. But under unbalanced grid voltage condition, the severe problems are not the transient overcurrent, but the electric torque pulsation and dc voltage ripple in the back-to-back VSCs. This paper develops dynamic models in MATLAB/Simulink, validates it through experiments, investigates the behavior of DFIG during unbalanced grid voltage condition, and proposes new controllers in separated positive and negative sequence. Methods to separate positive and negative sequence components in real time are also developed, and their responses to unsymmetrical voltage dip are compared. Simulation results prove that the separated positive and negative sequence controllers limit the torque pulsation and dc voltage ripple effectively. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10479067","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Operation of Grid-Connected DFIG Under Unbalanced Grid Voltage Condition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of Grid-Connected DFIG Under Unbalanced Grid Voltage Condition","sourcePdf":"tec-zhou-2011833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032002S","chronDate":"March  2009","isNumber":"4785258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"187","articleId":"4770180","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4770183,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xue","affiliation":["Industrial Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, General Electric Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4785249/4770183/4770183-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Xue (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.E. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, the M.Phil. degree from the University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, and the Ph.D. degree in decision science and engineering systems from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2004.","Since 2004, he has been an Information Scientist with the Industrial Artificial Intelligence Lab., General Electric Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY.

Product-development cost, lead time, and reliability are very critical elements in addition to functional features. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to obtain an optimal decision with respect to these multiple criteria as the number of involved entities increases in modern product developments. There is a clear need for planning tools to support effective decision making in this domain. The availability of efficient and accurate multiobjective optimization (MOO) algorithms becomes critical in such a decision support tool. This paper poses the product development as a multiobjective assignment problem in the context of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) industry. We describe a new class of MOO algorithm based on the principles of differential evolution (DE). The multiobjective DE (MODE) algorithm is shown to approach Pareto-optimal solutions in a wide class of problems with better performance than the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II from the literature, providing a practical tool for product-development decision support. A decision support system based on the object-oriented design methodology is described in this paper with the MODE as the core search engine. Experimental study of this decision support system is conducted using two real-world PCBA designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed MODE algorithm and some use cases of such decision support system on facilitating decision makers' tradeoff analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2010791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.2010791","startPage":"309","endPage":"320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4785249/04770183.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Evolutionary Decision Support for Design\u2013Supplier\u2013Manufacturing Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Evolutionary Decision Support for Design\u2013Supplier\u2013Manufacturing Planning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770183/","accessionNumber":"10475331","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770183/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Evolutionary Decision Support for Design\u2013Supplier\u2013Manufacturing Planning","sourcePdf":"tsmca-xue-2010791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086966S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4785249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4785249","articleId":"4770183","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4770185,"authors":[{"name":"Luzheng Bi","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Vehicular Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4796392/4770185/4770185-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luzheng Bi (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Pedestrian detection distance with night-vision systems has been modeled based on image metrics.

In this paper, we first describe a model of the probability of pedestrian detection, which compares several combinations of image-based clutter, contrast, and pedestrian size metrics using a simple mathematical equation. Next, we describe a model of the probability of pedestrian detection as a function of distance and image-based metrics by combining the model of pedestrian-detection probability and a model that represents the relationship between the distance to a pedestrian and an image-based pedestrian size metric. In the final model, image-based metrics are used to predict pedestrian-detection performance and can also be used to evaluate and support the development of night-vision systems in vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2008.2011719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4796392/04770185.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2008.2011719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Image-Based Metrics to Model Pedestrian Detection Performance With Night-Vision Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770185/","displayDocTitle":"Using Image-Based Metrics to Model Pedestrian Detection Performance With Night-Vision Systems","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10501764","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770185/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Image-Based Metrics to Model Pedestrian Detection Performance With Night-Vision Systems","sourcePdf":"tits-bi-2011719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071338S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4796392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4796392","articleId":"4770185","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770186,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-ichi Meguro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4796392/4770186/4770186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-ichi Meguro received the B.Eng., M.Eng., and D.Eng. degrees from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","Since 2006, he has been a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow with the Advanced Research Institute for Science and Engineering, Waseda University.

The proposed technique mitigates Global Positioning System (GPS) multipath by means of an omnidirectional infrared (IR) camera that can eliminate the need for invisible satellites [a satellite detected by the receiver but without line of sight (LOS)] by using IR images. Some simple GPS multipath mitigation techniques, such as the installation of antennas away from buildings and using choke ring antennas, are well known. Further, various correlator techniques can also be employed. However, when a direct signal cannot be received by the antenna, these techniques do not provide satisfactory results because they presume that the antenna chiefly receives direct signals. On the other hand, the proposed technique can mitigate GPS multipath, even if a direct signal cannot be received because it can recognize the surrounding environment by means of an omnidirectional IR camera. With the IR camera, the sky appears distinctively dark; this facilitates the detection of the borderline between the sky and the surrounding buildings, which are captured in white, due to the difference in the atmospheric transmittance rate between visible light and IR rays. Positioning is performed only with visible satellites having fewer multipath errors and without using invisible satellites. With the proposed system, static and kinematic evaluations in which invisible satellites are discriminated through observation using an omnidirectional IR camera are conducted. Hence, signals are received even if satellites are hidden behind buildings; furthermore, the exclusion of satellites having large errors from the positioning computation becomes possible. The evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the feasibility of highly accurate positioning.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2008.2011688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4796392/04770186.pdf","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPS Multipath Mitigation for Urban Area Using Omnidirectional Infrared Camera","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2008.2011688","startPage":"22","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"GPS Multipath Mitigation for Urban Area Using Omnidirectional Infrared Camera","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770186/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10501765","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770186/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPS Multipath Mitigation for Urban Area Using Omnidirectional Infrared Camera","sourcePdf":"tits-meguro-2011688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081885S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4796392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4796392","articleId":"4770186","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4770193,"authors":[{"name":"Qiaoliang Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi Spectral Information Processing Technology, Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qiaoliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37596476400"},{"name":"Guoyou Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi Spectral Information Processing Technology, Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guoyou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37633273300"},{"name":"Jianguo Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi Spectral Information Processing Technology, Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Liu","id":"38189740500"},{"name":"Shaobo Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi Spectral Information Processing Technology, Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shaobo","lastName":"Chen","id":"38188970500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4770193","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":144,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2585},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Remote sensing","Image registration","Satellites","Feature extraction","Image sensors","Image analysis","Image fusion","Surveillance","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical techniques","image matching","image registration","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale-invariant feature transform","SIFT","remote sensing","image registration","scale-orientation joint restriction","multidate remote image","multispectral remote image","multisensor remote image","image fusion","image feature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature matching","image registration","scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)","scale\u2013orientation joint restriction criteria"]}],"abstract":"When the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is adopted in the registration of remote sensing images, a lot of incorrect matches of keypoints will appear owing to the significant difference in the image intensity between remote sensing images compared to visible images.

Experimental results for multidate, multispectral, and multisensor remote images indicate that the proposed method improves the match performance compared to intensity- and SIFT-based methods in terms of correct-match rate and aligning accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Remote Sensing Image Registration","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2011751","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4814847/04770193.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2011751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Remote Sensing Image Registration","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4770193/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572785","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Scale-Invariant Feature Matching for Remote Sensing Image Registration","sourcePdf":"lgrs-li-2011751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055853S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4814847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4814847","articleId":"4770193","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770199,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Baro","affiliation":["Computer Vision Center, Edificio, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4796392/4770199/4770199-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xavier Bar\u00f3 received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the detection and classification of traffic signs. Detection is based on a boosted detectors cascade, trained with a novel evolutionary version of Adaboost, which allows the use of large feature spaces. Classification is defined as a multiclass categorization problem. A battery of classifiers is trained to split classes in an Error-Correcting Output Code (ECOC) framework. We propose an ECOC design through a forest of optimal tree structures that are embedded in the ECOC matrix. The novel system offers high performance and better accuracy than the state-of-the-art strategies and is potentially better in terms of noise, affine deformation, partial occlusions, and reduced illumination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"10","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10501766","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4770199/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Sign Recognition Using Evolutionary Adaboost Detection and Forest-ECOC Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Sign Recognition Using Evolutionary Adaboost Detection and Forest-ECOC Classification","sourcePdf":"tits-baro-2011702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190018S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4796392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4796392","articleId":"4770199","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4770201,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Y.

The array is based on switchable microstrip slot antennas that are series fed in one dimension and parallel fed in the other dimension. In conjunction with spatial multiplexing of local elements (SMILE) techniques, the array is able to use both the series- and parallel-fed antennas for 2-D beamforming and DOA estimations. The combination of series and parallel feeding provides a simple way of constructing 2-D DBF arrays with a simple and uniplanar feed network. Other advantages are its low cost and compatibility with a microwave integrated circuit process for the receiver system. A 4 times 4 receiving array test bed at a 5.5-GHz operating frequency is fabricated, and DBF and DOA tests on this test bed are successfully demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10829123","htmlLink":"/document/4770203/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Planar Array for Digital Beamforming and Direction-of-Arrival Estimations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Planar Array for Digital Beamforming and Direction-of-Arrival Estimations","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2014386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067991S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4770203","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4770205,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua M.

Because these systems solely rely on the vision sensor's ability to detect the lane markings on the roadway, these systems are extremely sensitive to the roadway conditions. When a vehicle's LDW system fails to detect lane markers on the roadway, it loses its ability to alert the driver of an unintended lane departure. The goal of this research is to use GPS combined with inertial sensors and a high-accuracy map to assist a vision-based LDW system. GPS navigation systems are available in many automobiles, along with automotive-grade inertial sensors. The low accuracy of a typical GPS receiver found in an automotive navigation system is largely attributed to a position error. This error is too large to allow the GPS receiver to locate a vehicle in a particular lane on a roadway. A method to measure this error using a vision-based LDW system, together with a high-accuracy map, is presented in this paper. With the error known, the accuracy of the GPS receiver is increased to a high-enough level to localize the vehicle on a particular lane. Next, a method fusing GPS/inertial navigation sensor/vision and a high-accuracy map for highway lane tracking is presented. This method provides a backup lateral offset measurement that can be used for LDW when the LDW vision system loses track of the lane markings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770205/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10501767","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Cost Solution for an Integrated Multisensor Lane Departure Warning System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Cost Solution for an Integrated Multisensor Lane Departure Warning System","sourcePdf":"tits-clanton-2011690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055267S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4796392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4796392","articleId":"4770205","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4770210,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis Kwasinski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Kwasinski","id":"37280511700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"4770210","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":179,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3264},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit topology","Microwave integrated circuits","Switches","Leg","Load flow","Load flow analysis","Inductance","Power control","Coupling circuits","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input dc-dc converters","single-input dc-dc converter","forward-conducting bidirectional blocking switch","multiple-input converter synthesis","single-ended primary inductance converter","Cuk converters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter realization rules","feasible dc\u2013dc converter topologies","independent input power control","input cells","multiple-input converters"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies single-input dc-dc converter topologies that are suitable to be expanded into their multiple-input converter version. The analysis is based on several assumptions, restrictions, and conditions, including the goal of minimizing the total number of components and the use of at least one forward-conducting bidirectional blocking switch in each input leg. These conditions may affect the outcome of the multiple-input converter synthesis and lead to different configurations from those suggested before in the literature. Although simultaneous power delivery from all sources is not required, it should be possible to independently control the power drained from each input with some degree of freedom. The letter lists four rules that must be observed in order to be able to realize a multiple-input converter from its single-input version. These rules are used to identify the only feasible input cell that complies with all assumptions and conditions. Unfeasible input cells are also shown. The letter also identifies some additional feasible input cells if some of the assumptions and conditions are relaxed. These input cells are used to suggest several multiple-input converter topologies. Among them, six topologies, including versions of the single-ended primary inductance converter and the Cuk converters, are introduced through their circuit schematic.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of Feasible Topologies for Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009538","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04770210.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2009538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Feasible Topologies for Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4770210/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586838","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Feasible Topologies for Multiple-Input DC\u2013DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-kwasinski-2009538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064292S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4770210","onlineDate":"02 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4770214,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenxing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenxing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404934800"},{"name":"Yue-Kai Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","NEC Laboratories, America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yue-Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37278787600"},{"name":"Yanhua Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yanhua","lastName":"Deng","id":"37310699300"},{"name":"John Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406508000"},{"name":"Paul R.

However, it hasn't stopped fuel cell technology proving its worth in many other applications. Hydrogen fuel cells generate a current by passing hydrogen and oxygen over either side of a special membrane. This allows an exchange of protons through the membrane and causes electrons to flow around the circuit. Fuel cells and hydrogen energy offer an alternative source of power that is sustainable and reduces our dependence on oil and fossil fuel.

Results show that interfering ions influence the sensitivity graph of sensors detecting the main ion by shifting the gradient by 17%.

Analysis of variance test gives a small -value indicating noticeable mean value of voltage response relating to change of main ion activity despite a large error variance possibly from the interfering ionic activity purposely added to the solutions.

Since floating gate can result in state-holding, intermittent and pattern-dependent fault effects, these models are generally more complex. Consequently, logical testing is proven can not guarantee the detection of the defect. In this paper, analogue diagnosis to the defect based on defective current is proposed. The magnitude of abnormal increased of power supply current is mainly subjected to the specific location in the Circuit Under Test (CUT), magnitude of input voltage and its sequence. Current open defect diagnosis methods are either keep repeating the circuit simulation based on try and error technique which is tedious or consider part of the factors only for the defect. Thus, the diagnosis results from current procedures may not be as accurate as possible and fully covered. In the proposed method, the significant difference of defective current and the magnitude of voltage supply in sequence are considered using optimization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Results show that the proposed method can achieve a very high diagnosis accuracy and simulation time.","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2008.4770353","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760204/4770249/04770353.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"417","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2008.4770353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4770249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analogue diagnosis of CMOS floating gate defect (FGD) using Genetic Algorithms (GAs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analogue diagnosis of CMOS floating gate defect (FGD) using Genetic Algorithms (GAs)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10417035","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4770353/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analogue diagnosis of CMOS floating gate defect (FGD) using Genetic Algorithms (GAs)","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01272009-00104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035772S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760204","isNumber":"4770249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760204","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4770249","articleId":"4770353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4770357,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

The challenge of failure detection has attracted investigation on efficient testing and diagnosis algorithm for better fault coverage and diagnostic resolution. March algorithms are widely used in SRAM testing to detect and diagnose SRAM fault model since they are relatively simple and yet providing high fault coverage and diagnostic resolution. In this case to achieve high fault coverage the structure of the consecutive memory backgrounds are very important. This paper aims to prove the efficiency of March 12N algorithm in term of detection and identification capability and locate the NPSF model fault. The details of test and diagnosis procedures for NPSF are demonstrated in this paper. The fault detection and diagnostic of the SRAM memories in this paper is verified and proven. The required march elements, detection requirement, detection conditions and fault syndromes are also enlightened. Furthermore, these particulars are required to determine a good algorithm other applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770357/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10417037","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4770357/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"12N test procedure for NPSF testing and diagnosis for SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"12N test procedure for NPSF testing and diagnosis for SRAMs","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01272009-00108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036763S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760204","isNumber":"4770249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760204","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4770249","articleId":"4770357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":4770361,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Angelo Galvez Lorenzo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Philippines, Philippines"],"firstName":"Michael Angelo","lastName":"Galvez Lorenzo","id":"37947613000"},{"name":"Wilson Mazo Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Philippines, Philippines"],"firstName":"Wilson","lastName":"Mazo Tan","id":"37650791200"},{"name":"Anastacia Parado Ballesil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Philippines, Philippines"],"firstName":"Anastacia","lastName":"Parado Ballesil","id":"37294143600"},{"name":"Louis Poblete Alarcon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Poblete Alarcon","id":"37294326300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2561-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770361","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental analysis of read related transistors\u2019 gate width sizing effects on the 3T1D DRAM access time curve","abstract":"Unlike SRAMs, the access time of 3T1D DRAMs increase as the feature size becomes smaller. To combat this slow down, it has been suggested that the sizes of read related transistors be increased, a technique that has never been thoroughly explored. This paper deals with the exploration of the effects of the said technique, focusing on its effectiveness as a function of the width increase and how it holds up as feature sizes get smaller. Our results show that applying such technique sometimes has unexpected and surprising effects, including deviating the access time curve from its expected shape, and worse, even slowing the memory cell down even further at certain times-of-read. We also discovered that the effectiveness of the technique actually becomes more and more limited as feature sizes get smaller. At a smaller feature size, it would no longer be sufficient by itself, and would have to be combined with another technique to speed up the memory cell.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Diodes","Voltage","Capacitance","Predictive models","Transistors","Shape","DRAM chips","SRAM chips","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistors","gate width sizing","access time curve","3T1D DRAM","memory cell"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770361","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2008.4770361","startPage":"450","endPage":"454","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760204/4770249/04770361.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4770249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2008.4770361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770361/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental analysis of read related transistors\u2019 gate width sizing effects on the 3T1D DRAM access time curve","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10459120","htmlLink":"/document/4770361/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental analysis of read related transistors\u2019 gate width sizing effects on the 3T1D DRAM access time curve","confLoc":"Johor Bahru, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01272009-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054842S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760204","isNumber":"4770249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760204","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4770249","articleId":"4770361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4770397,"authors":[{"name":"Khairizam Abd Rani","affiliation":["Phase 2 Bayan Lepas FIZ, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Khairizam Abd","lastName":"Rani","id":"38192221100"},{"name":"Rameshwaren Arumugam","affiliation":["Phase 2 Bayan Lepas FIZ, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rameshwaren","lastName":"Arumugam","id":"38187020700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2561-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3873-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770397","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Bonding","Gold","Lead","Metallization","Copper","Production","Etching","Packaging machines","Polishing machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball grid arrays","bonding processes","grinding","specimen preparation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backside emission analysis","BGA sample preparation repackaging","selected area grinding","re-bonding","back grinding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770397","abstract":"Current method of BGA sample preparation repackaging process for backside emission analysis is by applying direct bonding from the exposed gold wire on the bottom of the package to the lead frame of the secondary open top package.

We model the desired best effort (BE) source rates as the solution to an alpha-fair utility maximization problem which is constrained with link capacities while preserving guaranteed service (GS) traffic requirements at the desired level. We propose an iterative algorithm as the solution to the aforementioned problem which has the benefit of low complexity and fast convergence. We also explore the stability and convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and prove that it is globally asymptotically stable. Such an algorithm may be implemented by a centralized controller with low computation and communication overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4770580/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416817","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the Stability of Best Effort Flow Control Mechanisms in On-Chip Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Stability of Best Effort Flow Control Mechanisms in On-Chip Architectures","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"MASCOT-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081401S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757683","isNumber":"4770548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757683","xplore-issue":"4770548","articleId":"4770580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4770660,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jian Wang","id":"37880504900"},{"name":"Honghua Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Honghua Wang","id":"37538486500"},{"name":"Tianhang Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Tianhang Lu","id":"37878005100"},{"name":"Dehong Teng","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Dehong Teng","id":"38187223700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3826-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-5062-9221-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770660","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Permanent magnet motors","Switches","Control systems","Support vector machines","Mathematical model","Hysteresis","Three-term control","Magnetic switching","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","machine control","neurocontrollers","permanent magnet motors","PI control","PWM invertors","switching convertors","synchronous motor drives","three-term control","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct torque control","permanent magnet synchronous motor","inconstant switch frequency","PMSM drive","DTC method","space vector pulse width modulation","adaptive PID","artificial neural network","MATLAB","PI controller","inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permanent magnet synchronous motor","direct torque control","torque ripple"]}],"abstract":"To solve the problems of torque ripple and inconstant switch frequency of inverter in the conventional direct torque control (DTC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive, a novel DTC method using space vector pulse width modulation (SVM) is proposed based on analysis of PMSM mathematical model.

FLC does not need exact system mathematical model and can handle intricate nonlinearity, but its implementation is more complicated than that of PI and SMC. Comparative study of PI, SMC and FLC are carried out from four aspects: dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy, parameter robustness, and complexity of implementation. The experimental results show that both SMC and FLC provide more excellent performance than conventional PI, while SMC is easier to implement than FLC.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753968/4770630/04770881.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4770630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of PI, sliding mode and fuzzy logic controller for rotor field oriented controlled induction motor drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4770881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4770881/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of PI, sliding mode and fuzzy logic controller for rotor field oriented controlled induction motor drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4770881/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of PI, sliding mode and fuzzy logic controller for rotor field oriented controlled induction motor drives","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057083S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753968","isNumber":"4770630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753968","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4770630","articleId":"4770881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CES","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4770911,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Su","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Su","id":"37595206000"},{"name":"Lixun Xia","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lixun","lastName":"Xia","id":"38188135000"},{"name":"Yao Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37597393900"},{"name":"Hengsi Qin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hengsi","lastName":"Qin","id":"38188432800"},{"name":"Hongjun Xie","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Xie","id":"38187587100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3826-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-5062-9221-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4770911","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix converters","Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation converters","Rectifiers","Bridge circuits","Leg","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","matrix convertors","power electronics","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA chip","field programmable gate array","carrier modulation","four-leg matrix converter","3D space vector modulation","carrier PWM","programmable state machine","power electronics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Four-leg matrix converter","Carrier PWM","Programmable state machine","RISC","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Four-leg matrix converter usually requires complicate three-dimensional space vector modulation.

Time-stepping finite element method (T-S FEM) is employed to calculate the loss density in iron-core of PMSM with considering the harmonics of the flux density, and the total iron loss can be obtained by the summation of the iron losses in all the elements. The spatial discretization density, which affects loss calculation because the losses in the iron-core distribute non-uniformity, is investigated in this paper. Moreover there is such high frequency harmonic field in the rotor core caused by slot harmonic, to avoid folding phenomenon take place in calculation, this paper also investigates the related problem of time discretization, thus to ensure the computing precision. By represent the flux density as a Fourier series and calculate the series components of eddy current loss caused by harmonic field, the main component of eddy current loss and its variation under different operation conditions are obtained, the result indicate that there is a significant influence of slot harmonic field to iron loss. Finally the predictions of iron loss are compared with measurements.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753968/4770630/04771317.pdf","startPage":"3237","endPage":"3240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4770630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the iron loss of line start permanent magnet synchronous motor using time-stepping finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771317/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the iron loss of line start permanent magnet synchronous motor using time-stepping finite element method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467645","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771317/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the iron loss of line start permanent magnet synchronous motor using time-stepping finite element method","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01232009-00687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055102S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753968","isNumber":"4770630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753968","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4770630","articleId":"4771317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CES","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4771327,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shanshan Wu","id":"37087189453"},{"name":"David Diaz Reigosa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"firstName":"David Diaz","lastName":"Reigosa","id":"37392696700"},{"name":"Yuichi Shibukawa","affiliation":["Nissan Motor Company Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuichi Shibukawa","id":"37087190911"},{"name":"Michael A.

Field intensified IPMSM (FIIPMSM) is designed by adding flux barriers in the rotor of an IPMSM. In comparison with IPMSMs, FIIPMSMs have the advantage of decoupling saturation-induced saliency, cross-coupling effects and also secondary saliencies, which reduce the estimation accuracy of self-sensing control for IPMSMs. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to design the FIIPMSM and assess the performance of machine for self-sensing. Self-sensing capabilities of IPMSMs and FIIPMSMs are presented and compared.

Especially, it deteriorates the low speed performances obviously and reduces the positioning precision. Based on the Fourier analysis of the detent force curve as a function of the motor position and initial phase angle of the harmonics of each pole, the detent force can be reduced by optimally choosing the width of the magnets and asymmetric PM arrangement. The detailed rules to arrange and resize the magnets appropriately are presented and investigated. It is shown that such technique can greatly reduce thrust ripple and increase efficiency of a permanent magnet linear brushless DC motor (PMLBDCM).

The Akaike\u2019s final predication error (AFPE) criterion is applied to select the optimum number of wavelets to be used in the WNN model. Direct torque and flux control (DTC) is the direct control of the torque and stator flux of a drive by inverter voltage space vector selection through a lookup table. The WNN can be trained well to identify DTC system. The WNN controller with the structure of NARMA is utilized as speed controller to control the torque of the induction motor.

Cache access latency constraints preclude L1 instruction caches large enough to capture the application, library, and OS instruction working sets of these workloads. To cope with capacity constraints, researchers have proposed instruction prefetchers that use branch predictors to explore future control flow. However, such prefetchers suffer from several fundamental flaws: their lookahead is limited by branch prediction bandwidth, their accuracy suffers from geometrically-compounding branch misprediction probability, and they are ignorant of the cache contents, frequently predicting blocks already present in L1. Hence, L1 instruction misses remain a bottleneck. We propose temporal instruction fetch streaming (TIFS)-a mechanism for prefetching temporally-correlated instruction streams from lower-level caches. Rather than explore a programpsilas control flow graph, TIFS predicts future instruction-cache misses directly, through recording and replaying recurring L1 instruction miss sequences. In this paper, we first present an information-theoretic offline trace analysis of instruction-miss repetition to show that 94% of L1 instruction misses occur in long, recurring sequences. Then, we describe a practical mechanism to record these recurring sequences in the L2 cache and leverage them for instruction-cache prefetching. Our TIFS design requires less than 5% storage overhead over the baseline L2 cache and improves performance by 11% on average and 24% at best in a suite of commercial server workloads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal instruction fetch streaming","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771774","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771774.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Delay","Libraries","Bandwidth","Accuracy","Flow graphs","Information analysis","Cache storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","program diagnostics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal instruction fetch streaming","cache access latency constraint","branch prediction bandwidth","branch misprediction probability","information-theoretic offline trace analysis","capacity constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["instruction streaming","fetch-directed","caching","prefetching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal instruction fetch streaming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771774/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10428949","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal instruction fetch streaming","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089353S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4771778,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Raghavan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"38187615000"},{"name":"Colin Blundell","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Blundell","id":"37281822600"},{"name":"Milo M.

This work introduces PATCH (Predictive/Adaptive Token Counting Hybrid), a coherence protocol that provides the scalability of directory protocols while opportunistically sending direct requests to reduce sharing latency. PATCH extends a standard directory protocol to track tokens and use token counting rules for enforcing coherence permissions. Token counting allows PATCH to support direct requests on an unordered interconnect, while a mechanism called token tenure uses local processor timeouts and the directorypsilas per-block point of ordering at the home node to guarantee forward progress without relying on broadcast. PATCH makes three main contributions. First, PATCH introduces token tenure, which provides broadcast-free forward progress for token counting protocols. Second, PATCH deprioritizes best-effort direct requests to match or exceed the performance of directory protocols without restricting scalability. Finally, PATCH provides greater scalability than directory protocols when using inexact encodings of sharers because only processors holding tokens need to acknowledge requests. Overall, PATCH is a ldquoone-size-fits-allrdquo coherence protocol that dynamically adapts to work well for small systems, large systems, and anywhere in between.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771778/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10428952","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771778/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Token tenure: PATCHing token counting using directory-based cache coherence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Token tenure: PATCHing token counting using directory-based cache coherence","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080972S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4771784,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph L.

Traditional software implementations of these systems have high instrumentation overhead and suffer from significant performance impacts. To mitigate these slowdowns, a few hardware-assisted techniques have been recently proposed. However, these solutions incur a large memory overhead and require hardware platform support in the form of tagged memory systems and extended bus designs. Due to these costs and limitations, the deployment of heavyweight security analysis solutions is, as of today, limited to the research lab. In this paper, we describe Testudo, a novel hardware approach to heavyweight security analysis that is based on statistical sampling of a programpsilas dataflow. Our dynamic distributed debugging reduces the memory overhead to a small storage space by selectively sampling only a few tagged variables to analyze during any particular execution of the program. Our system requires only small hardware modifications: it adds a small sample cache to the main processor and extends the pipeline registers to propagate analysis tags. To gain high analysis coverage, we rely on a population of users to run the program, sampling a different random set of variables during each new run. We show that we can achieve high coverage analysis at virtually no performance impact, even with a reasonably-sized population of users. In addition, our approach even scales to heavyweight debugging techniques by keeping per-user runtime overheads low despite performing traditionally costly analyses. Moreover, the low hardware cost of our implementation allows it to be easily distributed across large user populations, leading to a higher level of security analysis coverage than previously.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771784","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771784.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"128","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testudo: Heavyweight security analysis via statistical sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Testudo: Heavyweight security analysis via statistical sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4771784/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459104","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testudo: Heavyweight security analysis via statistical sampling","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074858S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4771785,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37692300300"},{"name":"Josep Torrellas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Torrellas","id":"37282327600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771785","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":165,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":770},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Multicore processing","Frequency","Delay","Threshold voltage","Computer science","Circuits","Timing","Costs","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","fault tolerance","logic design","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","nonlinear programming","scheduling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Facelift","multicore aging hiding","processor service life","timing guardband","processor design","aging-driven application scheduling","multicore aging slow down","voltage change","nonlinear optimization algorithm","critical path delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771785","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771785.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771785","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facelift: Hiding and slowing down aging in multicores","abstract":"Processors progressively age during their service life due to normal workload activity. Such aging results in gradually slower circuits. Anticipating this fact, designers add timing guardbands to processors, so that processors last for a number of years. As a result, aging has important design and cost implications. To address this problem, this paper shows how to hide the effects of aging and how to slow it down. Our framework is called Facelift. It hides aging through aging-driven application scheduling. It slows down aging by applying voltage changes at key times - it uses a non-linear optimization algorithm to carefully balance the impact of voltage changes on the aging rate and on the critical path delays. Moreover, Facelift can gainfully configure the chip for a short service life. Simulation results indicate that Facelift leads to more cost-effective multicores. We can take a multicore designed for a 7-year service life and, by hiding and slowing down aging, enable it to run, on average, at a 14-15% higher frequency during its whole service life. Alternatively, we can design the multicore for a 5 to 7-month service life and still use it for 7 years.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771785/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10416965","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4771785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Facelift: Hiding and slowing down aging in multicores","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facelift: Hiding and slowing down aging in multicores","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107369S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771787,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Woh","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Woh","id":"37398081900"},{"name":"Yuan Lin","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37292131300"},{"name":"Sangwon Seo","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sangwon","lastName":"Seo","id":"37397792300"},{"name":"Scott Mahlke","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Mahlke","id":"37265029800"},{"name":"Trevor Mudge","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Mudge","id":"37267150400"},{"name":"Chaitali Chakrabarti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Chaitali","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37271330900"},{"name":"Richard Bruce","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bruce","id":"37088673948"},{"name":"Danny Kershaw","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Kershaw","id":"37371690000"},{"name":"Alastair Reid","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Alastair","lastName":"Reid","id":"38185005800"},{"name":"Mladen Wilder","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Wilder","id":"37088672695"},{"name":"Krisztian Flautner","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Krisztian","lastName":"Flautner","id":"37267088200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771787","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":556},"abstract":"With the multitude of existing and upcoming wireless standards, it is becoming increasingly difficult for hardware-only baseband processing solutions to adapt to the rapidly changing wireless communication landscape. Software defined radio (SDR) promises to deliver a cost effective and flexible solution by implementing a wide variety of wireless protocols in software. In previous work, a fully programmable multicore architecture, SODA, was proposed that was able to meet the real-time requirements of 3G wireless protocols. SODA consists of one ARM control processor and four wide single instruction multiple data (SIMD) processing elements. Each processing element consists of a scalar and a wide 512-bit 32-lane SIMD datapath. A commercial prototype based on the SODA architecture, Ardbeg (named after a brand of Scotch whisky), has been developed. In this paper, we present the architectural evolution of going from a research design to a commercial prototype, including the goals, tradeoffs, and final design choices. Ardbegpsilas redesign process can be grouped into the following three major areas: optimizing the wide SIMD datapath, providing long instruction word (LIW) support for SIMD operations, and adding application-specific hardware accelerators. Because SODA was originally designed with 180 nm technology, the wide SIMD datapath is re-optimized in Ardbeg for 90 nm technology. This includes re-evaluating the most efficient SIMD width, designing a wider SIMD shuffle network, and implementing faster SIMD arithmetic units. Ardbeg also provides modest LIW support by allowing two SIMD operations to issue in the same cycle. This LIW execution supports SDR algorithmspsila most common parallel SIMD execution patterns with minimal hardware overhead. A viable commercial SDR solution must be competitive with existing ASIC solutions. Therefore, algorithm-specific hardware is added for performance bottleneck algorithms while still maintaining enough flexibility to support multiple wireless protocols. The combination of these architectural improvements allows Ardbeg to achieve 1.5-7x speedup over SODA across multiple wireless algorithms while consuming less power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Wireless application protocol","Hardware","Prototypes","Communication standards","Wireless communication","Software radio","Costs","Multicore processing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","microprocessor chips","protocols","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SODA","scotch","wireless baseband processor","wireless standards","hardware-only baseband processing","wireless communication","software defined radio","3G wireless protocols","programmable multicore architecture","ARM control processor","single instruction multiple data processing","Ardbeg","architectural evolution","long instruction word support","application-specific hardware accelerators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771787","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771787","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771787","startPage":"152","endPage":"163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From SODA to scotch: The evolution of a wireless baseband processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"From SODA to scotch: The evolution of a wireless baseband processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771787/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771787/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From SODA to scotch: The evolution of a wireless baseband processor","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070052S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771788,"authors":[{"name":"Aqeel Mahesri","affiliation":["Center for Reliable and High-Performance Computing, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Aqeel","lastName":"Mahesri","id":"37391996200"},{"name":"Daniel Johnson","affiliation":["Center for Reliable and High-Performance Computing, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37401602300"},{"name":"Neal Crago","affiliation":["Center for Reliable and High-Performance Computing, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Crago","id":"38478156600"},{"name":"Sanjay J.

We compile a benchmark suite, VIS- Bench, to serve as a proxy for this application class. We use VISBench to examine some important high level decisions for an accelerator architecture. We propose a highly parallel base architecture. We examine the need for synchronization and data communication. We also examine GPU-style SIMD execution and find that a MIMD architecture usually performs better. Given these high level choices, we use VISBench to explore the microarchitectural design space. We analyze area versus performance tradeoffs in designing individual cores and the memory hierarchy. We find that a design made of small, simple cores achieves much higher throughput than a general purpose uniprocessor. Further, we find that a limited amount of support for ILP within each core aids overall performance. We find that fine-grained multithreading improves performance, but only up to a point. We find that word-level (SSE-style) SIMD provides a poor performance to area ratio. Finally, we find that sufficient memory and cache bandwidth is essential to performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoffs in designing accelerator architectures for visual computing","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771788","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771788.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tradeoffs in designing accelerator architectures for visual computing","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771788/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428955","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoffs in designing accelerator architectures for visual computing","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081718S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4771789,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatraman Govindaraju","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatraman","lastName":"Govindaraju","id":"38063965500"},{"name":"Peter Djeu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Djeu","id":"37282578400"},{"name":"Karthikeyan Sankaralingam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Sankaralingam","id":"37398408100"},{"name":"Mary Vernon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA"],"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Vernon","id":"37282519200"},{"name":"William R.

The conventional Z-buffer algorithm driven GPU model does not provide sufficient support for this improvement. This paper targets the entire graphics system stack and demonstrates algorithms, a software architecture, and a hardware architecture for real-time rendering with a paradigm shift to ray-tracing. The three unique features of our system called Copernicus are support for dynamic scenes, high image quality, and execution on programmable multicore architectures. The focus of this paper is the synergy and interaction between applications, architecture, and evaluation. First, we describe the ray-tracing algorithms which are designed to use redundancy and partitioning to achieve locality. Second, we describe the architecture which uses ISA specialization, multi-threading to hide memory delays and supports only local coherence. Finally, we develop an analytical performance model for our 128-core system, using measurements from simulation and a scaled-down prototype system. More generally, this paper addresses an important issue of mechanisms and evaluation for challenging workloads for future processors.

Some controllers treat prefetch requests the same as demand requests, others always prioritize demand requests over prefetch requests. However, none of these rigid policies result in the best performance because they do not take into account the usefulness of prefetch requests. If prefetch requests are useless, treating prefetches and demands equally can lead to significant performance loss and extra bandwidth consumption. In contrast, if prefetch requests are useful, prioritizing demands over prefetches can hurt performance by reducing DRAM throughput and delaying the service of useful requests. This paper proposes a new low-cost memory controller, called Prefetch-Aware DRAM Controller (PADC), that aims to maximize the benefit of useful prefetches and minimize the harm caused by useless prefetches. To accomplish this, PADC estimates the usefulness of prefetch requests and dynamically adapts its scheduling and buffer management policies based on the estimates. The key idea is to 1) adaptively prioritize between demand and prefetch requests, and 2) drop useless prefetches to free up memory system resources, based on the accuracy of the prefetcher. Our evaluation shows that PADC significantly outperforms previous memory controllers with rigid prefetch handling policies on both single- and multi-core systems with a variety of prefetching algorithms. Across a wide range of multiprogrammed SPEC CPU 2000/2006 workloads, it improves system performance by 8.2%on a 4-core system and by 9.9%on an 8-core system while reducing DRAM bandwidth consumption by 10.7% and 9.4% respectively.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771791","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771791.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prefetch-Aware DRAM Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Prefetch-Aware DRAM Controllers","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771791/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prefetch-Aware DRAM Controllers","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098619S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771792,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Hongzhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37400956900"},{"name":"Jiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37421483200"},{"name":"Zhao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279632200"},{"name":"Eugene Gorbatov","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Gorbatov","id":"37845939900"},{"name":"Howard David","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"David","id":"37684577200"},{"name":"Zhichun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Zhichun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281370900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771792","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":1181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Memory architecture","Delay","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Multicore processing","Bridges","Frequency","Concurrent computing","SDRAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","logic design","low-power electronics","memory architecture","storage management chips","system buses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive DRAM architecture","memory power efficiency","multicore processor","memory bandwidth","memory power consumption","memory-intensive workload","bridge chip","DDRx bus protocol","DRAM dual in-line memory","performance-power trade-off"]}],"abstract":"The widespread use of multicore processors has dramatically increased the demand on high memory bandwidth and large memory capacity. As DRAM subsystem designs stretch to meet the demand, memory power consumption is now approaching that of processors. However, the conventional DRAM architecture prevents any meaningful power and performance trade-offs for memory-intensive workloads. We propose a novel idea called mini-rank for DDRx (DDR/DDR2/DDR3) DRAMs, which uses a small bridge chip on each DRAM DIMM to break a conventional DRAM rank into multiple smaller mini-ranks so as to reduce the number of devices involved in a single memory access. The design dramatically reduces the memory power consumption with only a slight increase on the memory idle latency. It does not change the DDRx bus protocol and its configuration can be adapted for the best performance-power trade-offs. Our experimental results using four-core multiprogramming workloads show that using x32 mini-ranks reduces memory power by 27.0% with 2.8% performance penalty and using x16 mini-ranks reduces memory power by 44.1% with 7.4% performance penalty on average for memory-intensive workloads, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771792","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771792.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mini-rank: Adaptive DRAM architecture for improving memory power efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mini-rank: Adaptive DRAM architecture for improving memory power efficiency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771792/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10416967","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771792/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mini-rank: Adaptive DRAM architecture for improving memory power efficiency","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078258S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771793,"authors":[{"name":"Haiming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37834643100"},{"name":"Michael Ferdman","affiliation":["Department of Elec. & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ferdman","id":"37395316000"},{"name":"Jaehyuk Huh","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Jaehyuk","lastName":"Huh","id":"37726539200"},{"name":"Doug Burger","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Burger","id":"37282750500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771793","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":880},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Accuracy","Microprocessors","History","System performance","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data cache burst","dead block elimination","cache efficiency","general-purpose microprocessor","dead-block prediction","LI cache"]}],"abstract":"Data caches in general-purpose microprocessors often contain mostly dead blocks and are thus used inefficiently. To improve cache efficiency, dead blocks should be identified and evicted early. Prior schemes predict the death of a block immediately after it is accessed; however, these schemes yield lower prediction accuracy and coverage. Instead, we find that predicting the death of a block when it just moves out of the MRU position gives the best tradeoff between timeliness and prediction accuracy/coverage. Furthermore, the individual reference history of a block in the L1 cache can be irregular because of data/control dependence. This paper proposes a new class of dead-block predictors that predict dead blocks based on bursts of accesses to a cache block. A cache burst begins when a block becomes MRU and ends when it becomes non-MRU. Cache bursts are more predictable than individual references because they hide the irregularity of individual references. When used at the L1 cache, the best burst-based predictor can identify 96% of the dead blocks with a 96% accuracy. With the improved dead-block predictors, we evaluate three ways to increase cache efficiency by eliminating dead blocks early: replacement optimization, bypassing, and prefetching. The most effective approach, prefetching into dead blocks, increases the average L1 efficiency from 8% to 17% and the L2 efficiency from 17% to 27%. This increased cache efficiency translates into higher overall performance: prefetching into dead blocks outperforms the same prefetch scheme without dead-block prediction by 12% at the L1 and by 13% at the L2.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache bursts: A new approach for eliminating dead blocks and increasing cache efficiency","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771793","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771793.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cache bursts: A new approach for eliminating dead blocks and increasing cache efficiency","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771793/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416968","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache bursts: A new approach for eliminating dead blocks and increasing cache efficiency","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097521S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4771797,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin C.

Multiprocessor simulators, however, must account for synchronization events that increase the cost of every cycle simulated and shared resource contention that increases the total number of cycles simulated. These effects cause multiprocessor simulation times to scale superlinearly with the number of cores. Composable performance regression (CPR) fundamentally addresses these intractable multiprocessor simulation times, estimating multiprocessor performance with a combination of uniprocessor, contention, and penalty models. The uniprocessor model predicts baseline performance of each core while the contention models predict interfering accesses from other cores. Uniprocessor and contention model outputs are composed by a penalty model to produce the final multiprocessor performance estimate. Trained with a production quality simulator, CPR is accurate with median errors of 6.63, 4.83 percent for dual-, quad-core multiprocessors. Furthermore, composable regression is scalable, requiring 0.33x the simulations required by prior regression strategies.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771797","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771797.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CPR: Composable performance regression for scalable multiprocessor models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771797/","displayDocTitle":"CPR: Composable performance regression for scalable multiprocessor models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416970","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771797/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CPR: Composable performance regression for scalable multiprocessor models","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073308S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4771798,"authors":[{"name":"Kypros Constantinides","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Lab, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Kypros","lastName":"Constantinides","id":"37298045400"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research and Carnegie, Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"},{"name":"Todd Austin","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Lab, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Austin","id":"37267010600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771798","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771798","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer bugs","Signal design","Monitoring","Signal analysis","Signal processing","Process design","Customer satisfaction","Sun","Flip-flops","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-chip devices","formal verification","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit testing","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RTL analysis","resource integration","modern multiprocessors","verification process","low-overhead mechanism","Sun's OpenSPARC Tl","processor errata sheets","distributed online design bug detection mechanism","flip-flops"]}],"abstract":"Higher level of resource integration and the addition of new features in modern multi-processors put a significant pressure on their verification. Although a large amount of resources and time are devoted to the verification phase of modern processors, many design bugs escape the verification process and slip into processors operating in the field. These design bugs often lead to lower quality products, lower customer satisfaction, diminishing brand/company reputation, or even expensive product recalls. This paper proposes a flexible, low-overhead mechanism to detect the occurrence of design bugs during on-line operation. First, we analyze the actual design bugs found and fixed in a commercial chip- multiprocessor, Sun's OpenSPARC Tl, to understand the behavior and characteristics of design bugs. Our RTL analysis of design bugs shows that the number of signals that need to be monitored to detect design bugs is significantly larger than suggested by previous studies that analyzed design bugs at a higher level using processor errata sheets. Second, based on the insights obtained from our analyses, we propose a programmable, distributed online design bug detection mechanism that incorporates the monitoring of bugs into the flip-flops of the design. The key contribution of our mechanism is its ability to monitor all control signals in the design rather than a set of signals selected at design time. As a result, it is very flexible: when a bug is discovered after the processor is shipped, it can be detected by monitoring the set of control signals that trigger the design bug. We develop an RTL prototype implementation of our mechanism on the OpenSPARC Tl chip multiprocessor. We found its area overhead to be 10% and its power consumption overhead to be 3.5% over the whole OpenSPARC Tl chip.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771798","startPage":"282","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771798","endPage":"293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online design bug detection: RTL analysis, flexible mechanisms, and evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Online design bug detection: RTL analysis, flexible mechanisms, and evaluation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771798/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10428958","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online design bug detection: RTL analysis, flexible mechanisms, and evaluation","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065013S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4771801,"authors":[{"name":"Ramazan Bitirgen","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ramazan","lastName":"Bitirgen","id":"38190986900"},{"name":"Engin Ipek","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Engin","lastName":"Ipek","id":"38053361000"},{"name":"Jose F.

Although several proposals that address the management of a single microarchitectural resource have been published in the literature, coordinated management of multiple interacting resources on CMPs remains an open problem. We propose a framework that manages multiple shared CMP resources in a coordinated fashion to enforce higher-level performance objectives. We formulate global resource allocation as a machine learning problem. At runtime, our resource management scheme monitors the execution of each application, and learns a predictive model of system performance as a function of allocation decisions. By learning each application's performance response to different resource distributions, our approach makes it possible to anticipate the system-level performance impact of allocation decisions at runtime with little runtime overhead. As a result, it becomes possible to make reliable comparisons among different points in a vast and dynamically changing allocation space, allowing us to adapt our allocation decisions as applications undergo phase changes. Our evaluation concludes that a coordinated approach to managing multiple interacting resources is key to delivering high performance in multiprogrammed workloads, but this is possible only if accompanied by efficient search mechanisms. We also show that it is possible to build a single mechanism that consistently delivers high performance under various important performance metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771801.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated management of multiple interacting resources in chip multiprocessors: A machine learning approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Machine learning","Bandwidth","Proposals","Microarchitecture","Runtime","Quality of service","High performance computing","Laboratories","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated management","multiple interacting resources","chip multiprocessors","machine learning","system-level performance objectives","microarchitectural resource","open problem","global resource allocation","resource management scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated management of multiple interacting resources in chip multiprocessors: A machine learning approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459108","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated management of multiple interacting resources in chip multiprocessors: A machine learning approach","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07593S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4771803,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37279683000"},{"name":"Li-Shiuan Peh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Li-Shiuan","lastName":"Peh","id":"37274794400"},{"name":"Niraj K.

Fortunately, promising gains can be realized via integration of radio frequency interconnect (RF-I) through on-chip transmission lines with traditional interconnects implemented with RC wires. While prior work has considered the latency advantage of RF-I, we demonstrate three further advantages of RF-I: (1) RF-I bandwidth can be flexibly allocated to provide an adaptive NoC, (2) RF-I can enable a dramatic power and area reduction by simplification of NoC topology, and (3) RF-I provides natural and efficient support for multicast. In this paper, we propose a novel interconnect design, exploiting dynamic RF-I bandwidth allocation to realize a reconfigurable network-on-chip architecture. We find that our adaptive RF-I architecture on top of a mesh with 4B links can even outperform the baseline with 16B mesh links by about 1%, and reduces NoC power by approximately 65% including the overhead incurred for supporting RF-I.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771806","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771806.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","startPage":"376","endPage":"387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power reduction of CMP communication networks via RF-interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power reduction of CMP communication networks via RF-interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771806/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10416974","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4771806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power reduction of CMP communication networks via RF-interconnects","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074601S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4771808,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Xin Fu","id":"37532127600"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Li","id":"37539272900"},{"name":"Jose Fortes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Fortes","id":"37283877900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2836-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2837-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4771808","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Microarchitecture","CMOS technology","Circuits","Frequency","Degradation","Microprocessors","Temperature","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","micromechanical devices","MOSFET","nanofabrication","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microarchitecture","process variation","negative bias temperature instability","PMOS transistors","reliability","submicrometer CMOS","parametric variation","nanoscale device fabrication"]}],"abstract":"Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), which reduces the lifetime of PMOS transistors, is becoming a growing reliability concern for sub-micrometer CMOS technologies.

If, to prevent any resulting timing errors, we design processors for worst-case parameter values, we may lose substantial performance. An alternate approach explored in this paper is to design for closer to nominal values, and provide some transistor budget to tolerate unavoidable variation-induced errors. To assess this approach, this paper first presents a novel framework that shows how microarchitecture techniques can trade off variation-induced errors for power and processor frequency. Then, the paper introduces an effective technique to maximize performance and minimize power in the presence of variation-induced errors, namely High-Dimensional dynamic adaptation. For efficiency, the technique is implemented using a machine-learning algorithm. The results show that our best configuration increases processor frequency by 56% on average, allowing the processor to cycle 21% faster than without variation.

Emerging 3D chip integration techniques leverage vertically stacked structures to reduce on-chip wire delay and have shown the capability of overcoming interconnect bottlenecks as well as reducing power consumption. While the benefits of 3D die stacking on microprocessor performance and power have been extensively investigated recently, its implication on transient fault susceptibility is largely unknown. In this work, we make the first attempt to characterize microarchitecture soft error vulnerabilities across the stacked chip layers under 3D integration technologies. Using models and simulations that capture soft error physical mechanism and circuit/architecture level impact, our study reveals the opportunities of leveraging 3D integration (e.g. the structure of vertical stacking and the incorporation of heterogeneous process technologies) to achieve enhanced reliability. We showcase that the first characteristic allows outer-layers to shield inter-layers from particle strikes and the second feature enables the deployment of error resilience device techniques (e.g. Silicon-On-Insulator) on vulnerable layers to achieve a reliability target while minimizing manufacturing cost. We further propose a set of microarchitecture techniques which can effectively exploit the reliability benefits offered by 3D technologies. For example, we propose the scheduling of vulnerable in-flight instructions to reliable layers and design robust register files by combing reliability-hardened circuits, program value vulnerability and 3D integration techniques. Experimental results show that these techniques are able to substantially reduce 3D microarchitecturespsila soft error rate by up to 88% compared to a planar design. We further evaluate the thermal implication of the proposed techniques and conclude that their impact on chip temperature is negligible.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771811","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771811.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microarchitecture soft error vulnerability characterization and mitigation under 3D integration technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microarchitecture soft error vulnerability characterization and mitigation under 3D integration technology","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10459109","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771811/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microarchitecture soft error vulnerability characterization and mitigation under 3D integration technology","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12871S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771813,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald G.

Supply voltage scaling techniques can provide an order of magnitude reduction in energy. Current commercial memory technologies have been limited in the degree of supply voltage scaling that can be performed if they are to meet yield and reliability constraints. This has limited designers from exploring the near threshold operating regions for embedded processors. Summarizing prior work we show how proper sizing of memory cells can guarantee that the memory cell reliability in the near threshold supply voltage region matches that of a standard memory cell. However, this robustness comes with a significant area cost. We show how to employ these cells to build cache architectures that greatly reduce energy consumption. We propose an embedded processor based on these new cache architectures that operates in a low power mode, with minimal impact on full performance runtime. The proposed cache uses near threshold tolerant cache ways to reduce access energy combined with traditional cache ways to maintain performance. The access policy of the cache ways is then dynamically reconfigured to obtain energy efficient performance while minimally impacting the high performance mode runtime. Using near threshold cache architectures we show an energy reduction of 53% over a traditional filter cache. For the MIBench embedded benchmarks we show on average an 86% (7.3times) reduction in energy while in low power (10 MHz) mode with only an average 2% increase in runtime in high performance (400 MHz) mode. And for SpecInt applications we show a 77% (4.4times) reduction in energy in low power mode with only an average 4.8% increase in runtime for high performance mode. In addition we show that these trends hold from 130 nm to 45 nm technology nodes.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771813","publicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 41st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757685/4771764/04771813.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2008.4771813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable energy efficient near threshold cache architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable energy efficient near threshold cache architectures","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10416978","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4771813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable energy efficient near threshold cache architectures","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01262009-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075147S","chronDate":"8-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757685","isNumber":"4771764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757685","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4771764","articleId":"4771813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4771870,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhu","affiliation":["Sch. of Environ.

Aimed at the shortcoming of the BP neural network, such as the slow training speed, easy to be trapped into the local optimums, and the premature convergence of genetic algorithm (GA) BP neural network, a method to design the BP neural network based on Immune genetic algorithm was proposed. The mechanisms of diversity maintaining and antibody density regulation exhibited in a biological immune system were introduced into IGA based on genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm overcame the problems of GA on search efficiency, individual diversity and premature, and enhanced the convergent performance effectively. The results show that the IGA-BP neural network have better performance in convergent speed and global convergence, and the forecasting accuracy is improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771870/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10468240","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771870/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research of Coal and Gas Outburst Forecasting Based on Immune Genetic Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research of Coal and Gas Outburst Forecasting Based on Immune Genetic Neural Network","confLoc":"Moscow, Russia","sourcePdf":"3543a028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056935S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4771854","isNumber":"4771855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4771854","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4771855","articleId":"4771870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4771871,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Ji","affiliation":["Department of Library, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37404381100"},{"name":"Yajing Li","affiliation":["Foreign Language Department, North China Coal Medical University, Tangshan, China"],"firstName":"Yajing","lastName":"Li","id":"38190034400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3543-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4771871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Costs","Artificial neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Predictive models","Multi-layer neural network","Economic forecasting","Electronic mail","Decision making","Regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","construction","costing","decision making","project management","radial basis function networks","regression analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["construction cost forecasting","time series","regression analysis","nonlinear model","radial basis function neural network","immune algorithm","supervisory algorithm","network optimization","intellectualized management","construction project","construction management","decision making"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF","BP","neural network","construction cost","forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4771871","abstract":"In construction cost forecasting system, a great many uncertain factors effect the cost decision-making, so it is difficult to do effective forecasting by using traditional methods such as time series approach, regression analysis.

This task becomes increasingly important in such fields as gene function prediction or web-mining. Early approaches to MC were based on learning independent binary classifiers for each class and combining their outputs in order to obtain multi-label predictions. Alternatively, a classifier can be directly trained to predict a label set of an unknown size for each unseen instance. Recently, several direct multi-label learning algorithms have been proposed. This paper investigates a novel method to solve a MC task by using an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network. A modified Fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm Multi-Label-FAM (ML-FAM) was applied to classification of multi-label data. The obtained preliminary results on the Yeast data set and their comparison with the results of existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/WKDD.2009.200","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WKDD.2009.200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771855","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/4771854/4771855/04771899.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-label Classification with ART Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4771899/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-label Classification with ART Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4771899/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10468267","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-label Classification with ART Neural Networks","confLoc":"Moscow, Russia","sourcePdf":"3543a144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085275S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4771854","isNumber":"4771855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4771854","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4771855","articleId":"4771899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4771945,"authors":[{"name":"HongLi Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information and Electronic Engineering, ZheJiang University City College, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"HongLi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37307691200"},{"name":"GuangChun Gao","affiliation":["College of Information and Electronic Engineering, ZheJiang University City College, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"GuangChun","lastName":"Gao","id":"38023393300"},{"name":"Gang Bi","affiliation":["College of Information and Electronic Engineering, ZheJiang University City College, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Bi","id":"38190383800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3543-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4771945","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"abstract":"In this paper, a new kind of COFDM demodulator is proposed, which is conforming to the European DVB-T standard.

The measured pulsed bias X-parameters are then used with the PHD framework to enable accurate nonlinear simulation of device behavior, including harmonics (magnitude and phase) under pulsed bias large-signal conditions with mismatch. Independent NVNA measurements validate the predictions of the X-parameter simulations of output match under drive, and show the inadequacy of \"Hot S22\" techniques to predict such device performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["GSM","Telephone sets","Pulse measurements","Pulse amplifiers","Distortion measurement","Scattering parameters","Drives","Time measurement","Phase measurement","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave integrated circuits","mobile handsets","multichip modules","nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-parameter measurement","GSM handset amplifier","poly-harmonic distortion nonlinear behavioral model","S-parameters","nonlinear vector network analyzer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2008.4772247","publicationTitle":"2008 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757684/4772181/04772247.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2008.4772247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-Parameter Measurement and Simulation of a GSM Handset Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"X-Parameter Measurement and Simulation of a GSM Handset Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772247/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772247/","accessionNumber":"10416859","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-Parameter Measurement and Simulation of a GSM Handset Amplifier","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EMICC-00-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040595S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757684","isNumber":"4772181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757684","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4772181","articleId":"4772247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Assoc.IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4772248,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

Thank to the asset of Above-IC, this DA performs a ratio of the GBW and power consumption of 4.31 GHz/mW, which is by far the best reported tradeoff among similar architecture in CMOS, at least 2.8 times higher than others.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers","CMOS technology","Energy consumption","Gain","Millimeter wave technology","Copper","Substrates","Passivation","Packaging","Bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave amplifiers","MIMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LNA","low-power distributed amplifier","above-IC","CMOS technology","post-processed technology","bonding pads redistribution","ultralow-loss on-chip","WPAN bandwidth","dc power consumption","gain-bandwidth product","frequency 92 GHz","frequency 57 GHz to 64 GHz","gain 13.4 dB","noise figure 5.6 dB to 6.7 dB","gain 1.7 dB","bandwidth 11 MHz","gain 6.5 dB","bandwidth 195 GHz","power 43 mW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2008.4772276","publicationTitle":"2008 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 European Microwave Integrated Circuit Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757684/4772181/04772276.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2008.4772276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-GHz LNA and a 92-GHz Low-Power Distributed Amplifier in CMOS with Above-IC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60-GHz LNA and a 92-GHz Low-Power Distributed Amplifier in CMOS with Above-IC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772276/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772276/","accessionNumber":"10416884","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-GHz LNA and a 92-GHz Low-Power Distributed Amplifier in CMOS with Above-IC","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"EMICC-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061297S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757684","isNumber":"4772181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757684","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4772181","articleId":"4772276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Assoc.IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4772277,"authors":[{"name":"Mattias Ferndahl","affiliation":["Department of Micro Technology and Nano Science, Microwave Electr.

Firstly, the numerical formulations are modified with the artificial anisotropy, and the numerical dispersion relation is derived. Secondly, the relative permittivity tensor of the artificial anisotropy can be obtained by the micro-genetic algorithm (MGA), which is a genetic algorithm with a very small population. Then, the capabilities and potentialities of this new method are demonstrated numerically using two non-uniform-mesh examples.

The challenge is then to provide a high-performance reliable data link that can operate with the restricted receiver power levels, severe channel fading due to multipath reflections and interfering energy from other devices nearby. With OFDM, it is possible to use a differential coding/differential detection either in the time or frequency domain depending on the condition of transmission channels with the adoption of DQPSK as a method of subcarrier modulation. This paper proposes an approximate derivation method of the bit error rate (BER) in DQPSK/OFDM system over frequency non-selective Nakagmai-Rice and Rayleigh fading channels. The validity of this equation is confirmed from the fact that the BER derived from this approximate equation coincides with that from the computer simulation, even when the system parameters, for example Doppler frequency, Rician parameter and so on, are varied. This paper will also review where OFDM is applicable and future applications.","doi":"10.1109/CJMW.2008.4772401","publicationTitle":"2008 China-Japan Joint Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 China-Japan Joint Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757053/4772357/04772401.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJMW.2008.4772401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772401/","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10458938","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772401/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CJMW-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03127S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757053","isNumber":"4772357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757053","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4772357","articleId":"4772401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Shanghai Univ.","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4772403,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Zhongpeng","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zhongpeng","id":"37298394300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3821-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"}],"articleNumber":"4772403","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"abstract":"Owing to the error propagation, the performance of VBLAST is constrained by the accuracy of the symbols recovered in the previous layer when the traditional detection successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm is applied.

To verify the analytical expression of BER, the BER performance is evaluated using Matlab simulation with 63 chipsper bit m-sequence as well as Gold sequence and compared with analytical results. It is investigated that simulation and analytical results are similar in all cases. Further, BER performance is evaluated for 1023 chips per bit encoding using analytical expression. The BER performance is found to be degraded due to FWM effect if the transmitted power per channel and number of simultaneous users are increased. It is investigated that maximum allowable transmitted power per channel is limited due to FWM effect. It is found that the maximum allowable transmitted power per channel is limited to 15 dB for 10 users and 20 dB for 20 users for a 10 Mb/s, 1000 km system with 1023 chips per bit encoding at a BER of 10-9.","doi":"10.1109/CJMW.2008.4772503","publicationTitle":"2008 China-Japan Joint Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 China-Japan Joint Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757053/4772357/04772503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJMW.2008.4772503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772357","startPage":"599","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the FWM of optical CDMA Transmission System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on the FWM of optical CDMA Transmission System","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772503/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428907","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4772503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the FWM of optical CDMA Transmission System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"CJMW-00-146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07768S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757053","isNumber":"4772357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757053","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4772357","articleId":"4772503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Shanghai Univ.IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4772510,"authors":[{"name":"ChiaSong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Vanung University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"ChiaSong","lastName":"Wu","id":"38063888100"},{"name":"ChienHuang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Vanung University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"ChienHuang","lastName":"Chang","id":"38064220200"},{"name":"HsingChung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Vanung University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"HsingChung","lastName":"Liu","id":"38189745800"},{"name":"TingYu Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Vanung University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"TingYu","lastName":"Ko","id":"38186615800"},{"name":"HsienChin Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chang Gung University, Linkou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"HsienChin","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37335452400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3821-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"}],"articleNumber":"4772510","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","High power amplifiers","MMICs","Power amplifiers","Integrated circuit technology","Coplanar waveguides","Microwave amplifiers","Monolithic integrated circuits","Indium gallium arsenide","PHEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","coplanar waveguides","gallium arsenide","HEMT integrated circuits","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","integrated circuit design","MMIC power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier MMIC","linearizer circuit","microwave monolithic integrated circuit","D-mode pHEMT technology","coplanar waveguide","input third-order intercept point","output third-order intercept point","power added efficiency","RF characteristics","frequency 5.2 GHz","size 0.15 mum","AlGaAs-InGaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","linearizer","MMIC","CPW"]}],"abstract":"This paper aimed to study the linearity in the 5.2 GHz power amplifier microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC), which was performed with a 0.15 mum AlGaAs/InGaAs D-mode pHEMT technology.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for high data rate wireless communications at reasonable complexity in wireless channels. OFDM has been adopted for many types of wireless systems like wireless local area networks such as IEEE 802.11a, and digital audio/video broadcasting (DAB/DVB). The proposed research focuses on a concatenated coding scheme that improve the performance of OFDM based wireless communications. It uses a redundant residue number system (RRNS) code as the outer code and a convolutional code as the inner code. The bit error rate (BER) performances of the proposed system under different channel conditions are investigated. These include the effect of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), multipath delay spread, peak power clipping and frame start synchronization error. The simulation results show that the proposed RRNS-convolutional concatenated coding (RCCC) scheme provides significant improvement in the system performance by exploiting the inherent properties of RRNS.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2008.4772571","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760205/4772559/04772571.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2008.4772571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRNS-Convolutional encoded concatenated code for OFDM based wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772571/","displayDocTitle":"RRNS-Convolutional encoded concatenated code for OFDM based wireless communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459145","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772571/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRNS-Convolutional encoded concatenated code for OFDM based wireless communication","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064164S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760205","isNumber":"4772559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760205","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4772559","articleId":"4772571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4772572,"authors":[{"name":"Tanmay De","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Tanmay","lastName":"De","id":"37717327200"},{"name":"Puneet Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Puneet","lastName":"Jain","id":"38187611300"},{"name":"Ajit Pal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Ajit","lastName":"Pal","id":"37286349300"},{"name":"Indranil Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Indranil","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37269313300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3805-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5798"}],"articleNumber":"4772572","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Telecommunication traffic","Wavelength routing","Wavelength assignment","Optical fiber networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Mesh networks","Traffic control","High speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","optical fibre networks","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","wavelength assignment","optical WDM mesh networks","wavelength routed optical networks","optical link","low-speed traffic streams","high-speed lightpath","wavelength routed mesh networks","multi-hop static traffic grooming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WDM","lightpath","GRWA","genetic approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772572","abstract":"In wavelength routed optical networks, each optical link is capable of carrying traffic using several wavelengths and each wavelength as well as lightpath support traffic in the Gbps range.

Therefore, to utilize the network resources (bandwidth, transceivers, etc.) effectively, several low-speed traffic streams have to be efficiently groomed or multiplexed into a high-speed lightpath. In this work, we have investigated the traffic grooming problem with the objective of maximizing the network throughput for wavelength routed mesh networks. We have proposed an algorithm to handle general multi-hop static traffic grooming based on genetic algorithm.

In this paper, an analytical model is developed and analyzed for the concerned target cell in CDMA cellular network. The model proposed in this paper is for integrated data and voice services. It is based on reservation for handoff voice and data calls along with call queuing scheme for handoff data calls. Preemptive priority scheme is used for handoff voice calls over ongoing data calls. Upper channel limits are set for new voice as well as data calls to give priority to handoff calls. Two dimensional Markov birth-death process is used for modeling the problem. The data handoff queue capacity is considered as function of soft handoff coverage area which depends on the two soft handoff threshold parameters T_ADD and T_DROP. Variation in these threshold parameters is stated in term of variation in handoff data call queue capacity. The performance parameters of the model mainly new voice and data call blocking probabilities and handoff voice and data dropping probabilities are analyzed for variation in upper channel limit for new voice call and handoff data call queue capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2008.4772574","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760205/4772559/04772574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2008.4772574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772559","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of voice/data call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of voice/data call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772574/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444655","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4772574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of voice/data call admission control scheme in CDMA cellular network for variation in soft handoff threshold parameters","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048405S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760205","isNumber":"4772559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760205","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4772559","articleId":"4772574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4772590,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Iqbal Bin Shahid","affiliation":["Gippsland School of IT, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Iqbal","lastName":"Bin Shahid","id":"37538174300"},{"name":"Joarder Kamruzzaman","affiliation":["Gippsland School of IT, Monash University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Joarder","lastName":"Kamruzzaman","id":"37280440800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3805-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-2216"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5798"}],"articleNumber":"4772590","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Radio transmitters","Fading","Shadow mapping","Detectors","White spaces","Radio frequency","Licenses","Uncertainty","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative systems","radiofrequency spectra","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","weighted soft decision","cooperative sensing","RF spectrum","noise uncertainty"]}],"abstract":"Enhancing the current services or deploying new services operating in RF spectrum requires more licensed spectrum which may not be provided by the regulatory bodies because of spectrum scarcity. On the contrary, recent studies suggest that many portions of the licensed spectrum remains unused or underused for significant period of time raising the issue of spectrum access without license in an opportunistic manner. Among all the spectrum accessing techniques, sensing based methods are considered optimal for their simplicity and cost effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a new cooperative spectrum sensing technique which considers the spatial variation of secondary (unlicensed) users and each userpsilas contribution is weighted by a factor that depends on received power and path loss. Compared to existing techniques, the proposed one increases the sensing ability and spectrum utilization, and offers greater robustness to noise uncertainty. Moreover, this cooperative technique uses very simple energy detector as its building block thereby reduces the cost and operational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2008.4772590","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760205/4772559/04772590.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2008.4772590","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted soft decision for cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Weighted soft decision for cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772590/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459153","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted soft decision for cooperative sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105797S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760205","isNumber":"4772559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760205","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4772559","articleId":"4772590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4772593,"authors":[{"name":"M.

So from security perspective, to identify the attack in its initial stage and to minimize the impact of attack, it is important to detect scanning activities in a network. We have mainly considered TCP flow because most of the Internet application uses it as a transport protocol. Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host. The proposed method provides a generic solution to SYN scan (half open), connect scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan and null scan. Results obtained from our method prove the detection capabilities and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2008.4772645","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760205/4772559/04772645.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2008.4772645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772559","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of TCP flow data for traffic anomaly and scan detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of TCP flow data for traffic anomaly and scan detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444703","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4772645/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of TCP flow data for traffic anomaly and scan detection","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046607S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760205","isNumber":"4772559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760205","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4772559","articleId":"4772645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4772650,"authors":[{"name":"G.

ICA based technique is based on independence of source signals and these conditions are satisfied in multi-user CDMA environment. Combining an ICA element to conventional signal detection reduces multiple access interference (MAI) and enables a robust, computationally efficient structure. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of differential entropy estimation, spacing estimation and converges quickly. Rayleigh fading channel has been considered for simulations. Bit error rate simulations of this algorithm has been given for different number of users, SNR and compared with JADE algorithm. The results show that RADICAL algorithm performs best at separating the source signals from the mixed CDMA signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2008.4772650","publicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760205/4772559/04772650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICON.2008.4772650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772559","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICA based multiuser detection of DS-CDMA using differential entropy estimation in Rayleigh fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ICA based multiuser detection of DS-CDMA using differential entropy estimation in Rayleigh fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772650/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444707","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4772650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICA based multiuser detection of DS-CDMA using differential entropy estimation in Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045146S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760205","isNumber":"4772559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760205","xplore-issue":"4772559","articleId":"4772650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4772698,"authors":[{"name":"Lokesh Kumar Bansal","firstName":"Lokesh Kumar","lastName":"Bansal","id":"38187051500"},{"name":"Aditya Trivedi","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, ABV Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37544703600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3327-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4772698","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Diversity reception","Fading","Convolutional codes","Bit error rate","Error analysis","AWGN","Multiaccess communication","Viterbi algorithm","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","space-time codes","trellis codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time trellis codes","multicarrier code division multiple access","multipath fading channel","bit error rate","minimum mean-square error detector","maximum-ratio combining","equal-gain combining","Viterbi decoder"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a space-time trellis-coded (STTC) multi-carrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) system for different states in multi-path fading channel is proposed, and the performance of the system is evaluated using simulation.

We propose using a non dominated sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) - a multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm. Instead of combining many conflicting objectives into a single function, the NSGA-II uses multiple objective optimizations and brings out solutions which provide a better trade-off taking all conditions into consideration. The simulation results and their marked improvement over previous algorithms provide the basis to this.","doi":"10.1109/WCSN.2008.4772703","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4758659/4772668/04772703.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSN.2008.4772703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate adaptive resource allocation for multiuser OFDM using NSGA - II","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772703/","displayDocTitle":"Rate adaptive resource allocation for multiuser OFDM using NSGA - II","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459337","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772703/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate adaptive resource allocation for multiuser OFDM using NSGA - II","confLoc":"Indore, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063516S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4758659","isNumber":"4772668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4758659","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4772668","articleId":"4772703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4772704,"authors":[{"name":"Isaque Suzuki","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Isaque","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"38013083000"},{"name":"Fernando Ciriaco","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Ciriaco","id":"37299832100"},{"name":"Taufik Abrao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, State University of Londrina, DEEL-UEL, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Taufik","lastName":"Abrao","id":"37270219700"},{"name":"Leonardo D. de Oliveira","affiliation":["PTC-Telecommunication and Control Engineering Department, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leonardo D.","lastName":"de Oliveira","id":"37287044700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3327-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4772704","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Parity check codes","Modulation coding","Particle swarm optimization","Throughput","Algorithm design and analysis","Detection algorithms","Channel coding","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","parity check codes","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear decoupler low-complexity MIMO detectors","tree-search reduction","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna systems","low-complexity detection schemes","particle swarm intelligence concepts","low density parity check codes","transmit antennas configuration","receive antennas configuration","QPSK modulation","LDPC coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO system","MIMO decoupler detectors","particle swarm optimization","local search","LDPC","space-time coding","LMMSE","bit-mapped coded modulation (BMCM)","VBLAST"]}],"abstract":"Since the optimal detector for coded and even uncoded multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems results too complex when the number of antennas and/or the modulation order index increases, strictly low-complexity detection schemes are considered, aiming to achieve promising performance times complexity trade-off.

Much attention has been given to MIMO systems in recent past. In this paper, analysis over the capacity of the MIMO channel systems with spatial channel has been considered when the channel state information (CSI) is considered partially or imperfect since because only partial information can be obtained at the receiver end. It is known that channel gain is maximised when CSI is available at the transmitter. It is found that in the case of partial or imperfect CSI the capacity depends on the statistical properties of the error in the CSI. Based on the knowledge of statistical distributions of the deviations in CSI knowledge, a new approach which maximises a capacity of spatial channel model has been tried.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4758659/4772668/04772708.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/WCSN.2008.4772708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSN.2008.4772708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MIMO capacity for spatial channel model with partial CSI knowledge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Intersymbol interference","Scattering","Diversity reception","Channel estimation","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","MIMO communication","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel system capacity","spatial channel model","partial CSI knowledge","multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems","single-antenna system","channel state information","error statistical properties","statistical distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MIMO capacity for spatial channel model with partial CSI knowledge","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772708/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459341","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MIMO capacity for spatial channel model with partial CSI knowledge","confLoc":"Indore, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-01282009-00040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088521S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4758659","isNumber":"4772668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4758659","xplore-issue":"4772668","articleId":"4772708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4772712,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Nallagonda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Nallagonda","id":"37394758200"},{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3327-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3328-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4772712","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Downlink","Delay","Power control","Traffic control","Physical layer","Performance analysis","Data communication","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward link performance","soft handoff effects","cellular CDMA","packet data service","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward link","ARQ","Throughput","Soft handoff"]}],"abstract":"Effects of soft handoff (HO) on forward link performance of packet data service have been presented in this paper.

A comprehensive electrodynamic analysis of the processes which take place in electrically stressed transformer oil-based nanofluids has been developed and a model is presented for streamer formation in transformer oil-based nanofluids. Through the use of numerical simulation methods the model demonstrates that conductive nanoparticles act as electron scavengers in electrically stressed transformer oil-based nanofluids converting fast electrons to slow charged particles. Due to the low mobility of these nanoparticles the development of a net space charge zone at the streamer tip is hindered suppressing the propagating electric field wave that is needed to continue electric field dependent molecular ionization and ultimately streamer propagation further into the liquid. A general expression for the charging dynamics of a nanoparticle in transformer oil with infinite conductivity is derived to show that the trapping of fast electrons onto slow conducting nanoparticles is the cause of the decrease in positive streamer velocity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2008.4772777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772762","startPage":"361","endPage":"366","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760206/4772762/04772777.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Streamer Propagation in Transformer Oil-Based Nanofluids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4772777/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Streamer Propagation in Transformer Oil-Based Nanofluids","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459362","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Streamer Propagation in Transformer Oil-Based Nanofluids","confLoc":"Quebec, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"CEIDP-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074192S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760206","isNumber":"4772762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760206","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4772762","articleId":"4772777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4772803,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It was clarified that tree initiation V-t characteristics were improved by approximately one order of magnitude for the epoxy/nanoclay composite compared to the neat epoxy resin. To be precise, such an enhancement factor is one order at high field but even two orders at low field. Formed trees are field dependent. They are rather thick and short in shape at low field, but thin and long at high field. It is concluded from the analysis on the basis of interfacial models and other studies that initial trees are formed due to a PD erosion process at low field during a long time, but due to dielectric breakdown including charge trapping at high field for a short time.","doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2008.4772803","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760206/4772762/04772803.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2008.4772803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772762","startPage":"528","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Performance of Tree Initiation V-t Characteristics of Epoxy/Clay Nanocomposite in Comparison with Neat Epoxy Resin","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Performance of Tree Initiation V-t Characteristics of Epoxy/Clay Nanocomposite in Comparison with Neat Epoxy Resin","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772803/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459381","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4772803/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Performance of Tree Initiation V-t Characteristics of Epoxy/Clay Nanocomposite in Comparison with Neat Epoxy Resin","confLoc":"Quebec, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"CEIDP-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08233S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760206","isNumber":"4772762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760206","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4772762","articleId":"4772803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4772813,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

For polyamide nanocomposites, it has become clear that the dielectric loss factor shows two peaks at around 1.9 THz and 2.7 to 3.1 THz. By referring to X-ray diffraction spectra, it is assumed that the origin of the former peak is the \u00bf-phase crystal in polyamide, and that the nanofiller loading suppresses \u00bf-phase crystallization. The latter peak shifts toward a lower frequency in the nanocomposites, which indicates that the presence of strong ionic bonds between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix restrains molecular motion and increases the relaxation time. This is believed to be the main reason of superior properties of the polymer nanocomposites.","doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2008.4772813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2008.4772813","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel5/4760206/4772762/04772813.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz Spectroscopy as a New Analyzing Tool for Dielectric Properties of Various Insulating Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Terahertz Spectroscopy as a New Analyzing Tool for Dielectric Properties of Various Insulating Materials","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444833","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahertz Spectroscopy as a New Analyzing Tool for Dielectric Properties of Various Insulating Materials","confLoc":"Quebec, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"CEIDP-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04819S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4760206","isNumber":"4772762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4760206","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4772762","articleId":"4772813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4772818,"authors":[{"name":"M.

High hardware cost of such systems is an initiative to redesign the critical functional blocks in order to satisfy timing and power constrains as well as to minimize overall circuit complexity and cost. One such critical functional block is the CoOrdinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) that can be used in various applications in OFDM systems. In this paper we apply optimization algorithms to the CORDIC processor in terms of power, area and speed for efficient FPGA implementation. Three CORDIC modules have been selected and modified to satisfy optimization requirements. The circuits have been described in Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL), synthesized, and implemented on Xilinx Spartan-3A FPGAs kit board using ISEtrade design tool suite. The prototyped results have been tested using suitable testbench waveforms. Mapping and timing reports have been summarized.

This paper presents a novel algorithm to assign the correct POS tag to those words belonging to a verb or a noun class in an Arabic text. The algorithm is based on the pattern (wazn) of the word instead of using a huge manually tagged lexicon from which large amounts of training data can be extracted.

The need to distinguish the desired details is a very important pre-process in order to give good results in short time processing. We proposed a new and fast vertical edge detection algorithm (VEDA) which is based on the contrast between the gray scale values. Once, input gray image was binarized by using adaptive threshold, unwanted lines elimination algorithm (ULEA) was proposed and applied. After that, a VEDA was applied for experimental images. Then, implementation on the application is performed and discussed in order to confirm that VEDA is robust for highlighting license plate details easily. The results revealed accurate edge detection performance and demonstrated the great efficiency of using VEDA in order to highlight license plate details. Finally, VEDA showed that it is faster than Sobel operator by about 7-9 times.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4758660/4772941/04772997.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2008.4772997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2008.4772997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4772997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new vertical edge detection algorithm and its application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Licenses","Application software","Image processing","Systems engineering and theory","Image recognition","Robustness","Data mining","Feature extraction","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical edge detection algorithm","image processing applications","car license plate detection systems","car license plate recognition systems","CLPDRS","gray image","adaptive threshold","unwanted lines elimination algorithm","Sobel operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4772997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new vertical edge detection algorithm and its application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4772997/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468477","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new vertical edge detection algorithm and its application","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-01292009-00056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046992S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4758660","isNumber":"4772941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4758660","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4772941","articleId":"4772997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4773002,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The MC DS-CDMA system achieves high spectrum efficiency by using time-frequency spreading mechanism. The probability of bit error rate (BER) of TF-domain spread MC DS-CDMA is derived using the standard Gaussian approximation (SGA) in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with frequency offset impairments. Numerical evaluation of the analytical expression of BER reveals that a high capacity and BER performance improvement are achieved over the performance of multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) system which spreads the signal in the frequency domain. Extensive simulations were also performed to illustrate the correctness of the analysis of the TF-domain spread MC DS-CDMA system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","AWGN","Performance analysis","Time frequency analysis","Gaussian approximation","Additive white noise","Signal analysis","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","AWGN channels","code division multiple access","error statistics","probability","spread spectrum communication","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier direct sequence CDMA system","frequency impairment channel","time-frequency domain spreading","MC DS-CDMA system","spectrum efficiency","bit error rate probability","standard Gaussian approximation","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division-multiple access (CDMA)","carrier frequency offset","frequency-domain spreading","multicarrier modulation","time-domain spreading"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2008.4773002","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4758660/4772941/04773002.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2008.4773002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicarrier CDMA with hybrid spreading in frequency impairment channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier CDMA with hybrid spreading in frequency impairment channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773002/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773002/","accessionNumber":"10468481","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier CDMA with hybrid spreading in frequency impairment channels","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-01292009-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050692S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4758660","isNumber":"4772941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4758660","xplore-issue":"4772941","articleId":"4773002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4773028,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We exploit the agent-oriented software paradigm with its characteristics that provide intelligent autonomous behavior together with a real time computer vision system to achieve high performance real time target tracking. The framework consists of four layers; interface, strategic, management, and operation layers. Interface layer receives from the user the tracking parameters such as the number and type of trackers and targets and type of the tracking environment, and then delivers these parameters to the subsequent layers. Strategic (decision making) layer is provided with a knowledge base of target tracking methodologies that are previously implemented by researchers in diverse target tracking applications and are proven successful. And by inference in the knowledge base using the user input a tracking methodology is chosen. Management layer is responsible for pursuing and controlling the tracking methodology execution. Operation layer represents the phases in the tracking methodology and is responsible for communicating with the real-time computer vision system to execute the algorithms in the phases. The framework is presented with a case study to show its ability to tackle the target tracking problem and its flexibility to solve the problem with different tracking parameters. This paper describes the ability of the agent-based framework to deploy any real-time vision system that fits in solving the target tracking problem. It is a step towards a complete open standard, real-time, agent-based framework for target tracking.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-agent based framework for target tracking using a real time vision system","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2008.4773028","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4758660/4772941/04773028.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2008.4773028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4772941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent based framework for target tracking using a real time vision system","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773028/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468498","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent based framework for target tracking using a real time vision system","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-01292009-00087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056563S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4758660","isNumber":"4772941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4758660","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4772941","articleId":"4773028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773063,"authors":[{"name":"Houssem Brahmi","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche CIRTACOM, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, El-Ghazalat, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Houssem","lastName":"Brahmi","id":"38017853300"},{"name":"Mourad Menif","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche CIRTACOM, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, El-Ghazalat, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Menif","id":"37268447600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3484-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3485-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4773063","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Flip-flops","Optical filters","Optical packet switching","Code division multiplexing","All-optical networks","Optical fiber filters","Filtering","Encoding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","code division multiplexing","flip-flops","optical logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-optical packet-switched routing scheme","OCDMA label","all-optical flip-flop","optical code division multiplexing","duplicated packet filtering","optical code gates","SOA-MZI","strain-tunable fiber Bragg gratings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["all-optical packet switching network","optical label switching","OCDMA label","all-optical flip-flop","SOA-MZI"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel packet-switched routing architecture for all-optical networks using optical code division multiplexing (OCDM).

However, in order to achieve the NGPON goals, the previously PON requirements, namely the passive field implementation, the compliance with the IEEE and ITU-T wavelength allocation plans, and the colourless nature of the ONUs, need to be rethought. With those requirements in mind, Raman amplification for both signal amplification and the use of the remaining power for remote pumping was proposed.

As the crosstalk in an on-chip bus is highly dependent on the data patterns transmitted on the bus, different crosstalk avoidance coding schemes have been proposed to boost the bus speed and/or reduce the overall energy consumption. Despite the availability of the codes, no systematic mapping of data words to codewords has been proposed for CODEC design. This is mainly due to the nonlinear nature of the crosstalk avoidance codes (CAC). The lack of practical CODEC construction schemes has hampered the use of such codes in practical designs. This work presents guidelines for the CODEC design of the ldquoforbidden pattern free crosstalk avoidance coderdquo (FPF-CAC). We analyze the properties of the FPF-CAC and show that mathematically, a mapping scheme exists based on the representation of numbers in the Fibonacci numeral system. Our first proposed CODEC design offers a near-optimal area overhead performance. An improved version of the CODEC is then presented, which achieves theoretical optimal performance. We also investigate the implementation details of the CODECs, including design complexity and the speed. Optimization schemes are provided to reduce the size of the CODEC and improve its speed.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4802402/04773140.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient On-Chip Crosstalk Avoidance CODEC Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773140/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient On-Chip Crosstalk Avoidance CODEC Design","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10520031","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773140/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient On-Chip Crosstalk Avoidance CODEC Design","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi12-cduan-2005313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073264S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4802402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4802402","articleId":"4773140","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773141,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn Leary","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4839067/4773141/4773141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Glenn Leary received the B.S. degree in computer systems engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, in 2005, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science.","His research interests include the areas of network-on-chip (NoC) and system-on-chip (SoC) design.

This paper presents a number of optimizations built into the skeleton and applied at compile-time depending on the user-supplied parameters.

Globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) design style can help achieve low power consumption and modularity of a design while greatly reducing the number of global interconnects. Such multiple clock domain architectures can benefit from having frequency/voltage values assigned to each domain based on workload requirements. The work presented in this paper proposes a new \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hardware-based</i>\n approach to dynamically change the frequencies and potentially voltages of a voltage-frequency island (VFI) system driven by a dynamic workload. This technique tries to change the frequency of a synchronous island such that it will have efficient power utilization while satisfying performance constraints. In recent years, there have been major developments, both in industry and academia, in the field of multiprocessor systems. Such multiprocessor systems are very good candidates for VFI design style implementation, where one or more processors can be part of a single VFI. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method, we have implemented a multiprocessor system for a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform that uses independently generated clocks for each processor. The results from the FPGA platform confirm the claim that the power consumption of a system can potentially be reduced while maintaining the performance of many applications. Our work concentrates primarily on embedded systems, but the idea can be explored for general-purpose computing as well.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4804122/04773143.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"438","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Management of Voltage/Frequency Island-Based Systems Using Hardware-Based Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Power Management of Voltage/Frequency Island-Based Systems Using Hardware-Based Methods","htmlLink":"/document/4773143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10545994","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Management of Voltage/Frequency Island-Based Systems Using Hardware-Based Methods","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi12-pchoudhary-2005309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07332S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4804122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4804122","articleId":"4773143","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773145,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Cui","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37302303700"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279255300"},{"name":"Youjian Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Youjian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37066942900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4773145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":63,"totalDownloads":1774},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773145","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Very large scale integration","Clocks","Delay","Error correction codes","Computer architecture","Routing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput layered LDPC decoding architecture","generic quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check code","QC-LDPC code","clock speed","row permutation","shuffle network","LDPC decoder","computation delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoder","error correction codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC)","quasi-cyclic (QC) codes","VLSI architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high-throughput decoder architecture for generic quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes.

Power results from the designs placed and routed in a 90-nm CMOS process show that all the architectures dissipate significant idle state power. The additional energy required to route a packet through the router is then shown to be dominated by the data path. This leads to the key result that, if this trend continues, the use of more elaborate control can be justified and will not be immediately limited by the energy budget. A performance analysis also shows that dynamic resource allocation leads to the lowest network latencies, while static allocation may be used to meet QoS goals. Combining the power and performance figures then allows an energy-latency product to be calculated to judge the efficiency of each of the networks. The speculative virtual channel router was shown to have a very similar efficiency to the wormhole router, while providing a better performance, supporting its use for general purpose designs. Finally, area metrics are also presented to allow a comparison of implementation costs.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4804122/04773148.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804122","startPage":"319","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy and Performance Exploration of Network-on-Chip Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Energy and Performance Exploration of Network-on-Chip Architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10545995","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773148/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy and Performance Exploration of Network-on-Chip Architectures","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wolkotte-2011232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0927S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4804122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4804122","articleId":"4773148","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773149,"authors":[{"name":"Hany Farid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Farid","id":"37331730100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6013"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6021"}],"articleNumber":"4773149","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":260,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2249},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773149","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Transform coding","Image coding","Quantization","Head","Image resolution","Colored noise","Terrorism","Digital forensics","Cloning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image resolution","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital forgeries","JPEG ghosts","JPEG compression quality","image resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital forensics","digital tampering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.2012215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4782049/04773149.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.2012215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exposing Digital Forgeries From JPEG Ghosts","abstract":"When creating a digital forgery, it is often necessary to combine several images, for example, when compositing one person's head onto another person's body.

Achievable rates, under this detection rule, are characterized in two scenarios. First, we consider the averaging attack where a random coding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n=2 pirates.

Overall, these results establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance decoding compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and correlation detectors which can support only a subexponential number of users (i.e., a zero rate). In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable rates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that satisfies the marking assumption.

Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we then construct coding/decoding schemes for fingerprinting based on the celebrated belief-propagation framework.

The RF power and efficiency of a new K-band amplifier are 40 W and 50% and that of a new K-band amplifier are 200 W and 60%. An important figure-of-merit, which is defined as the ratio of the RF power output to the mass (W/kg) of a traveling-wave tube (TWT), has improved by a factor of 10 over the previous generation Ka-band devices. In this paper, a high power high efficiency Ka -band combiner for multiple TWTs, based on a novel hybrid magic-T waveguide circuit design, is presented. The measured combiner efficiency is as high as 90%. In addition, at the design frequency of 32.05 GHz, error-free uncoded binary phase-shift keying/quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) data transmission at 8 Mb/s, which is typical for deep-space communications, is demonstrated. Furthermore, QPSK data transmission at 622 Mb/s is demonstrated with a low bit error rate of 2.4 times10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-8</sup>\n, which exceeds the deep-space state-of-the-art data rate transmission capability by more than two orders of magnitude.

The design is based on the principle of sliding mode control and the use of Nussbaum-type functions in solving the problem of the completely unknown control directions. It is shown that the dead-zone output can be represented as a simple linear system with a static time-varying gain and bounded disturbance by introducing characteristic function. By utilizing the integral-type Lyapunov function and introducing an adaptive compensation term for the upper bound of the optimal approximation error and the dead-zone disturbance, the closed-loop control system is proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, with tracking errors converging to zero under the condition that the slopes of unknown dead zones are equal. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2010349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4787641/04773165.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2010349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4787641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones and Control Directions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773165/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones and Control Directions","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10477145","pubMedId":"19193510","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773165/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Tracking Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Dead Zones and Control Directions","sourcePdf":"tnn-ge-2010349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103463S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4787641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"4787641","articleId":"4773165","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773167,"authors":[{"name":"Preecha P.

While the imagery may have high spatial resolution, the spectral resolution is low when lightweight off-the-shelf digital cameras are used, and the inclusion of texture measures can potentially increase the classification accuracy. Texture measures have been used widely in pixel-based image analysis, but their use in an object-based environment has not been well documented. Our objectives were to determine the most suitable texture measures and the optimal image analysis scale for differentiating rangeland vegetation using UAV imagery segmented at multiple scales. A decision tree was used to determine the optimal texture features for each segmentation scale. Results indicated the following: (1) The error rate of the decision tree was lower; (2) prediction success was higher; (3) class separability was greater; and (4) overall accuracy was higher (high 90% range) at coarser segmentation scales. The inclusion of texture measures increased classification accuracies at nearly all segmentation scales, and entropy was the texture measure with the highest score in most decision trees. The results demonstrate that UAVs are viable platforms for rangeland monitoring and that the drawbacks of low-cost off-the-shelf digital cameras can be overcome by including texture measures and using object-based image analysis which is highly suitable for very high resolution imagery.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4786573/04773214.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4786573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture and Scale in Object-Based Analysis of Subdecimeter Resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Texture and Scale in Object-Based Analysis of Subdecimeter Resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773214/","accessionNumber":"10498832","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture and Scale in Object-Based Analysis of Subdecimeter Resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-laliberte-2009355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083541S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4786573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"4786573","articleId":"4773214","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4773215,"authors":[{"name":"Chenghui Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4812115/4773215/4773215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenghui Cai (S'02\u2013M'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2008.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate of electrical and computer engineering with Duke University.

This paper develops a novel approximate cell-decomposition method in which obstacles, targets, sensor's platform, and FOV are represented as closed and bounded subsets of an Euclidean workspace. The method constructs a connectivity graph with observation cells that is pruned and transformed into a decision tree from which an optimal sensing strategy can be computed. The effectiveness of the optimal sensing strategies obtained by this methodology is demonstrated through a mine-hunting application. Numerical experiments show that these strategies outperform shortest path, complete coverage, random, and grid search strategies, and are applicable to nonoverpass capable robots that must avoid targets as well as obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2008561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2008561","startPage":"672","endPage":"689","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4812115/04773215.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-Driven Sensor Path Planning by Approximate Cell Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Information-Driven Sensor Path Planning by Approximate Cell Decomposition","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773215/","accessionNumber":"10560653","pubMedId":"19193512","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773215/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-Driven Sensor Path Planning by Approximate Cell Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ferrari-2008561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.337655S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4812115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4812115","articleId":"4773215","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":4773229,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolas Flourentzou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812314/4773229/4773229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolas Flourentzou (S'07) received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) in electronics and communications engineering from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2002, and the joint M.Sc. degree in power electronics and drives from the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2003.

Developments advance both the HVDC power transmission and the flexible ac transmission system technologies. In this paper, an overview of the recent advances in the area of voltage-source converter (VSC) HVdc technology is provided. Selected key multilevel converter topologies are presented. Control and modeling methods are discussed. A list of VSC-based HVdc installations worldwide is included. It is confirmed that the continuous development of power electronics presents cost-effective opportunities for the utilities to exploit, and HVdc remains a key technology. In particular, VSC-HVdc can address not only conventional network issues such as bulk power transmission, asynchronous network interconnections, back-to-back ac system linking, and voltage/stability support to mention a few, but also niche markets such as the integration of large-scale renewable energy sources with the grid and most recently large onshore/offshore wind farms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"24","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10586856","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773229/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"VSC-Based HVDC Power Transmission Systems: An Overview","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VSC-Based HVDC Power Transmission Systems: An Overview","sourcePdf":"tpel-flourentzou-2008441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.246629S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"1449","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4773229","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4773235,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhichao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37595541900"},{"name":"Jerry G.

RBVT protocols leverage real-time vehicular traffic information to create road-based paths consisting of successions of road intersections that have, with high probability, network connectivity among them. Geographical forwarding is used to transfer packets between intersections on the path, reducing the path's sensitivity to individual node movements. For dense networks with high contention, we optimize the forwarding using a distributed receiver-based election of next hops based on a multicriterion prioritization function that takes nonuniform radio propagation into account. We designed and implemented a reactive protocol RBVT-R and a proactive protocol RBVT-P and compared them with protocols representative of mobile ad hoc networks and VANETs. Simulation results in urban settings show that RBVT-R performs best in terms of average delivery rate, with up to a 40% increase compared with some existing protocols. In terms of average delay, RBVT-P performs best, with as much as an 85% decrease compared with the other protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773242/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10829104","volume":"58","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"VANET Routing on City Roads Using Real-Time Vehicular Traffic Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VANET Routing on City Roads Using Real-Time Vehicular Traffic Information","sourcePdf":"tvt-borcea-2014455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111988S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"314","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4773242","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773244,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwon Choi","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5204505/4773244/4773244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinwon Choi (S'08) received the B.S and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.","His current research areas are ultrawideband channel characterization, wireless sensor networks, and systems engineering of wireless systems."]},"firstName":"Jinwon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37696064200"},{"name":"Noh-Gyoung Kang","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Noh-Gyoung Kang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2007, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Since 2007, he has been with Samsung Electronics Co., Suwon, Korea.

Estimating the conditional intensity functions underlying these processes is important to characterize and decode the firing patterns of cortical neurons. This paper proposes a new approach for estimating these intensity functions directly from a compressed representation of the neurons' extracellular recordings. The approach is based on exploiting a sparse representation of the extracellular spike waveforms, previously demonstrated to yield near-optimal denoising and compression properties. We show that by restricting this sparse representation to a subset of projections that simultaneously preserve features of the spike waveforms in addition to the temporal characteristics of the underlying intensity functions, we can reasonably approximate the instantaneous firing rates of the recorded neurons with variable tuning characteristics across a multitude of time scales. Such feature is highly desirable to detect subtle temporal differences in neuronal firing characteristics from single-trial data. An added advantage of this approach is that it eliminates multiple steps from the typical processing path of neural signals that are customarily performed for instantaneous neural decoding. We demonstrate the decoding performance of the approach using a stochastic cosine tuning model of motor cortical activity during a natural, nongoal-directed 2-D arm movement.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2012711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4812307/04773250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2012711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812307","startPage":"116","endPage":"127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed and Distributed Sensing of Neuronal Activity for Real Time Spike Train Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressed and Distributed Sensing of Neuronal Activity for Real Time Spike Train Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560668","pubMedId":"19193517","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773250/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed and Distributed Sensing of Neuronal Activity for Real Time Spike Train Decoding","sourcePdf":"tnsre-koweiss-2012711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071841S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4812307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4812307","articleId":"4773250","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773257,"authors":[{"name":"Noureddine Ghoggali","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4939375/4773257/4773257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noureddine Ghoggali (S'06) received the State Engineer degree in electronics from the University of Batna, Batna, Algeria, in 2000.

Its aim is to exploit unlabeled data available at zero cost in the image under analysis for improving the accuracy of a classification process based on support vector machines (SVMs). It is based on the idea to augment the original set of training samples with a set of unlabeled samples after estimating their label. The label estimation process is performed within a multiobjective genetic optimization framework where each chromosome of the evolving population encodes the label estimates as well as the SVM classifier parameters for tackling the model selection issue. Such a process is guided by the joint minimization of two different criteria which express the generalization capability of the SVM classifier. The two explored criteria are an empirical risk measure and an indicator of the classification model sparseness, respectively. The experimental results obtained on two multisource remote sensing data sets confirm the promising capabilities of the proposed approach, which allows the following: (1) taking a clear advantage in terms of classification accuracy from unlabeled samples used for inflating the original training set and (2) solving automatically the tricky model selection issue.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2007128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4939375/04773257.pdf","startPage":"1707","endPage":"1718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2007128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiobjective Genetic SVM Approach for Classification Problems With Limited Training Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773257/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Genetic SVM Approach for Classification Problems With Limited Training Samples","volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664034","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773257/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Genetic SVM Approach for Classification Problems With Limited Training Samples","sourcePdf":"tgrs-melgani-2007128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063055S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4939375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4939375","articleId":"4773257","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773259,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Adib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812316/4773259/4773259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Adib (S'08) was born in Isfahan, Iran, in 1982.

By using this system, students are able to program experiments remotely via the Web, in order to combine the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to provide real-time vision processing, a conveyor belt, and a Motoman industrial manipulator. This paper introduces the novel SNRP protocol (i.e., Simple Network Robot Protocol), which permits the integration of network robots and sensors within an e-learning platform in a simple and reliable manner. As long as the students are able to interact remotely with a real robotic scenario, this system helps students very much to learn robotics control techniques like visual servoing control, vision for industrial applications, and robotics manipulation. The various components of the system are connected via a 100BaseT Ethernet network and follow the SNRP protocol, which grants simple access to generic networked devices using enhanced HTTP-based connections. Moreover, the whole telelaboratory is connected to the Internet through a router that permits the user to control the networked devices according to security constraints. The SNRP architecture is compared with a Common Object Request Broker Architecture-based approach, which was used in a previous telelaboratory. This paper describes two principle contributions: the design of a novel SNRP network architecture for the intercommunication of robots and sensors within an e-learning telelaboratory and the integration of a programmable FPGA vision system, which allows students to learn not only robotic techniques but also the design of high-performance circuits for industrial vision applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10959267","htmlLink":"/document/4773261/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Remote Programming of Network Robots Within the UJI Industrial Robotics Telelaboratory: FPGA Vision and SNRP Network Protocol","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Programming of Network Robots Within the UJI Industrial Robotics Telelaboratory: FPGA Vision and SNRP Network Protocol","sourcePdf":"tie-marin-2013250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098668S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5291658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5291658","articleId":"4773261","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773265,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Rothenhagen","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, Christian-Albrechts University, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/4773265/4773265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Rothenhagen (S'07) was born in Kiel, Germany, in 1977.

The new model allows the extension of the input domain for supervised neural networks to a general class of graphs including both acyclic/cyclic, directed/undirected labeled graphs. In particular, the model can realize adaptive contextual transductions, learning the mapping from graphs for both classification and regression tasks. In contrast to previous neural networks for structures that had a recursive dynamics, NN4G is based on a constructive feedforward architecture with state variables that uses neurons with no feedback connections. The neurons are applied to the input graphs by a general traversal process that relaxes the constraints of previous approaches derived by the causality assumption over hierarchical input data. Moreover, the incremental approach eliminates the need to introduce cyclic dependencies in the definition of the system state variables. In the traversal process, the NN4G units exploit (local) contextual information of the graphs vertices. In spite of the simplicity of the approach, we show that, through the compositionality of the contextual information developed by the learning, the model can deal with contextual information that is incrementally extended according to the graphs topology. The effectiveness and the generality of the new approach are investigated by analyzing its theoretical properties and providing experimental results.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"498","endPage":"511","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2010350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2010350","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4787641/04773279.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4787641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network for Graphs: A Contextual Constructive Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773279/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network for Graphs: A Contextual Constructive Approach","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10477133","pubMedId":"19193509","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4773279/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network for Graphs: A Contextual Constructive Approach","sourcePdf":"tnn-micheli-2010350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096337S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4787641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"4787641","articleId":"4773279","onlineDate":"03 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4773280,"authors":[{"name":"Sunhong Park","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4773280/4773280-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sunhong Park received the B.S. degree in electronic physics from Daejeon University, Daejeon, Korea, in 2004, and the Master's degree in applied physics from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Advanced Science and Engineering.","His research interests include mobile robotics and radio-frequency identification technology.","Mr. Park is a member of The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers."]},"firstName":"Sunhong","lastName":"Park","id":"37635281000"},{"name":"Shuji Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5154028/4773280/4773280-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shuji Hashimoto received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in applied physics from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1970 and 1977, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Applied Physics, Waseda University.

We assume that the robot is able to identify IC tags and measure the robot's pose based on the relation between the previous and current location according to the IC tags. However, there arises the problem of uncertainty of location due to the nature of the antenna and IC tags. In other words, an error is always present which is relative to the sensing area of the antenna. Many researches have used external sensors in order to reduce the location errors, with few researches presented involving purely RFID driven systems. Our proposed algorithm that uses only passive RFID is able to estimate the robot's location and orientation more precisely by using trigonometric functions and the IC tags' Cartesian coordinates in a regular gridlike pattern.

Analytic calculations demonstrate that reducing the diameter of the gain dopants compared to the waveguide diameter produces differential gain that is higher for the fundamental mode than all other fiber modes at all saturation levels. Matching the gain dopant to the mode profile is not as beneficial as a simple step profile since the primary mechanism of gain filtering is to deny gain toward the edge of the waveguide where most of the higher order mode power is contained. Numerical simulations of multikilowatt fiber amplifiers with up to 100-mum-diameter cores show that gain filtering is extremely robust, providing 99% of the output power in the fundamental mode output with only 90% of the seed power in the fundamental mode. Even with poor seed launch with 50% of the power in the fundamental mode, gain filtering can provide up to 90% of the output power in the fundamental mode.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773298/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10460211","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Gain Filtering for Single-Spatial-Mode Operation of Large-Mode-Area Fiber Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain Filtering for Single-Spatial-Mode Operation of Large-Mode-Area Fiber Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jstqe-marciante-2010272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0436S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4773293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4773293","articleId":"4773298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4773306,"authors":[{"name":"Yin-Wen Lee","affiliation":["Ginzton Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/4773293/4773306/4773306-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yin-Wen Lee received the B.S. degree in atomic science and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

To quantify these predictions, we show through numerical simulations that double-clad phosphate fibers should produce as much as ~ 700 W of single-frequency output power in a step index, single-mode core.

ASAR GM mode has delivered the first global multiyear C-band backscatter data set in HH polarization at a spatial resolution of 1 km. This paper investigates if ASAR GM can be used for retrieving soil moisture using a change detection approach over large regions. A method previously developed for the European Remote Sensing (ERS) scatterometer is adapted for use with ASAR GM and tested over Oklahoma, USA. The ASAR-GM-derived relative soil moisture index is compared to 50-km ERS soil moisture data and pointlike \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">situ</i>\n measurements from the Oklahoma MESONET.

The analysis suggests that this is mainly due to the much higher noise level of ASAR GM compared to the ERS scatterometer. Therefore, some spatial averaging to 3-10 km is recommended to reduce the noise of the ASAR GM soil moisture images. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that ASAR GM allows resolving spatial details in the soil moisture patterns not observable in the ERS scatterometer measurements while still retaining the basic capability of the ERS scatterometer to capture temporal trends over large areas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4773457/04773463.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773457","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using ENVISAT ASAR Global Mode Data for Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Over Oklahoma, USA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface soil","Information retrieval","Radar measurements","Soil moisture","Soil measurements","Spatial resolution","Moisture measurement","Synthetic aperture radar","Satellites","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","data assimilation","geophysical techniques","moisture","remote sensing by radar","soil","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface soil moisture","Oklahoma","USA","advanced synthetic aperture radar","ASAR","global mode data","C-band backscatter data","HH polarization","spatial resolution","change detection","ERS scatterometer","MESONET","radiometer measurement","data assimilation","ENVISAT","European Remote Sensing scatterometer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change detection","ScanSAR","scatterometer","soil moisture","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using ENVISAT ASAR Global Mode Data for Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Over Oklahoma, USA","volume":"47","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4773463/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470392","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using ENVISAT ASAR Global Mode Data for Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Over Oklahoma, USA","sourcePdf":"tgrs-pathe-2004711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145321S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4773457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"4773457","articleId":"4773463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4773467,"authors":[{"name":"Irena Hajnsek","affiliation":["Polarimetric SAR Interferometry Research Group, Radar Concepts Department, German Aerospace Center, Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4773457/4773467/4773467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Irena Hajnsek (A'01\u2013M'01) received the Dipl. degree (with honors) from the Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree (with honors) from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Jena, Germany, in 2001.","From 1996 to 1999, she was a Project Scientist with the Microwaves and Radar Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany.

Soil-moisture estimation by means of SAR is a topic that is intensively investigated but yet not solved satisfactorily. The key problem is the presence of vegetation cover which biases soil-moisture estimates. In this paper, we discuss the problem of soil-moisture estimation in the presence of agricultural vegetation by means of L-band PolSAR images. SAR polarimetry allows the decomposition of the scattering signature into canonical scattering components and their quantification. We discuss simple canonical models for surface, dihedral, and vegetation scattering and use them to model and interpret scattering processes. The performance and modifications of the individual scattering components are discussed. The obtained surface and dihedral components are then used to retrieve surface soil moisture. The investigations cover, for the first time, the whole vegetation-growing period for three crop types using SAR data and ground measurements acquired in the frame of the AgriSAR campaign.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4773457/04773468.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773457","startPage":"442","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Potential of Estimating Soil Moisture Under Vegetation Cover by Means of PolSAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Potential of Estimating Soil Moisture Under Vegetation Cover by Means of PolSAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470399","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773468/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential of Estimating Soil Moisture Under Vegetation Cover by Means of PolSAR","sourcePdf":"tgrs-hajnsek-2009642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102884S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4773457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"4773457","articleId":"4773468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4773475,"authors":[{"name":"Brian L.

Experimental results using industrial bulk CMOS models show that the results are in excellent agreement with SPICE results and 65\u00d7 faster.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Root-Finding Methods for Assessing SRAM Stability in the Presence of Random Dopant Fluctuations","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2008.2011662","startPage":"22","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2008.2011662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4773471/04773499.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Root-Finding Methods for Assessing SRAM Stability in the Presence of Random Dopant Fluctuations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4773499/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10445095","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Root-Finding Methods for Assessing SRAM Stability in the Presence of Random Dopant Fluctuations","sourcePdf":"22tsm01-rkanj-2011662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067212S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4773471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4773471","articleId":"4773499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773505,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/4773471/4773505/4773505-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Victoria Wang (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2005.

There are several researchers who calculated L' using different numerical and analytical methods in these years. The analytical method to solve the simple problems is suitable, and numerical methods include sufficient coding time and programmer performance time. A method will be introduced in this paper to extract a formula or formulas of L' using structural railgun parameters which can cause the results similar to the results of the numerical methods. This method has not any time problem, and so, there is a good accuracy of data analysis. In this technique, which is called intelligent estimation method, according to the behavior of the railgun magnetism and its geometrical structure, an equation with unknown multiplications for L' formula is defined. Then, by applying the reported data in different studies for L', these equations can be found. Finally, the proposed method introduces a closed formula for a given structure of railgun.

These efforts include fundamental research on materials, properties of materials subjected to electromagnetic and thermal stresses, railguns (particularly the rail-armature sliding interface), coilguns, and energy storage and power conditioning. There is also broad and growing interest in novel applications of electromagnetic launch. For example, a supersonic beam of neon atoms have been slowed and stopped, opening the door for investigating the atomic and molecular properties of most of the periodic table of atoms and certain molecules. Research is continuing on magnetic brakes and the more traditional research on the launch of materials to hypervelocities. More recently, the launching of materials into the Earth's orbit or even deeper in space is obtaining renewed interest. Consequently, some attention is being given to the types of materials of projectiles for hypersonic flight. The U.S. Navy has initiated new multidisciplinary university research teams including physics, chemistry, and materials science to develop new diagnostic tools and to provide a more detailed examination of the rail-armature interface. Most significantly, the U.S. Army has elevated its emphasis from electromagnetic launch science and technology development to the operational consequences of long-range precision fires. In concert with the recent U.S. Navy efforts on long-range fires, it is anticipated that the pull of these applications will enable even greater advances in the science and technology of electromagnetic launch.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4773510/04773558.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in Electromagnetic Launch Science and Technology and Its Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773558/","displayDocTitle":"Advances in Electromagnetic Launch Science and Technology and Its Applications","volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470560","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773558/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in Electromagnetic Launch Science and Technology and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tmag-fair-part2-2008612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119972S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4773510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4773510","articleId":"4773558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773564,"authors":[{"name":"Yanhua Sun","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yanhua Sun received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Asrtonautics, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1994, 1997, and 2001, respectively.","He is now with the School of Mechanical Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University as an Associate Professor.

We define and calculate the dynamic current stiffness and displacement stiffness using both an analytical method and transient finite element (FE) analysis. We present a simple magnetic circuit model including eddy currents from which the two stiffnesses can be derived analytically. Furthermore, by using a transient analysis of the FE model, flux saturation, leakage, and fringing effects can all be taken into account. We show that the two stiffnesses have the same frequency response characteristics, both in the analytical model and from the results of the linear FE analysis, when the leakage and fringing effects are ignored. Even in the more practical case when the flux saturation, leakage and fringing effects are considered, the two stiffnesses can be considered to have the same frequency response characteristics within the 3 dB bandwidth without introducing much error. The open-loop frequency response of the two stiffnesses derived from the analytical model and the FE model agrees well with the experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2005795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4773508/04773564.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"149","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2005795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Stiffnesses of Active Magnetic Thrust Bearing Including Eddy-Current Effects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Stiffnesses of Active Magnetic Thrust Bearing Including Eddy-Current Effects","volume":"45","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4773564/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470527","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Stiffnesses of Active Magnetic Thrust Bearing Including Eddy-Current Effects","sourcePdf":"tmag-yicksing-2005795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060497S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4773508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4773508","articleId":"4773564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4773566,"authors":[{"name":"Ian R.

In the railgun operation, the initial contact pressure is provided by the interference pressure between the armature and the rail. As the magnetic field is established in the bore, the electromagnetic force provides the contact pressure, as the initial contact pressure reduces due to wear or contact melting. Excessive initial contact pressure may delay the motion of the armature and cause overheating of the armature. On the other hand, insufficient initial pressure would result in contact separation of armature and rail. The contact interface is never perfectly smooth. It only contacts at discrete asperities at micro scale and at discrete points due to deformation of the contact interface at macro scale. The interface characteristics are different from the bulk behavior. A detailed model of contact resistivity is essential to compute the interfacial current density and temperature distributions accurately. A contact resistivity model was developed that is a function of contact pressure, the hardness of the softer contact member, average bulk resistivity, and contact constants. The model was implemented into the code EMAP3D. This paper presents the simulation results of the start-up of a sample railgun with and without contact resistivity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4773510/04773591.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Pressure-Dependent Contact Resistivity on Contact Interfacial Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Contacts","Railguns","Rails","Interference","Magnetic fields","Boring","Electromagnetic forces","Delay","Computer interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical contacts","electromagnetic forces","magnetic fields","railguns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pressure-dependent contact resistivity","contact interfacial conditions","electrical contacts","contact separation force","current constriction effects","railgun operation","magnetic field","electromagnetic force","contact pressure","armature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contact resistivity","sliding electrical contact (SEC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Pressure-Dependent Contact Resistivity on Contact Interfacial Conditions","volume":"45","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4773591/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470575","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Pressure-Dependent Contact Resistivity on Contact Interfacial Conditions","sourcePdf":"45tmag01-khsieh-part2-2008876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036527S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4773510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4773510","articleId":"4773591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773610,"authors":[{"name":"Riccardo Ciolini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Systems and Automation (DSEA), University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","French German Research Institute of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, France"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Ciolini","id":"37869283300"},{"name":"Markus Schneider","affiliation":["French German Research Institute of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, France"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37531109800"},{"name":"Bernardo Tellini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Systems and Automation (DSEA), University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Bernardo","lastName":"Tellini","id":"37274819300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4773610","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper deals with experiments and calculations performed in order to investigate the influence of the electromagnetic hardening of payloads in a railgun. This is a complex task: besides the large amplitudes of the in-bore magnetic fields due to the pulsed current, the exit of the projectile from the muzzle and the consequences of plasma arcs have to be considered. At the muzzle the magnetic induction can drop from several Teslas to zero within some microseconds, leading to very high induced voltages and electric fields in the metallic parts of the projectile. On the other hand, the electric contact established by solid armatures tends to develop into electric arcs at high velocities during the launch. These plasma arcs as well as the closing switch transients of the railgun circuit are a source of electromagnetic radiation in a broad spectral range. Some electronic devices were selected and tested with static setups corresponding to the previous conditions. In a first phase a series of static railgun experiments (no projectile movement) was performed. In a second phase, static experiments simulating the muzzle exit conditions were carried out. Finally, the influence of electromagnetic waves emitted during railgun experiments on electronic devices was investigated, using a static setup with a conventional spark gap.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4773510/04773610.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.2008431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Use of Electronic Components in Railgun Projectiles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic components","Railguns","Projectiles","Switches","Payloads","Magnetic fields","Plasmas","Voltage","Contacts","Solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","projectiles","railguns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic hardening","payload","railgun projectile","plasma arcs","electronic component","closing switch transients","electromagnetic radiation","muzzle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coil","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic field","magnetic field","payloads","railgun","spark gap"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Use of Electronic Components in Railgun Projectiles","volume":"45","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4773610/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470590","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Electronic Components in Railgun Projectiles","sourcePdf":"45tmag01-mschneider-part2-2008431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086874S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4773510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4773510","articleId":"4773610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4773654,"authors":[{"name":"Takamasa Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Takamasa Hasegawa","id":"37291226000"},{"name":"Rui Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Rui Zhou","id":"37286849700"},{"name":"Iwao Sasase","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Iwao Sasase","id":"37268382400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773654","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interchannel interference","Throughput","OFDM","Computer simulation","Frequency conversion","Radio control","Signal to noise ratio","Computer science","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","cochannel interference","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","probability","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation scheme","multicell OFDMA","channel allocation","beacon signal estimation","co-channel interference reduction","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access system","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Resource Allocation","Multi-Cell"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme that limits allocating sub-channels to other cells based on the amount of interference estimated by beacon signals from adjacent cellspsila BSs (base station) to users to reduce the co-channel interference and re-allocates sub-channels to cell-edge users in multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) system.

However, mitigation of MAI (multi access interference) is not done in the conventional MWML-OOC optical CDMA. Therefore users who demand high QoS cannot achieve bit error rate (BER) performance less than or equal to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n due to the effect of the MAI. Moreover, general error correcting codes require the addition of the redundancy bits or an increase in number of weights, where the redundancy bits cause the decrease at the transmission rate, and the increase in the number of weights causes a decrease in the number of codes. In this paper, we apply SOC (super-orthogonal code) which can correct errors without adding redundant bits as well as increasing in number of weight for MWML-OOC optical CDMA to mitigate MAI. Since our scheme can reduce the number of optical pulses, the proposed scheme can mitigate the effect of MAI compared with the conventional scheme. We show that the proposed scheme can improve the BER performance in comparison with the conventional scheme.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773676.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MWML-OOC multimedia optical CDMA using SOC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773676/","displayDocTitle":"MWML-OOC multimedia optical CDMA using SOC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468610","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773676/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MWML-OOC multimedia optical CDMA using SOC","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050077S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4773678,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiko Yamazoe","affiliation":["Engineering Administration Department, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yamazoe","id":"37563594800"},{"name":"Kazuhisa Haeiwa","affiliation":["Hiroshima City University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhisa","lastName":"Haeiwa","id":"37282458000"},{"name":"Shoji Hirose","affiliation":["Engineering Administration Department, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37690330600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773678","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium","High power amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Operational amplifiers","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Wideband","Impedance matching","Coaxial cables","Tuned circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","HF amplifiers","power amplifiers","transformers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HF power amplifier","wideband power amplifier","short wave band","class-E amplifier","transformer","coaxial cables","circuit combiner","balun"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-wave","High-efficiency","class-E","Power amplifier","Transmitter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773678","doi":"10.3169/itej.62.1077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.3169/itej.62.1077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773678.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a High efficiency HF power amplifier","abstract":"This paper describes development of a High efficiency HF power amplifier.

After minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation in time direction, channel interpolation must be performed in frequency direction. Recent DFT-based algorithms, in MIMO-OFDM systems, reduce additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) and Inter-Channel Interference (ICI) iteratively, through time domain low-pass filtering in each iteration. Here, it is shown that extending the algorithm used for OFDM systems to be used for MIMO-OFDM systems causes some frequency shift. The proposed algorithm compensates this shift. Then, the iterations become useless and the complexity reduces considerably. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm slightly outperforms the iterative algorithm in addition to complexity reduction by eliminating iterations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Iterative algorithms","OFDM","Frequency estimation","AWGN","MIMO","Mean square error methods","Estimation error","Interpolation","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","mobile communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noniterative MMSE","mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","noniterative rectangular type pilot aided channel estimation algorithm","mobile multiple input-multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","minimum mean square error estimation","time direction","channel interpolation","frequency shift comoensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFT-based interpolation","MIMO-OFDM","MMSE","Non-iterative channel estimation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773680.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-iterative MMSE-based channel estimation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non-iterative MMSE-based channel estimation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10468614","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773680/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-iterative MMSE-based channel estimation for mobile MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109898S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4773683,"authors":[{"name":"Yousi Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Lab on Microwave & Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yousi Zheng","id":"37311270700"},{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["State Key Lab on Microwave & Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Wan","id":"37306411400"},{"name":"Shunliang Mei","affiliation":["State Key Lab on Microwave & Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shunliang Mei","id":"37276289600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773683","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Algorithm design and analysis","Electromagnetic spectrum","Information analysis","Measurement errors","Optimization methods","Narrowband","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed algorithms","radio direction-finding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust distributed localization algorithm","cognitive radio","electromagnetic spectrum sources","radio-sensing analysis process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","localization","distributed"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust distributed localization algorithm for cognitive radio","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773683.pdf","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773683","abstract":"As a novel technique which can effectively improve precious electromagnetic spectrum sources, cognitive radio is widely discussed in various aspects.

For example, a system with 31times1 Gbit/s users and wavelength interval of 1.0 nm has a maximum transmission length of 16 km when transmitted power per bit is 0 dBm. Although, the impact of GVD is reduced when wavelength interval is decreased to 0.4 nm, it is still relatively strong. A power penalty of up to 8 dB is seen in the SAE/OCDMA system with the transmission length of 33 km. In addition, we propose a method to combat the impact of GVD, which can increase the maximum transmission length of SAE/OCDMA systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773700.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance degradation of spectral amplitude encoding optical code division multiple access systems due to group velocity dispersion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Encoding","Multiaccess communication","Optical pulses","Optical receivers","Optical propagation","Multiple access interference","Optical noise","Optical fiber dispersion","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral amplitude encoding","optical code division multiple access systems","group velocity dispersion","Gaussian pulse propagation","optical fiber transmission length","SAE-OCDMA system","GVD","BER","power penalty","bit rate 1 Gbit/s","distance 16 km","distance 33 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance degradation of spectral amplitude encoding optical code division multiple access systems due to group velocity dispersion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468630","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance degradation of spectral amplitude encoding optical code division multiple access systems due to group velocity dispersion","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081571S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773702,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Hiraga","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Hiraga","id":"37312933400"},{"name":"Kazunori Akabane","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Akabane","id":"37698981200"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Shiba","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Shiba","id":"37325391800"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Uehara","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37312196600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773702","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Frequency","Wireless communication","Radio spectrum management","Technology management","Computer simulation","Cellular phones","Technological innovation","Laboratories","Telegraphy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio systems","dynamic channel assignment","channel reallocation","wireless communication services","frequency resource","access points","computer simulation","frequency utilization efficiency criterion"]}],"abstract":"Wireless communication services have been increasing rapidly and this progress has caused a shortage in frequency resources. Cognitive radio technology is expected to enable frequency resources to be used more efficiently. When several wireless communication systems simultaneously use cognitive radio technology, the priority level of each system for frequency use is set and the frequency resource is shared between the systems according to the priority level. In cognitive radio systems, algorithms for channel assignment to access points (AP) have to manage priority levels in frequency use. The conventional dynamic channel assignment (DCA) technology cannot be used in cognitive radio systems without modification since the technology does not have the scheme to manage priority level in the frequency use. We have proposed methods of channel assignment and channel reallocation that are suitable for cognitive radio systems and evaluated our proposed methods using a computer simulation. In addition, we have proposed a new frequency utilization efficiency criterion for cognitive radio systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773702.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel assignment and reallocation algorithms for cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel assignment and reallocation algorithms for cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773702/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773702/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459515","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel assignment and reallocation algorithms for cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067425S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4773710,"authors":[{"name":"Nataphat Promsuvana","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Nataphat","lastName":"Promsuvana","id":"38096460100"},{"name":"Peerapong Uthansakul","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication Engineering, Suranaree University\uc2a0of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand"],"firstName":"Peerapong","lastName":"Uthansakul","id":"37279043200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773710","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"abstract":"The knowledge of state information (CSI) is necessary to be known at transmitter in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system in order to improve the capacity performance. Among methods to realize CSI at transmitter, the use of reciprocity principle is the most attractive technique for implementation. This is because CSI at transmitter is easily estimated by the reverse channel where the forward and reverse channels are symmetrically considered in time, frequency and location. In frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, forward and reverse links are allocated by different frequency thus channel reciprocity fails under this condition. In this paper, the capacity performances of adaptive 4times4 MIMO system based on measured data are presented. Also the feasible method to compensate the differences between TDD and FDD channels is studied. The results reveal that the capacity of adaptive MIMO system in FDD mode can be improved by compensation technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of adaptive 4\u00d74 MIMO system using channel reciprocity in FDD mode","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","MIMO","Radio transmitters","Frequency conversion","Feedback","Frequency estimation","Radio spectrum management","Receiving antennas","Radio frequency","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency allocation","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","channel reciprocity","channel state information","channel estimation","frequency division duplex","time division duplex","frequency allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","FDD","Performance","Compensation","Measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of adaptive 4\u00d74 MIMO system using channel reciprocity in FDD mode","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773710/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468638","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of adaptive 4\u00d74 MIMO system using channel reciprocity in FDD mode","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054885S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4773713,"authors":[{"name":"Sousuke Tokunaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan"],"lastName":"Sousuke Tokunaga","id":"38189229800"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kawakami","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Japan"],"lastName":"Yoshihisa Kawakami","id":"38185948200"},{"name":"Kenichi Hashimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan"],"lastName":"Kenichi Hashimoto","id":"38189827500"},{"name":"Shigeru Tomisato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan"],"lastName":"Shigeru Tomisato","id":"37327873900"},{"name":"Satoshi Denno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Satoshi Denno","id":"37279596500"},{"name":"Masaharu Hata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan"],"lastName":"Masaharu Hata","id":"38268881400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773713","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensor systems","Collaboration","Array signal processing","Energy consumption","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Power engineering and energy","Electronic mail","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","ubiquitous computing","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power saving effect","sensor collaborative beamforming","wireless ubiquitous network system","transmission performance","power consumption","signal transmission","collaborative sensors","free-space propagation channel","mobile propagation channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor Network","Transmit Beamforming","Sensor Collaboration"]}],"abstract":"This paper evaluates transmission performance and power-saving effect of the collaborative beamforming for wireless ubiquitous network systems. The evaluation of power-saving includes the power consumption for signal transmission to collaborative sensors in beamforming. The simulation result shows that the total power consumption of the beamforming with 3 collaborative sensors can be decreased to about 1/2 compared with that of a transmitting sensor without the beamforming in free-space propagation channels. In typical mobile propagation channels with shadowing, the total power consumption of the beamforming by using 3 collaborative sensors can be reduced to 1/7 of that without the beamforming. The above results confirm that the collaborative beamforming can be achieve lower power consumption, and greatly contributes to realize low-power transmission in wireless sensor network systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773713.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power saving effect of sensor collaborative beamforming for wireless ubiquitous network systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power saving effect of sensor collaborative beamforming for wireless ubiquitous network systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773713/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773713/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468640","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power saving effect of sensor collaborative beamforming for wireless ubiquitous network systems","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095598S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773718,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchi Zhu","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Jianchi Zhu","id":"37634304800"},{"name":"Jingxiu Liu","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Jingxiu Liu","id":"37292082100"},{"name":"Xiaoming She","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoming She","id":"37408502900"},{"name":"Lan Chen","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Lan Chen","id":"37292795300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773718","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":732},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Array signal processing","Covariance matrix","System performance","Statistics","Transmitting antennas","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding techniques","E-UTRA","proposed adaptive precoding","MIMO systems","codebook based multiple-input multiple-output precoding","evolved UTRA","unitary precoding","zero-forcing beamforming","Grassmannian codebook","DFT codebook","semistatically switch","long term information","system load","channel statistics","adaptive scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive precoding","MIMO","codebook","SU-MIMO","MU-MIMO","Unitary Precoding","Zero-forcing beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Codebook based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding can significantly improve the system spectral efficiency with limited feedback and has been accepted as one of the most promising techniques for the Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA). In this paper, firstly, we investigate precoding techniques through system-level simulation in EUTRA environment including various precoding modes, precoding methods and codebooks. Then, to further exploit the system performance in universal environments, an adaptive MIMO precoding scheme is proposed, in which different precoding modes including single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), precoding methods including unitary precoding (UP) and zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF) for MU-MIMO, and codebooks including Grassmannian codebook and DFT codebook for MU-MIMO with ZF-BF, are semi-statically switched based on long-term information, system load and channel statistics. Particularly, the proposed scheme is much feasible for practical systems and the increase of signaling overhead can be negligible. Finally, it can be seen from the simulation results that, compared with conventional schemes with fixed precoding technique, proposed adaptive scheme can yield much improvement on spectral efficiency.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773718.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on precoding techniques in E-UTRA and proposed adaptive precoding scheme for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on precoding techniques in E-UTRA and proposed adaptive precoding scheme for MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773718/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459519","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773718/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on precoding techniques in E-UTRA and proposed adaptive precoding scheme for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085341S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773719,"authors":[{"name":"Yingji Zhong","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communication Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea","School oflnfonnation Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Yingji Zhong","id":"37401259300"},{"name":"Kyung Sup Kwak","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communication Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea","School oflnfonnation Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Kyung Sup Kwak","id":"37280638100"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["UWB Wireless Communication Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea","School oflnfonnation Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Dongfeng Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773719","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","MIMO","Frequency","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Wireless sensor networks","Network topology","Proposals","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless communication","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","MIMO communication","scheduling","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel resource assignment","cross layer MIMO cooperative scheduling scheme","hybrid sensor networks","network topology","relative energy consumption","end-to-end blocking probability","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross Layer","MIMO","Cooperative Scheduling","Hybrid Sensor Networks"]}],"abstract":"The multi-scenario topology of the hybrid sensor networks is studied and a novel MIMO channel resource assignment cross layer cooperative scheduling scheme (CRA-CCSS) is proposed in this paper.

Some fundamental principles to achieve optimality are given while a few subcarrier and power allocation algorithms are proposed. The performance of these resource allocation algorithms is evaluated by computer simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation in relay-assistant OFDMA cellular system","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773726.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier and power allocation in relay-assistant OFDMA cellular system","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773726/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459523","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier and power allocation in relay-assistant OFDMA cellular system","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071445S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773732,"authors":[{"name":"Asako Nakano","affiliation":["France Telecom Group, Orange Labs Tokyo, Shinjuku Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Asako","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37088436757"},{"name":"Wladimir Bocquet","affiliation":["France Telecom Group, Orange Labs Tokyo, Shinjuku Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wladimir","lastName":"Bocquet","id":"37564494700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773732","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a dynamic method for resource assignment by implementing a cross-layer design for Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems that adapts user allocation to channel fluctuations. Our approach consists of prioritizing users according to their class of service (CoS), assigning them to the best subchannels based on channel estimates, and allowing redundancy of assignment in case of strong degradation of otherspsila signals. This improves upon the performance of the existing methods by allowing adaptation to the system parameters. This technique has been implemented in software and validated experimentally, bringing about 6 dB gain for a bit error rate (BER) of 10-3 in a multipath fading environment with 16 users for 8 available codes, compared to the classic round robin (RR) assignment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Assignment for MC-CDMA with prioritization and QoS constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Bit error rate","Cross layer design","Resource management","Fluctuations","Redundancy","Degradation","Gain","Fading","Round robin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","code division multiple access","error statistics","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic resource assignment","multicarrier code division multiple access","bit error rate","user allocation","cross-layer design","class of service","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-Layer Design","Dynamic Resource Assignment","MC-CDMA","Multi-Code Diversity","Multi-User Diversity","Quality of Service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Assignment for MC-CDMA with prioritization and QoS constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773732/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10690983","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Assignment for MC-CDMA with prioritization and QoS constraint","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061487S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773733,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yan","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Yan","id":"37671717100"},{"name":"Anxin Li","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Anxin Li","id":"37400035100"},{"name":"Hidetoshi Kayama","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Hidetoshi Kayama","id":"37296977000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773733","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"abstract":"IMT-advanced is expected to provide much higher cell spectrum efficiency than current cellular systems.

To enhance the performance, sequence detection schemes have been proposed with the availability of corresponding channel state information (CSI), which is generally obtained via channel estimation using some inserted preamble symbols. However, bandwidth efficiency is significantly degraded and long latency is introduced. In this work, without the need of inserting preamble symbols, we propose a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation method coupled with the Viterbi-algorithm based maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) scheme to improve bandwidth efficiency and to minimize the detection latency. Hence this proposed scheme can be applied to real-time, delay-sensitive applications. Compared to other pilot-based ICI mitigation methods, our scheme has better performance, as well as better bandwidth efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLSD coupled with LMMSE channel estimation for OFDM in time-variant channels","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773742.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"MLSD coupled with LMMSE channel estimation for OFDM in time-variant channels","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773742/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459524","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLSD coupled with LMMSE channel estimation for OFDM in time-variant channels","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056374S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773743,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Hui Yang","id":"38187634400"},{"name":"Jung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Chieh Chen","id":"37280673400"},{"name":"Ya-Ting Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ya-Ting Chan","id":"38187685800"},{"name":"Ming-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Yu Lin","id":"38189246500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773743","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Hardware","Bit error rate","Sum product algorithm","Joining processes","Mice","Logic gates","Costs","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","parity check codes","product codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check decoder","log sum-product algorithm","log-SPA LDPC decoder","addition operation","logical OR operation","bit error rate","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC decoding","Sum-product algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A low hardware cost low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder is presented in this paper.

CDTD simultaneously transmits the same signal from different antennas after adding different cyclic delays to increase the number of equivalent propagation paths and hence achieves the larger frequency diversity gain. However, the BER performance of DS-CDMA with CDTD using MMSE-FDE is limited by the residual inter-chip interference (ICI) after FDE.

Furthermore, the convergence of RLMS is quite insensitive to changes in either signal-to-noise ratio, or the initial value of the input correlation matrix for the RLS section, or the step size adopted for the LMS section.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773748.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive array beam forming using a combined RLS-LMS algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4773748/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive array beam forming using a combined RLS-LMS algorithm","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468663","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive array beam forming using a combined RLS-LMS algorithm","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047678S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4773749,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Whan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Whan Lee","id":"38190161800"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Kim","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Ho Kim","id":"38190668100"},{"name":"Hyeong-Joo Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyeong-Joo Oh","id":"38126057800"},{"name":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","id":"37292257600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773749","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":464},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Frequency","Signal detection","Computer vision","Fading","Shadow mapping","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detector","adaptive-fixed thresholds","cognitive radio system","spectrum utilization","spectrum band detection","spectrum sensing","communication channel","ROC curve","interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","primary user","secondary user","energy detector","fixed threshold","adaptive threshold"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio systems offer the opportunity to improve spectrum utilization by detecting unused spectrum bands while avoiding the interference to primary users.

Frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion can take advantage of the channel frequency-selectivity and improve the average bit error rate (BER) performance of single-code MC-CDMA due to frequency-diversity gain. However, as the code multiplexing order is increased so as to increase the data rate without bandwidth expansion, the presence of residual inter-code interference (ICI) degrades the transmission performance. Recently, we proposed a frequency-domain adaptive interference cancellation (FDAIC) technique to mitigate the residual ICI and showed that the full code multiplexed MC-CDMA with FDAIC achieves better performance than orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However, the impact of spreading factor was not discussed. In this paper, we evaluate, by computer simulation, the average BER and throughput performances of turbo-coded MC-CDMA with FDAIC for different values of spreading factor, and show that the full-code multiplexed MC-CDMA with FDAIC using the full spreading factor (equal to the number of subcarriers) can provide almost the same or better transmission performance than OFDM.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773762.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of spreading factor on turbo-coded multi-code MC-CDMA using ICI cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of spreading factor on turbo-coded multi-code MC-CDMA using ICI cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773762/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444869","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of spreading factor on turbo-coded multi-code MC-CDMA using ICI cancellation","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047155S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773764,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Zhou","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38187413300"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773764","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","AWGN","Additive white noise","Concatenated codes","Sorting","Mobile communication","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","oscillations","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented belief propagation","ABP decoding based oscillation","node selection method","low-density parity check code","LDPC code","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel","parallel decoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"The augmented belief propagation (ABP) decoding using previous node selection methods for low-density parity check (LDPC) codes with a large number of short cycles is investigated on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in this paper.

OFDM, however, has a problem with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) that strictly limits its application. Recently, OFDM combined with time division multiplexing (TDM) using minimum mean square error frequency domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) was proposed to improve the transmission performance of conventional OFDM in terms of the bit error rate (BER) while reducing the PAPR. In this paper, we theoretically analyze and discuss the trade-off for OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE between the channel capacity and the PAPR in a nonlinear and frequency-selective fading channel. Our results show that OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE achieves a larger capacity with a lower PAPR in comparison with the conventional OFDM. It is also shown that the channel capacity of OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE is bounded between the conventional OFDM and single-carrier (SC) transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity of OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE in a nonlinear and frequency-selective fading channel","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On capacity of OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE in a nonlinear and frequency-selective fading channel","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773777/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10429129","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity of OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE in a nonlinear and frequency-selective fading channel","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041976S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773782,"authors":[{"name":"Constantin Siriteanu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Siriteanu","id":"37266690200"},{"name":"Xin Guan","affiliation":["Masters student in the Digital Communications Laboratory, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Guan","id":"38187992100"},{"name":"Steven D.

Therefore, the principles of BF and MRC have been integrated to forge maximal-ratio eigencombining (MREC), which promises to reap the available array and diversity gains more effectively. Nonetheless, the relative performance and numerical complexity of MREC, BF, and MRC have not yet been investigated for channel estimated from received-signal-vector samples in a TU uplink scenario with realistic Laplacian base-station power azimuth spectrum and log-normally distributed AS with exponential temporal correlation. Therefore, herein, Yangpsilas effective and low-complexity deflation-based projection approximation subspace tracking (PASTd) algorithm is deployed to recursively update the channel eigenstructure required for MREC adapted to AS using the classical bias-variance tradeoff criterion (BVTC).

The identifiability condition is very simple. The design of the precoding sequence which minimizes the noise effect and numerical error in covariance matrix estimation is proposed. Simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773788.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation for single carrier block transmission systems with frequency domain equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Frequency domain analysis","Covariance matrix","Vectors","OFDM","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","channel coding","channel estimation","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","frequency-domain analysis","Hermitian matrices","precoding","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","single carrier block transmission system","frequency domain equalization","periodic precoding scheme","channel impulse response estimation","channel product matrix","linear equations","eigenvalue-eigenvector","Hermitian matrix","covariance matrix estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single carrier","frequency domain equalization","blind estimation","periodic precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation for single carrier block transmission systems with frequency domain equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773788/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773788/","accessionNumber":"10468677","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation for single carrier block transmission systems with frequency domain equalization","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042489S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773795,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Since a single common boundary between access and relay links is employed for the system, some access link associated with an individual RS can be either overloaded or under-loaded when traffic load is non-uniformly distributed, which causes an inefficient resource allocation. This paper proposes a load-balancing opportunistic (LoBO) scheduling algorithm that improves the overall system throughput in a weighted proportional fairness manner while balancing the traffic load over the access link to be shared by all RSpsilas. The proposed algorithm dynamically determines the common access-to-relay interval boundary as a part of packet scheduling, which has been shown to outperform the conventional system in which the boundary selection and packet scheduling are implemented as the separate processes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic packet scheduling algorithm for load balancing in a multi-hop relay-enhanced cellular OFDMA-TDD System","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773818.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic packet scheduling algorithm for load balancing in a multi-hop relay-enhanced cellular OFDMA-TDD System","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773818/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468698","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic packet scheduling algorithm for load balancing in a multi-hop relay-enhanced cellular OFDMA-TDD System","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054505S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4773819,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Ming Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Ming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37694680200"},{"name":"Chien-Feng Lo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Feng","lastName":"Lo","id":"38186978100"},{"name":"Yunghsiang S.

The larger free distance a VLECC has, the more redundancy the VLECC suffers from. The redundancy can be used to combat the channel noise effectively by using the technique of joint source-channel decoding (JSCD). However, for larger VLECCs, the high computational decoding complexity has prevented these codes from implementation in practice. In this work, a new bit metric with low computational complexity is derived first, then based on a code trellis rather than on a code tree, we proposed a maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-level soft-decision sequential decoding algorithm and its two approximations. Simulation results indicate that both approximations can provide nearly the same performance as the MAP scheme while exhibiting a significantly lower complexity.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bit- and trellis- based soft-decision sequential decoding for variable-length error-correcting codes","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468699","htmlLink":"/document/4773819/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit- and trellis- based soft-decision sequential decoding for variable-length error-correcting codes","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065573S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773820,"authors":[{"name":"Michael McGuire","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"McGuire","id":"37433706100"},{"name":"Mihai Sima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Sima","id":"37294937000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773820","dbTime":"62 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Iterative algorithms","Detection algorithms","Frequency diversity","Robustness","Communication channels","Matched filters","Degradation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","fixed point arithmetic","iterative methods","matched filters","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-spread OFDM","frequency diversity","communication channel state","matched filter","iterative sup-optimal detection algorithm","intrinsic data-level parallelism","fast fading condition","parallel detectors","block interference","computational complexity","BER performance","fixed-point arithmetic","embedded systems"]}],"abstract":"The block-spreading technique allows OFDM-based communications systems to exploit frequency diversity. Previous detection algorithms for block-spread OFDM (BSOFDM) are not robust to fast fading, when the communications channel state changes significantly during an OFDM symbol period. It is demonstrated through the use of a new matched filter bound that the performance degradation under fast fading of these algorithms is caused by limitations of the decoding algorithms, and is not an inherent limitation of BSOFDM. An iterative algorithm is introduced with intrinsic data-level parallelism for detecting BSOFDM in the presence of fast fading. Detection is first performed independently on sub-blocks of the received symbol vector. Information is exchanged between these parallel detectors in an iterative manner by estimating the interference between the blocks and removing it from the signal vector. It is shown that the computational complexity of this algorithm is not significantly higher than the detection algorithms for BSOFDM over stationary channels, and achieves excellent BER for fast fading with fixed-point arithmetic, making it suitable for use on embedded systems.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773820.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of block-spread OFDM in fast fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of block-spread OFDM in fast fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773820/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468700","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773820/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of block-spread OFDM in fast fading","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074197S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773821,"authors":[{"name":"Eu-Suk Shim","lastName":"Eu-Suk Shim","id":"37542813200"},{"name":"Hyun Yang","lastName":"Hyun Yang","id":"37694109200"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","lastName":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","id":"37270117500"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","lastName":"Young-Hwan You","id":"37269122600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773821","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"Cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is a simple transmit diversity technique for coded OFDM systems with multiple transmit antennas.

If any wrong CIR is chosen to obtain the CFR, a significant estimation error floor will appear despite of no ISI.

Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the CEC method of the conventional FPTP algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved channel impulse response estimation for OFDM system with virtual subcarriers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Time domain analysis","Estimation error","Frequency estimation","Digital video broadcasting","Digital audio broadcasting","Partial transmit sequences","Wireless LAN","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","time-frequency analysis","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel impulse response estimation","OFDM system","virtual subcarriers","band-limitation effect","modified pilot sequence method","frequency-domain pilot algorithm","time-domain processing algorithm","FPTP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Channel Estimation","Virtual Subcarriers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An improved channel impulse response estimation for OFDM system with virtual subcarriers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773835/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468712","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved channel impulse response estimation for OFDM system with virtual subcarriers","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07123S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4773836,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

Estimation of the unknown function is implemented with support vector regression (SVR). The output of SVR will be used by WCDMA mobile network to decide on new service admission. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then applied to form optimal beams to cover all UEs in a cell with minimum power. This artificial intelligent call admission control (CAC) was validated using a dynamic WCDMA mobile network simulator. A few comparative results in downlink have shown that our integrated support vector regression assists genetic algorithm (SVRaGA) is capable of predicting next interval power consumption at Node B with low prediction error and improving the quality of service (QoS) by reducing dropped calls.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773836.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial intelligent power prediction for efficient resource management of WCDMA mobile network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773836/","displayDocTitle":"Artificial intelligent power prediction for efficient resource management of WCDMA mobile network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10468713","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4773836/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial intelligent power prediction for efficient resource management of WCDMA mobile network","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048977S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4773837,"authors":[{"name":"Jyun-Sheng Wang","lastName":"Jyun-Sheng Wang","id":"38191152200"},{"name":"Jenn-Kaie Lain","lastName":"Jenn-Kaie Lain","id":"37541868700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773837","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"abstract":"A genetical swarm optimization (GSO)-based detector using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing signaling is proposed.

In this paper, we consider signal transmission in downlink of cooperative cellular direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. In this case, signal is transmitted to the destination mobile terminals via direct links, i.e. links from the base station to users, and also from a cooperative link via the partner mobile terminal to the destination. Our purpose is to shift the spatial processing from the user terminal to the transmitter of the base station. We proposed two different precoding schemes. In the first scheme, we assume that the inter-user channel state information is available at the relay mobile terminals and the base station only has information about the direct links. In the second scheme, we assume that all direct and inter-user channel state information are available at the base station. We derive different linear precoding techniques for two schemes and evaluate their performance by computer simulations. We show that both proposed cooperation schemes improve the performance of the system with respect to the case when no cooperation is used in the system. In addition it will be shown that the proposed schemes can achieve maximum diversity with low complexity requirements at the mobile receivers.","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773839.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative diversity in downlink of cellular CDMA systems using maximum ratio precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative diversity in downlink of cellular CDMA systems using maximum ratio precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773839/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444874","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4773839/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative diversity in downlink of cellular CDMA systems using maximum ratio precoding","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064608S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4773842,"authors":[{"name":"Haixia Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Haixia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280795800"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Feng Zhao","id":"37276958100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88552-231-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"4773842","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the channel estimation error on the array processing based decoder for QO-STBC","abstract":"An array processing based decoder for the quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (QO-STBC) has been analyzed in our former work. It is investigated in terms of complexity and symbol error ratio (SER) under the assumption that perfect channel state information (CSI) is known to the receiver. As in wireless communication scenarios, it is prohibitive to get the perfect knowledge of channel. So it is worth to investigate how the array processing based decoder will be effected by imperfect CSI. In this work, the impact caused by channel estimation error on the performance of the QO-STBC is evaluated. Based on the analysis and simulation results, we can see that the channel estimation error does degrade the SER performance a lot in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime. Mean square error (MSE) is employed to measure how the degradation depends on the correctness of the estimator. To make this method applicable, channel estimators should be probably chosen.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768556/4773649/04773842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773649","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4773842","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Array signal processing","Decoding","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Block codes","Channel state information","Wireless communication","Signal analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","block codes","channel estimation","error statistics","mean square error methods","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation error","symbol error ratio","array processing","quasi-orthogonal space-time block code","channel state information","wireless communication","mean square error method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quasi-orthogonal space-time block code","channel state information","mean square error null space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4773842/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of the channel estimation error on the array processing based decoder for QO-STBC","accessionNumber":"10468717","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4773842/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the channel estimation error on the array processing based decoder for QO-STBC","confLoc":"Akihabara, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050105S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768556","isNumber":"4773649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768556","xplore-issue":"4773649","articleId":"4773842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICEIEICE Institute of Electronics Informati","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774000,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xiao-ming","affiliation":["Jiangxi Electric Power Corporation, Nangchang, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xiao-ming","id":"38271061000"},{"name":"Liu-Xiaobo","affiliation":["Jiangxi Electric Power Corporation, Nangchang, China"],"lastName":"Liu-Xiaobo","id":"37087602221"},{"name":"Lu-Yongping","affiliation":["Jiangxi Electric Power Corporation, Nangchang, China"],"lastName":"Lu-Yongping","id":"37087282834"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2809-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2810-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4774000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Dissolved gas analysis","Power transformers","Fault diagnosis","Power transformer insulation","Neurons","Oil insulation","Counting circuits","Power system security","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault diagnosis","neural nets","power transformer testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["counter propagation arithmetic","CP modular neural networks","power transformer fault diagnosis","diagnosis correctness","backpropagation","dissolved gases analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transformer","Fault diagnosis","Dissolved Gases Analysis (DGA)","CP compound neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774000","abstract":"Counter propagation arithmetic is make up of this paper presents a fault diagnosis model for power transformer based on counter propagation network.

The partial discharge source localization by ultrasonic measuring in a power transformer is studied by the particle swarm optimization, and the signal parameter estimated model of ultrasonic localization has been established based on the propagation properties of the ultrasonic wave. Experiment results have shown that PSO algorithm possesses high calculation efficiency and high convergence speed, and can efficiently prevent the result from falling into the localized optimum.","doi":"10.1109/ICHVE.2008.4774007","startPage":"600","endPage":"603","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753969/4773853/04774007.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHVE.2008.4774007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Partial Discharge Localization by Ultrasonic Measuring in Power Transformer Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Partial discharge measurement","Power measurement","Particle measurements","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Power transformers","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulation testing","partial discharge measurement","particle swarm optimisation","power transformer insulation","power transformer testing","ultrasonic materials testing","ultrasonic measurement","ultrasonic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge source localization","ultrasonic measurement","power transformer","particle swarm optimization","PSO algorithm","random searching algorithm","continuous function optimization","signal parameter estimation model","ultrasonic localization","ultrasonic wave propagation properties","insulation testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power transformer","ultrasonic localization","partial discharge","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Study on Partial Discharge Localization by Ultrasonic Measuring in Power Transformer Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444813","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Partial Discharge Localization by Ultrasonic Measuring in Power Transformer Based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"ICHVE-00-154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062423S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753969","isNumber":"4773853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753969","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4773853","articleId":"4774007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4774012,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Tae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Daejin University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600799400"},{"name":"Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Daejin University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37657490300"},{"name":"Sung-Kwun Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","id":"37291814100"},{"name":"Keon-Jun Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Keon-Jun","lastName":"Park","id":"37657326600"},{"name":"Gil-Sung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gil-Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38189405200"},{"name":"Stanislaw Grzybowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Grzybowski","id":"37267117800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2809-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2810-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3823-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4774012","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774012","abstract":"In order to develop reliable on-site partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition algorithm, the fuzzy inference-based polynomial network pattern classifier (PNC), one of the fuzzy-neural networks, was investigated.

For the control and protection devices, it is necessary to estimate in real-time parameters of the basic waveforms. Various digital algorithms have been developed for real-time estimation of the phasors of fundamental components. The most known methods are basing on the Fourier technique. By on-line estimation the phasors of the currents and voltages main component do not rotate under stationary conditions. When using Fourier algorithms under transient conditions the estimated phasors change their positions. However, the trajectories of the estimated parameters are not monotonous. The estimated phasors can be applied to calculating the impedance of a faulted transmission line, for protection devices. To predict the desired parameters of a protected line under transient conditions we need a monotonous behaviour of the transient response of algorithms for impedance calculating. Different wavelets have been investigated. In this paper some investigation results of the complex Morlet wavelet are shown. On the basis of extensive investigations, using Morlet wavelet with the scale coefficient a = 0.01 for the both current and voltage filtering is proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location of Faults on Transmission Lines Using Wavelet Transforms","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application","doi":"10.1109/ICHVE.2008.4774015","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4753969/4773853/04774015.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHVE.2008.4774015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Location of Faults on Transmission Lines Using Wavelet Transforms","conferenceDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774015/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10459282","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location of Faults on Transmission Lines Using Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"ICHVE-00-162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042161S","chronDate":"9-12 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4753969","isNumber":"4773853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4753969","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4773853","articleId":"4774015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4774023,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wei-gen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Weigen Chen was born in Zhejiang, China, 1967.

There have been several methods for transformer fault synthetic diagnosis, but each of them has its own limitations in real fault diagnosis applications. In order to overcome those shortcomings in the existing methods, a new transformer fault diagnosis method based on a wavelet neural network optimized by adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and an improved D-S evidence theory fusion technique is proposed in this paper. The proposed method combines the oil chromatogram data and the off-line electrical test data of transformers to carry out fault diagnosis. Based on the fusion mechanism of D-S evidence theory, the comprehensive reliability of evidence is constructed by considering the evidence importance, the outputs of the neural network and the expert experience. The new method increases the objectivity of the basic probability assignment (BPA) and reduces the basic probability assigned for uncertain and unimportant information.

In addressing the problem, it is critical for commercial suppliers of system solutions for mobile phones to understand exactly what gains can be achieved by the various options available before investing time, money and resources. This paper presents a comprehensive system analysis of the total efficiency gains achievable in the RF parts of a multimode transmitter that arise from adding a hybrid modulator between the battery and supply terminal of the power amplifier (PA). Behavioral modeling is used to simulate the modulator, the PA and the combination of the two under various envelope-tracking and polar-modulation regimes. The results are supported by measured data. They indicate that PA efficiency for EDGE and UMTS modes can be improved by as much as 20%, although this is easily negated by losses in the modulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.927013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4774051/04774068.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"279","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.927013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-Efficiency Analysis of Power Amplifier Supply-Tracking Regimes in Mobile Transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"System-Efficiency Analysis of Power Amplifier Supply-Tracking Regimes in Mobile Transmitters","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4774068/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470344","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-Efficiency Analysis of Power Amplifier Supply-Tracking Regimes in Mobile Transmitters","sourcePdf":"56tcsi01-minnis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062611S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4774051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4774051","articleId":"4774068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4774072,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Razavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4774051/4774072/4774072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behzad Razavi (F'03) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1985 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D.E.E. degrees from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1988 and 1992, respectively.","He was with AT&T Bell Laboratories and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories until 1996.

The main differences between these two devices are the scintillators and the achievable frame rate. Both devices have been tested in terms of system linearity, sensitivity, resolution, stability and noise properties, taking into account the different timing schemes for each one of them and the mandatory corrections on the raw data. Tomographic scans have been carried out using both detectors to evaluate its final performance as well as the delivered dose needed to achieve similar quality scans. An experimental cone-beam CT test-bench has been designed and implemented to perform the different measurements. It uses a micro-focus X-ray source and a rotating stage where the samples are placed. A modified FDK algorithm has been used to reconstruct the acquired data. Both detectors show similar results for pixel linearity and stability measurements, and their noise levels are comparable. The resolution and sensitivity features are better for the direct grown scintillator detector (9 lpmm vs. 6 lpmm, and \u223c4 times more sensitive for similar delivered dose). Since tomographic reconstructed images for the higher frame-rate detector show acceptable quality, it can be used to implement a faster system for high-speed acquisition techniques like, for example, dynamic imaging or gated protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774118/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774118/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of two flat-panel X-ray detectors applied to small-animal imaging cone-beam micro-CT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of two flat-panel X-ray detectors applied to small-animal imaging cone-beam micro-CT","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125407S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774179,"authors":[{"name":"B.

inpainting method is proposed for metal artifact reduction in medical computed tomography (CT). Digital inpainting is an image processing method to fill in the lost image information in a consistent way. In our work, projection data with metal projection region (MPR) are treated as a damaged image, and TV inpainting is applied to \u201cinpaint\u201d the information missing region. Compared to conventional interpolation methods, the advantage of our algorithm lies in dealing with complicate cases such as an image with multiple metal objects. In numerical experiments, both TV inpainting and linear interpolation method are performed on noise-free and additive noisy projection of a modified Shepp-Logan phantom. Results show that the algorithm proposed fills metal projection gaps more smoothly and accurately than linear interpolation, hence produces images of superior quality after reconstruction. Relevant practical issues including the limitation of the algorithm and possible improvements for future work are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4774201/","displayDocTitle":"Metal artifact reduction in CT images by sinogram TV inpainting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metal artifact reduction in CT images by sinogram TV inpainting","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039621S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4774231,"authors":[{"name":"Josep F.

The energy and location information are processed using an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter that samples an analog value that is proportional to the integral of the charge created by the scintillation event. We propose to change the paradigm and modulate the width (rather than amplitude) of a digital pulse to be proportional to the integral of the charge created. The analog value of the outgoing digital pulses is recovered by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) in the back-end electronics, without the need for an ADC. Note that in this new scenario the same TDC used to record the time of the event is used to recover the amplitude. The main performance parameter that must be optimized is the dynamic range versus the dead-time of the front-end detector. The goal is an 8-bit dynamic range for this pulse-width modulation (PWM) scheme, which is adequate for high resolution PET systems based on semiconductor detectors such as avalanche photodiodes (APD) or cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). A novel circuit has been designed, fabricated, and tested for the proposed PWM readout scheme. This circuit is different than previously developed time over threshold pulse width modulation circuits used in high energy physics. PWM techniques simplify the routing to the back end electronics without degrading the performance of the system. A readout architecture based on PWM processes digital rather than analog pulses, which can be easily multiplexed, enabling one to achieve very high channel density required for ultra-high resolution, 3-D positioning PET detector systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse width modulation: A novel readout scheme for high energy photon detection","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774297","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747668/4774073/04774297.pdf","startPage":"4530","endPage":"4535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pulse width modulation: A novel readout scheme for high energy photon detection","conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774297/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse width modulation: A novel readout scheme for high energy photon detection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100766S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774299,"authors":[{"name":"Andy T.

Current clinical systems based on LYSO have timing resolutions near 600ps (FWHM), but considerably better resolution is possible with faster scintillators. We have previously reported results for a prototype TOF-PET scanner using LaBr3 (5% Ce) as the scintillation crystal. These preliminary results were obtained using a \u201clocal\u201d triggering electronics scheme, in which the seven PMTs used for energy and positioning measurements are also used to produce a trigger. The local triggering design is intended to reduce the effects of pulse pileup and noise, reducing deterioration of the timing resolution at high count rates, and allowing us to take full advantage of the timing properties of LaBr\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf>\n.

However, the high noise during data acquisition (and therefore degraded image quality) impairs diagnostic accuracy. This work explores a multiscale approach to reduce non-stationary Gaussian noise in low-dose CT sinograms by wavelet analysis. To explore the noise property in wavelet domain, statistical analysis on the distribution of wavelet coefficients was performed with different basic functions, using computer simulation. A stationary wavelet transform was chosen to alleviate the Gibbs ringing effect caused by thresholding process with orthogonal basic functions. A Bayesian analysis was applied to estimate the local variance at each decomposed scale so that noise reduction on the wavelet coefficients becomes adaptive to each scale. Both computer simulations and phantom experiments were performed to show the potential of the presented local-adaptive stationary wavelet transform for low-dose CT. Comparing with traditional smoothing filters and wavelet-based thresholding denoising methods, the proposed method demonstrated noticeable improvement on noise reduction and edge preservation of low-dose CT images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747668/4774073/04774439.pdf","startPage":"5339","endPage":"5344","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Noise Reduction on Low-Dose CT Sinogram by Stationary Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Wavelet transforms","Computed tomography","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet coefficients","Computer simulation","Protocols","Data acquisition","Degradation","Image quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Noise Reduction on Low-Dose CT Sinogram by Stationary Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774439/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Noise Reduction on Low-Dose CT Sinogram by Stationary Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056429S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774444,"authors":[{"name":"Peter D.

The electro-optical coupling consists of a magnetically insensitive photodetector connected to a non-magnetic vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) diode. This scheme essentially acts as an optical wire. When compared to signal transmission over standard co-axial cables, electro-optical coupling will have little influence on a MR system because the optical fibers are not conductive. A single 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 20 mm LYSO crystal coupled to a SENSL SPMArray 3035G16 was placed in coincidence with a 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm LSO crystal coupled to a R9779-20 Hamamatsu PMT with and without non-magnetic VCSEL laser coupling. No change was measured in energy resolution of 15.6 +/\u2212 0.4 % with electro-optical coupling versus coax-coupling energy resolution 15.5 +/\u2212 0.4%. Also, no change in coincidence time resolution was measured between electro-optical coupling with 1.30 +/\u2212 0.01 ns FWHM versus coax at 1.32 +/\u2212 0.02 ns FWHM. High speed analog modulation using the VCSEL laser was successful and paves the way for a MR compatible PET block detector that has a significantly reduced electronic footprint than a standard MR compatible PET detector. This may provide the way to create a large axial FOV whole body clinical PET system that will have very little influence on a whole body clinical MR system performance.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774444","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747668/4774073/04774444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774073","startPage":"4640","endPage":"4645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel electro-optically coupled MR-compatible PET detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4774444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel electro-optically coupled MR-compatible PET detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774444/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4774444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel electro-optically coupled MR-compatible PET detectors","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061169S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774479,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, fully digital DAQ systems working in free-running sampling mode with conversion rates \u226a 100 MHz have to rely on interpolation or model fitting techniques in order to achieve a tight coincidence window. This paper presents a simple but accurate method for on-line timestamp extraction in PET detectors. The proposed algorithm is based on a simple bipolar shaping using digital delays and a subsequent zero-crossing detection by linear interpolation. It can be easily integrated in an FPGA and it operates synchronously with the data processing chain. Experimental results show that this method produces a gaussian time difference spectrum with good timing resolution of \u03c3 = 2.20 ns (5.17 ns FWHM) obtained with a fairly moderate conversion rate of 40 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774723","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1667","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/4747668/4774073/04774723.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital delay line shaping-zero crossing algorithm for timestamp extraction in PET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital delay line shaping-zero crossing algorithm for timestamp extraction in PET","conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4774723/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4774723/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital delay line shaping-zero crossing algorithm for timestamp extraction in PET","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-00650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045908S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4774723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4774801,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Possible applications will strongly depend on a successful implementation of on-chip hit recognition and sparsification schemes. For this aim, a 5 bit very low power and low level signal analog to digital converter (ADC) using a double sampling switched capacitor technique has been implemented in 0.35\u00b5m CMOS technology. A non-resetting sample and hold stage is integrated. This first stage compensates both the amplifier offset effect and the input common mode voltage fluctuations. The converter is composed of three successive 1.5 bit pipeline stages followed by a 2 bit flash stage. The prototype consists of 16 ADC double-channels; each one is sampling at 50 MS/s and dissipates only 1.38 mW at 2 V supply voltage. A bias pulsing stage is integrated in the circuit. Therefore, the analog part is switched OFF or ON in less than 1 \u00b5s. The size of the ADC is 80 \u00b5m \u00d7 1.4 mm.

The X-ray Pump Probe (XPP) instrument, for which the ASIC has been designed, requires a large input dynamic range on the order of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n photons at 8 keV with a resolution of half a photon FWHM. Due to the size of the pixel and the length of the readout line, large input capacitance is expected, leading to stringent requirement on the noise optimization. Furthermore, the large number of pixels needed for a good position resolution and the fixed LCLS beam period impose limitations on the time available for the single pixel readout. Considering the periodic nature of the LCLS beam, the ASIC developed for this application is a time-variant system providing low-noise charge integration, filtering and correlated double sampling. In order to cope with the large input dynamic range a charge pump scheme implementing a zero-balance measurement method has been introduced. It provides an on chip 3-bit coarse digital conversion of the integrated charge. The residual charge is sampled using correlated double sampling into analog memory and measured with the required resolution.

(1) The bin widths are uneven and depend on temperature and power supply voltage, which must be calibrated as frequently as possible. The auto-calibration functional block developed in this work provides semi-continuous calibration that converts the TDC measurements from bins to picoseconds. (2) In many applications, the TDC resolution is limited by the \u201cultra-wide bins\u201d, corresponding to the carry chain crossing at the boundaries of the logic array blocks. The apparent widths of these ultra-wide bins can be several times bigger than the average bin width. The \u201cwave union launchers\u201d described in this paper are designed to make multiple measurements with a single delay chain structure, effectively to sub-divide the ultra-wide bins in each raw measurement.

SiPM-based scintillation detectors can exhibit inherent nonlinearity, which may result in a degradation of the energy and position resolution. One cause of nonlinearity is saturation, which depends on the ratio between the total number of GM APDs that compose the device and the average number of photoelectrons created within the active volume of the SiPM during the recovery time of the cells. A second cause becomes apparent if we investigate the simultaneous firing of multiple cells. We show by means of Spice simulations that the output impedance of a SiPM changes with the number of fired cells. This introduces nonlinearity in the measured signal if the input impedance of subsequent front-end electronics is not negligible. To tackle this problem we present a new SiPM preamplifier design for SiPM based TOF PET scintillation detectors. A compact 16-channel front-end board for read-out of position-sensitive SiPM arrays has been built, based on this preamplifier concept. Our simulations and measurements show (i) excellent linearity, (ii) sufficiently low noise (\u223c85 fC referred to input) and (iii) outstanding low timing jitter (\u223c17 ps FWHM coincidence response of two SiPM\u2019s excited by a laser pulse).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4775107/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high bandwidth preamplifier for SiPM-based TOF PET scintillation detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high bandwidth preamplifier for SiPM-based TOF PET scintillation detectors","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01302009-01034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050539S","chronDate":"19-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4747668","isNumber":"4774073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4747668","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4774073","articleId":"4775107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4775174,"authors":[{"name":"Victoria B.

Quantitative measurement is more suitable than qualitative measurement (i.e., mapping with a relative scale) of tissue viscoelasticity for diagnosis of diffuse diseases where abnormality is not confined to a local region and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV) uses shear wave propagation speed measured in tissue at multiple frequencies (typically in the range of hundreds of Hertz) to solve quantitatively for both tissue elasticity and viscosity. A shear wave is stimulated within the tissue by an ultrasound push beam and monitored by a separate ultrasound detect beam. The phase difference of the shear wave between 2 locations along its propagation path is used to calculate shear wave speed within the tissue. In vitro SDUV measurements along and across bovine striated muscle fibers show results of tissue elasticity and viscosity close to literature values. An intermittent pulse sequence is developed to allow one array transducer for both push and detect function. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDUV measurements in swine liver using a dual transducer prototype simulating the operation of a single array transducer.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1005","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4775250/04775264.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV) for measuring tissue elasticity and viscosity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775264/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV) for measuring tissue elasticity and viscosity","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4775264/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10471743","pubMedId":"19213632","publicationDate":"January 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV) for measuring tissue elasticity and viscosity","sourcePdf":"t0910055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066107S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4775250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"348","xplore-issue":"4775250","articleId":"4775264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":4775266,"authors":[{"name":"Drake A.

Although the beamplot, contrast resolution metrics, SNR measurements, ideal observer methods, and contrast-detail analysis provide useful information, it remains difficult to discern how changes in system parameters affect these metrics and clinical imaging performance. In this paper, we present a rigorous methodology for characterizing the pulse-echo imaging performance of arbitrary ultrasound systems. Our metric incorporates the 4-D spatio-temporal system response, which is defined as a function of the individual beamformer channel weights. The metric also incorporates the individual beamformer channel electronic SNR. Whereas earlier performance measures dealt solely with contrast resolution or echo signal-to-noise ratio, our metric combines them so that tradeoffs between these parameters are easily distinguishable. The new metric quantifies an arbitrary system's contrast resolution and SNR performance as a function of cyst size, beamformer channel weights, and beamformer channel SNR. We present a theoretical derivation of the unified performance metric and provide simulation and experimental results highlighting the metric's utility. We compare the fundamental performance limits of 2 beamforming strategies: the dynamic focus finite impulse response (FIR) filter beamformer and the spatial matched filter (SMF) beamformer to the performance of the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. Results from this study show that the SMF beamformer and the FIR beamformer offer significant gains in beamformer SNR and contrast resolution compared with the DAS beamformer, respectively. The metric clearly distinguishes the performance of the SMF beamformer, which enhances system sensitivity, from the FIR beamformer, which optimizes system contrast resolution. Finally, the metric provides one quantitative goal for optimizing a broadband beamformer's contrast resolution performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","volume":"56","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10478500","pubMedId":"19213634","publicationDate":"January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4775266/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized cystic resolution: a metric for assessing the fundamental limits on beamformer performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized cystic resolution: a metric for assessing the fundamental limits on beamformer performance","sourcePdf":"t0910077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071266S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4775250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4775250","articleId":"4775266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4775268,"authors":[{"name":"F.-J Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/4775250/4775268/4775268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Faa-Jeng Lin (M'93-SM'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1983, 1985, and 1993, respectively.

Traditional LDA-based methods suffer a fundamental limitation originating from the parametric nature of scatter matrices, which are based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. The performance of these methods notably degrades when the actual distribution is Non-Gaussian. To address this problem, we propose a new formulation of scatter matrices to extend the two-class nonparametric discriminant analysis to multi-class cases. Then, we develop two more improved multi-class NDA-based algorithms (NSA and NFA) with each one having two complementary methods based on the principal space and the null space of the intra-class scatter matrix respectively. Comparing to the NSA, the NFA is more effective in the utilization of the classification boundary information. In order to exploit the complementary nature of the two kinds of NFA (PNFA and NNFA), we finally develop a dual NFA-based multi-classifier fusion framework by employing the over complete Gabor representation to boost the recognition performance. We show the improvements of the developed new algorithms over the traditional subspace methods through comparative experiments on two challenging face databases, Purdue AR database and XM2VTS database.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4785439/04775283.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785439","startPage":"755","endPage":"761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4775283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10476227","pubMedId":"19229090","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4775283/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2009040755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063926S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4785439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4785439","articleId":"4775283","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4775330,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Akrad","affiliation":["LGEP/SPEE Labs; CNRS UMR8507, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Akrad"},{"name":"Mickael Hilairet","affiliation":["LGEP/SPEE Labs; CNRS UMR8507, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mickael","lastName":"Hilairet"},{"name":"Romeo Ortega","affiliation":["L2S, Supelec; CNRS UMR8506, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Romeo","lastName":"Ortega"},{"name":"Demba Diallo","affiliation":["LGEP/SPEE Labs; CNRS UMR8507, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Demba","lastName":"Diallo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-86341-809-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0537-9989"}],"articleNumber":"4775330","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","energy-shaping","port-controlled Hamiltonian systems","IDA-PBC methodology","non linear observer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4775330","doi":"10.1049/ic:20070036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic:20070036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775319","publicationTitle":"2007 IET Colloquium on Reliability in Electromagnetic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IET Colloquium on Reliability in Electromagnetic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768593/4775319/04775330.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnection and Damping Assignment approach for reliable PM synchronous motor control","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to design a high performance speed controller for a PMSM drive.

This variation in tasks requirements as well as machine capabilities has created a very strong need for developing mapping techniques to decide on which task should be moved to where and when, to optimize some system performance criteria. The existing dynamic heuristics for mapping tasks in HC systems works either on-line (immediate) or in batch mode. In batch mode, tasks are collected into a set that is examined for mapping at prescheduled times called mapping events. On contrast, on-line mode algorithms map a task onto a machine as soon as it arrives at the mapper. In this paper, we propose an on-line mapping algorithm which is called the maximum load balance, or for short the MLB. It tries to minimize the makespan by maximizing the load balancing of the target system. At each task arrival, the MLB algorithm examines all the machines in the HC suite one by one looking for the one that gives the maximum system balance among all possible mappings. In contrast with the opportunistic load balancing (OLB) heuristic; which assigns a task to the machine that becomes ready next, the MLB takes into consideration both the availability of the machine as well as the execution time of the task on that machine.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775659","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762293/4775633/04775659.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic On-Line Allocation of Independent Task onto Heterogeneous Computing Systems to Maximize Load Balancing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic On-Line Allocation of Independent Task onto Heterogeneous Computing Systems to Maximize Load Balancing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460241","htmlLink":"/document/4775659/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic On-Line Allocation of Independent Task onto Heterogeneous Computing Systems to Maximize Load Balancing","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042053S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4762293","isNumber":"4775633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762293","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4775633","articleId":"4775659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4775660,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is a very well known measure of the envelope fluctuations and has become the cost function used to evaluate and design OFDM systems. In this paper, we propose a PAPR reduction scheme known as adding signal method for which the principle is to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signals by adding several artificial signals. It is an extension of the method that we have proposed in. The major advantages of this technique include downward compatibility, no performance degradation and no transmission of side information. A method is said to be downward compatibility if its implementation in a transmitter does not imply modifications in the associated receiver. According to simulation results, the method outperforms the PAPR-reduction performance presented.

The error summary for operands ranging from 8-bits to 16-bits operands indicates very low error percentage with only two parallel correction circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775704","startPage":"303","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762293/4775633/04775704.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775704","endPage":"308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Mitchell's Algorithm Based Multiplier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Mitchell's Algorithm Based Multiplier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4775704/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10470732","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Mitchell's Algorithm Based Multiplier","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057214S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4762293","isNumber":"4775633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4775633","articleId":"4775704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4775722,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo Reis","affiliation":["School of Technology and Management, University of Extremadura, University of Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Reis","id":"38118633200"},{"name":"Nuno Fonseca","affiliation":["Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Fonseca","id":"37891285800"},{"name":"Francisco Fernandez","affiliation":["fcofdez@unex.es"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Fernandez","id":"37064933100"},{"name":"Anibal Ferreira","affiliation":["ajf@fe.up.pt"],"firstName":"Anibal","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37399642000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3554-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3555-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"4775722","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4775722","abstract":"This paper presents a genetic algorithm approach with harmonic structure evolution for polyphonic music transcription. Automatic music transcription is a very complex problem that continues waiting for solutions due to the harmonic complexity of musical sounds. More traditional approaches try to extract the information directly from the audio stream, but by taking into account that a polyphonic audio stream is no more than a combination of several musical notes, music transcription can be addressed as a search space problem where the goal is to find the sequence of notes that best models our audio signal. By taking advantage of the genetic algorithms to explore large search spaces we present a new approach to the music transcription problem. In order to reduce the harmonic overfitting several techniques were used including the encoding of the harmonic structure of the internal synthesizer inside the individual's genotype as a way to evolve towards the instrument played on the original audio signal. The results obtained in polyphonic piano transcriptions show the feasibility of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775722","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762293/4775633/04775722.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Approach with Harmonic Structure Evolution for Polyphonic Music Transcription","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Music","Multiple signal classification","Instruments","Synthesizers","Data mining","Frequency","Bayesian methods","Streaming media","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","audio signal processing","genetic algorithms","music","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphonic music transcription","harmonic structure evolution","genetic algorithm","harmonic complexity","polyphonic audio stream","search space problem","audio signal","acoustic signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Music Transcription","Genetic Algorithms","Harmonic Overfitting","Harmonic Structure Evolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Approach with Harmonic Structure Evolution for Polyphonic Music Transcription","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4775722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10460259","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Approach with Harmonic Structure Evolution for Polyphonic Music Transcription","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054265S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4762293","isNumber":"4775633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762293","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4775633","articleId":"4775722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4775731,"authors":[{"name":"S.

AMR offers substantial improvement over previous GSM speech codecs in error robustness by adapting speech and channel coding depending on channel conditions. The Adaptive Multi-Rate speech codec is adopted as a standard for IMT-2000 by ETSI and 3GPP and consists of eight source codecs with bit rates from 4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s. In this paper, we present an approach comprising of particle swarm optimization (PSO), which encodes possible segmentations of an audio record, and measures mutual information between these segments and the audio data. This measure is used as the fitness function for the PSO. A compact encoding of the solution for PSO which decreases the length of the PSO individuals and enhances the PSO convergence properties is adopted. The algorithm has been tested on two actual sets of data with AMR format for speaker segmentation, obtaining very good results in all test problems. The results have been compared to the widely used a genetic algorithm-based in several practical situations. No assumptions have been made about prior knowledge of speech signal characteristics. However, we assume that the speakers do not speak simultaneously and that we have no real-time constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775731","startPage":"502","endPage":"507","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2008.4775731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775633","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762293/4775633/04775731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Approach to Speaker Segmentation Based on Independent Component Analysis on GSM Digital Speech","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775731/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Approach to Speaker Segmentation Based on Independent Component Analysis on GSM Digital Speech","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4775731/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10470752","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Approach to Speaker Segmentation Based on Independent Component Analysis on GSM Digital Speech","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086853S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4762293","isNumber":"4775633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762293","xplore-issue":"4775633","articleId":"4775731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4775759,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-shuai Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Zhoukou Normal University, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Jin-shuai","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086215895"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2891-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4775759","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Testing","Filters","Computer science","Electronic mail","Image processing","Estimation theory","Degradation","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image processing","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","mixed noise filtering algorithm","genetic algorithm","L-filter","central limit theorem","weight coefficients","image edge information","Laplacian filter","median filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","L-filter","mixed noise model estimation","image edge information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4775759","abstract":"A novel algorithm for mixed noise filtering in image processing is presented, combing the genetic algorithm and L-filter.

It is a device formulated to describe the effects of range and Doppler on matched filter receivers. Woodward acknowledged the influence that Shannon's communication theory from 1948 had on his ideas; and he explained the relevance of ambiguity in radar signal processing, perhaps best conceived in terms of a form of the uncertainty principle (see the sections \"Motivation\" and \"Ambiguity Functions\"). However, in the 50 or so years since Woodward's book was published, radar signal processing has used the ambiguity function as an intricate and flexible tool in the design of waveforms to solve diverse problems in radar. In the process, substantial connections were established in mathematics, physics, and other areas of signal processing.

We focus on a closed-loop system that sequentially estimates the target and clutter scattering parameters, and then uses these estimates to select the polarization of the subsequent waveforms. We demonstrate that the radar system performance is significantly improved when the polarization of the transmitted signal is optimally and adaptively selected to match the polarimetric aspects of the target and environment. In particular, we provide an overview of our recent results showing that the adaptive design of the radar signal polarization enables achieving optimal performance in several operating modes, including detection, estimation, and tracking.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.930417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4775864/04775879.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.930417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target Estimation, Detection, and Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4775879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775879/","displayDocTitle":"Target Estimation, Detection, and Tracking","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475192","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4775879/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target Estimation, Detection, and Tracking","sourcePdf":"15-26msp01-hurtado.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080306S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4775864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4775864","articleId":"4775879","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4775880,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep P.

We have also reviewed emerging alternative signal fidelity measures and discussed their potential application to a wide variety of problems. The message we are trying to send here is not that one should abandon use of the MSE nor to blindly switch to any other particular signal fidelity measure. Rather, we hope to make the point that there are powerful, easy-to-use, and easy-to-understand alternatives that might be deployed depending on the application environment and needs. While we expect (and indeed, hope) that the MSE will continue to be widely used as a signal fidelity measure, it is our greater desire to see more advanced signal fidelity measures being used, especially in applications where perceptual criteria might be relevant. Ideally, the performance of a new signal processing algorithm might be compared to other algorithms using several fidelity criteria. Lastly, we hope that we have given further motivation to the community to consider recent advanced signal fidelity measures as design criteria for optimizing signal processing algorithms and systems. It is in this direction that we believe that the greatest benefit eventually lies.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.930649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4775864/04775883.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4775864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.930649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean squared error: Love it or leave it?

Paid clients (colluders) may illegally share copyrighted content files with unpaid clients (pirates). Such online piracy has hindered the use of open P2P networks for commercial content delivery. We propose a proactive content poisoning scheme to stop colluders and pirates from alleged copyright infringements in P2P file sharing. The basic idea is to detect pirates timely with identity-based signatures and time-stamped tokens. The scheme stops collusive piracy without hurting legitimate P2P clients by targeting poisoning on detected violators, exclusively. We developed a new peer authorization protocol (PAP) to distinguish pirates from legitimate clients. Detected pirates will receive poisoned chunks in their repeated attempts. Pirates are thus severely penalized with no chance to download successfully in tolerable time. Based on simulation results, we find 99.9 percent prevention rate in Gnutella, KaZaA, and Freenet.

Unfortunately, little raw data on failures in large IT installations are publicly available. This paper analyzes failure data collected at two large high-performance computing sites. The first data set has been collected over the past nine years at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and has recently been made publicly available. It covers 23,000 failures recorded on more than 20 different systems at LANL, mostly large clusters of SMP and NUMA nodes. The second data set has been collected over the period of one year on one large supercomputing system comprising 20 nodes and more than 10,000 processors. We study the statistics of the data, including the root cause of failures, the mean time between failures, and the mean time to repair. We find, for example, that average failure rates differ wildly across systems, ranging from 20-1000 failures per year, and that time between failures is modeled well by a Weibull distribution with decreasing hazard rate. From one system to another, mean repair time varies from less than an hour to more than a day, and repair times are well modeled by a lognormal distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4775906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","volume":"7","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11629937","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/4775906/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Large-Scale Study of Failures in High-Performance Computing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Large-Scale Study of Failures in High-Performance Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"ttq2010040337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110166S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5624749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"5624749","articleId":"4775906","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4776148,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Jian-juan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Jian-juan","id":"37087385249"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2385-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2386-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3908-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4776148","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776148","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Silicon compounds","Kalman filters","Genetic programming","Testing","Geography","Inertial navigation","Genetic algorithms","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filters","aerospace computing","evolutionary computation","inertial navigation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary neural network","integrated navigation system","adaptive Kalman filter","SINS","inertial navigation system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776148","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762424/4776129/04776148.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of evolutionary neural networks in integrated navigation system","abstract":"Performance of conventional Kalman filter, which is used in integrated navigation system, depends on precise system model and accurate observation data.

The experimental and simulation results show TW EO is more efficient and the streamlines are smoother than AC EO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A symmetry electrode array for AC and traveling wave electroosmosis pumping","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776194","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762424/4776129/04776194.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A symmetry electrode array for AC and traveling wave electroosmosis pumping","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776194/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10470798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A symmetry electrode array for AC and traveling wave electroosmosis pumping","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-02022009-00065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062432S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4762424","isNumber":"4776129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4762424","xplore-issue":"4776129","articleId":"4776194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4776198,"authors":[{"name":"Batsukh Batbayar","affiliation":["RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Batsukh Batbayar","id":"37088077769"},{"name":"Xinghuo Yu","affiliation":["RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Xinghuo Yu","id":"37087160675"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2385-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2386-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3908-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4776198","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Convergence","Feedforward neural networks","Computational modeling","Computer networks","Australia","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical character recognition software","Optical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm","terminal attractors","feedforward neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776198","pdfPath":"/iel5/4762424/4776129/04776198.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aerospace and Astronautics","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCAA.2008.4776198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm for neural networks based on terminal attractors","abstract":"In this paper, an improved Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm based on terminal attractors for feedforward neural networks is proposed.

Magnetically suspended flywheels (MSFW) with the advantages of no contact, no frication, high precision and long life, are the ideal actuators of high precision attitude control of satellites. But there still are several disturbing forces and torques in MSFW which affect the attitude control precision. Aimed at the main disturbing sources, the rotor imbalance, a rotor dynamic model is built and the error of traditional method in suppression of imbalance vibration is analyzed.

We consider both unicast and multicast traffic flows in the input specification. Multicast traffic flows are used in a variety of applications, and their direct support with only replication of packets at optimal bifurcation points rather than full end-to-end replication can significantly reduce network contention and resource requirements. Our problem formulation is based on the decomposition of the problem into the inter-related steps of finding good flow partitions, deriving a good physical network topology for each group in the partition, and providing an optimized network implementation for the derived topologies. Our solutions may be comprised of multiple custom networks, each interconnecting a subset of communicating modules. We propose several algorithms that can systematically examine different flow partitions, and we propose rectilinear-Steiner-tree (RST)-based algorithms for generating efficient network topologies. Our design flow integrates floorplanning, and our solutions consider deadlock-free routing. Experimental results on a variety of NoC benchmarks showed that our synthesis results can on average achieve a 4.82 times reduction in power consumption over different mesh implementations on unicast benchmarks and a 1.92 times reduction in power consumption on multicast benchmarks. Significant improvements in performance were also achieved, with an average of 2.92 times reduction in hop count on unicast benchmarks and 1.82 times reduction in hop count on multicast benchmarks. To further gauge the effectiveness of our heuristic algorithms, we also implemented an exact algorithm that enumerates all distinct set partitions. For the benchmarks where exact results could be obtained, our algorithms on average can achieve results within 3% of exact results, but with much shorter execution times.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4804122/04776413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804122","startPage":"342","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Custom Networks-on-Chip Architectures With Multicast Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Custom Networks-on-Chip Architectures With Multicast Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10545988","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4776413/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Custom Networks-on-Chip Architectures With Multicast Routing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yan-2011240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133152S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4804122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4804122","articleId":"4776413","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776420,"authors":[{"name":"Issam Mudawar","affiliation":["Mudawar Thermal Syst., West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6144/5170227/4776420/4776420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Issam Mudawar received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1980 and 1984, respectively.

The proposed steerable array uses 0deg tunable positive/negative-refractive-index (PRI/NRI) phase shifters to center its radiation about the broadside direction and allow scanning in both directions off the broadside. Using the PRI/NRI phase shifters also minimizes the squinting of the main beam across the operating bandwidth. The tunable PRI/NRI phase shifters employ 0.13-mum CMOS tunable active inductors, as well as varactors in order to extend their phase tuning range and maintain a low return loss across the entire phase tuning range. The feed network of the proposed array uses lambda/4 impedance transformers. This allows using identical interstage phase shifters, which share the same control voltages to tune all stages. Furthermore, using the impedance transformers in combination with the CMOS-based constant-impedance PRI/NRI phase shifters guarantees a low return loss for the antenna array across its entire scan angle range. The antenna array was fabricated, and is capable of continuously steering its main beam from -27deg to +22deg off the broadside direction with a gain of 8.4 dBi at 2.4 GHz. This is achieved by changing the varactors' control voltage from 3.5 to 15 V.

In this paper, we investigate cooperative diversity for intervehicular communication based on cascaded Nakagami fading. This channel model provides a realistic description of an intervehicular channel where two or more independent Nakagami fading processes are assumed to be generated by independent groups of scatterers around the two mobile terminals. We investigate the performance of amplify-and-forward relaying for an intervehicular cooperative scheme assisted by either a roadside access point or another vehicle that acts as a relay. Our diversity analysis reveals that the cooperative scheme is able to extract the full distributed spatial diversity. We further formulate a power-allocation problem for the considered scheme to optimize the power allocated to the broadcasting and relaying phases. Performance gains up to 3 dB are obtained through optimum power allocation, depending on the relay location.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04776427.pdf","startPage":"3301","endPage":"3310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2014685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2014685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Diversity for Intervehicular Communication: Performance Analysis and Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Relays","Mobile communication","Fading","Wireless communication","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Rayleigh channels","Rayleigh scattering","Road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","Nakagami channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity","intervehicular communication","performance analysis","performance optimization","Rayleigh fading channel model","wireless communication","stationary base station antenna","rooftop level","mobile station","cascaded Nakagami fading","intervehicular channel","independent Nakagami fading process","mobile terminals","amplify-and-forward relaying","intervehicular cooperative scheme","roadside access point","diversity analysis","distributed spatial diversity","power allocation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","fading channels","intervehicular communication","relay-assisted transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Diversity for Intervehicular Communication: Performance Analysis and Optimization","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4776427/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829082","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Diversity for Intervehicular Communication: Performance Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"tvt-altunbas-2014685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081218S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4776427","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776429,"authors":[{"name":"Siamak Sorooshyari","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Whippany, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Siamak","lastName":"Sorooshyari","id":"37421558400"},{"name":"David G.

In this paper, definitions of exploration and exploitation are first given based on information correlation among samplings. Then, some general indicators of optimization hardness are presented to characterize problem difficulties. By analyzing a typical contraction-based three-stage optimization process, optimal contraction theorem is presented to show that \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T:Er&amp;Ei</i>\n depends on the optimization hardness of problems to be optimized. \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T:Er&amp;Ei</i>\n will gradually lean toward exploration as optimization hardness increases. In the case of great optimization hardness, exploration-dominated optimizers outperform exploitation-dominated optimizers. In particular, random sampling will become an outstanding optimizer when optimization hardness reaches a certain degree. Besides, the optimal number of contraction stages increases with optimization hardness. In an optimal contraction way, the whole sampling cost is evenly distributed in all contraction stages, and each contraction takes the same contracting ratio. Furthermore, the characterization of optimization hardness is discussed in detail. The experiments with several typical global optimization algorithms used to optimize three groups of test problems validate the correctness of the conclusions made by \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T:Er&amp;Ei</i>\n analysis.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2012436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815381","startPage":"680","endPage":"691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4815381/04776436.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Contraction Theorem for Exploration\u2013Exploitation Tradeoff in Search and Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4776436/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Contraction Theorem for Exploration\u2013Exploitation Tradeoff in Search and Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10574873","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Contraction Theorem for Exploration\u2013Exploitation Tradeoff in Search and Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsmca-xin-2012436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132327S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4815381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4815381","articleId":"4776436","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4776452,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Ma","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4786573/4776452/4776452-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianwei Ma received the Ph.D. degree in solid mechanics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002.","He was a Visiting Scholar, Research Fellow, Postdoctoral Scientist, and Guest Professor with the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., the University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., the University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, U.K., the Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France, the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

Recently, a compressed-sensing (CS) theorem which provides a new sampling theory for data acquisition has been applied for medical and astronomic imaging. The CS makes it possible to take superresolution photos using only one or a few pixels, rather than million pixels, with a conventional digital camera. Here, we further consider a so-called CS deblurring problem: Can we still obtain clear pictures from highly incomplete measurements when blurring disturbances occur? A decoding algorithm based on Poisson singular integral and iterative curvelet thresholding is proposed to correct the deblurring problem with surprisingly incomplete measurements. It permits one to design robust and practical compressed-imaging instruments involving less imaging time, less storage space, less power consumption, smaller size, and cheaper than currently used charged coupled device cameras, which effectively match the needs, particularly for probes sent very far away. It essentially shifts the onboard imaging cost to an offline recovery computational cost. Potential applications in aerospace remote sensing of the Chinese Chang'e-1 lunar probe are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4786573/04776452.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4786573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deblurring From Highly Incomplete Measurements for Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776452/","displayDocTitle":"Deblurring From Highly Incomplete Measurements for Remote Sensing","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10498820","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776452/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deblurring From Highly Incomplete Measurements for Remote Sensing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ma-2004709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093489S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4786573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4786573","articleId":"4776452","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776454,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Aiazzi","affiliation":["Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara, Consiglio Nationale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Aiazzi","id":"37265825500"},{"name":"Stefano Baronti","affiliation":["Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara, Consiglio Nationale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Baronti","id":"37272261300"},{"name":"Franco Lotti","affiliation":["Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara, Consiglio Nationale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Lotti","id":"37357540900"},{"name":"Massimo Selva","affiliation":["Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara, Consiglio Nationale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Selva","id":"37399650400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4776454","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":910},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multispectral imaging","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Image fusion","Protocols","Multiresolution analysis","Data mining","Context modeling","Image analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","image fusion","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context adaptive pansharpening","multispectral images","multiresolution analysis","component substitution","image fusion algorithms","panchromatic images","context-adaptive injection models","IKONOS","Pleiades"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Component substitution (CS) pansharpening","context-adaptive (CA) injection model","high-resolution satellite data","multiresolution analysis (MRA)","Gram\u2013Schmidt (GS) spectral sharpening"]}],"abstract":"Multiresolution analysis (MRA) and component substitution (CS) are the two basic frameworks to which image fusion algorithms can be reported when merging multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) images (pansharpening), acquired with different spatial and spectral resolutions. State-of-the-art algorithms add the spatial details extracted from the Pan into the MS data set by considering different injection strategies. The capability of efficiently modeling the relationships between MS and Pan is crucial for the quality of fusion results and particularly for a correct recovery of local features with a consequent reduction of spectral distortions. Although context-adaptive (CA) injection models have been proposed in the MRA framework, their adoption in CS schemes has been scarcely investigated so far. In this letter, CA strategies are compared with global models by considering a general protocol in which both MRA- and CS-based schemes can be described. Qualitative and quantitative results are reported for three high-resolution data sets from two different sensors, namely, IKONOS and simulated Pleiades. The score gains of well-known and novel quality figures show that CA models are more efficient than global ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison Between Global and Context-Adaptive Pansharpening of Multispectral Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2008.2012003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4814847/04776454.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.2012003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison Between Global and Context-Adaptive Pansharpening of Multispectral Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4776454/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10572759","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison Between Global and Context-Adaptive Pansharpening of Multispectral Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-aiazzi-2012003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062494S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4814847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4814847","articleId":"4776454","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4776456,"authors":[{"name":"Turker Ince*","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Izmir University of Economics, Izmir, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4976166/4776456/4776456-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Turker Ince received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1994, the M.S. degree from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass-Amherst), in 2001, all in electrical engineering.","From 1996 to 2001, he was a Research Assistant at the Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory, UMass-Amherst.

The proposed feature extraction process utilizes morphological wavelet transform features, which are projected onto a lower dimensional feature space using principal component analysis, and temporal features from the ECG data. For the pattern recognition unit, feedforward and fully connected artificial neural networks, which are optimally designed for each patient by the proposed multidimensional particle swarm optimization technique, are employed. By using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, the proposed classification system can adapt to significant interpatient variations in ECG patterns by training the optimal network structure, and thus, achieves higher accuracy over larger datasets. The classification experiments over a benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed system achieves such average accuracies and sensitivities better than most of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for detection of ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and supra-VEBs (SVEBs). Over the entire database, the average accuracy-sensitivity performances of the proposed system for VEB and SVEB detections are 98.3%-84.6% and 97.4%-63.5%, respectively. Finally, due to its parameter-invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2013934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4976166/04776456.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2013934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic and Robust System for Automated Patient-Specific Classification of ECG Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Generic and Robust System for Automated Patient-Specific Classification of ECG Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776456/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10666085","pubMedId":"19203885","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776456/","volume":"56","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic and Robust System for Automated Patient-Specific Classification of ECG Signals","sourcePdf":"tbme-ince-2013934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167954S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4976166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"4976166","articleId":"4776456","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4776461,"authors":[{"name":"Jose C.

Nearly all methods aiming at assessing the risk of plaque rupture are based on its characterization from 2-D ultrasound images, which depends on plaque geometry, degree of stenosis, and echo morphology (intensity and texture). The computation of these indicators is, however, usually affected by inaccuracy and subjectivity associated with data acquisition and operator-dependent image selection. To circumvent these limitations, a novel and simple method based on 3-D freehand ultrasound is proposed that does not require any expensive equipment except the common scanner. This method comprises the 3-D reconstruction of carotids and plaques to provide clinically meaningful parameters not available in 2-D ultrasound imaging, namely diagnostic views not usually accessible via conventional techniques and local 3-D characterization of plaque echo morphology. The labeling procedure, based on graph cuts, allows us to identify, locate, and quantify potentially vulnerable foci within the plaque. Validation of the characterization method was made with synthetic data.

We show that the standard nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) scheme is a shift invariant approximation of the exact Fourier transform. Based on the theory of shift-invariant representations, we derive an exact expression for the worst-case mean square approximation error. Using this metric, we evaluate the optimal scale-factors and the interpolator that provides the least approximation error. We also derive the upper-bound for the error component due to the lookup tablebased evaluation of the interpolator; we use this metric to ensure that this component is not the dominant one. Theoretical and experimental comparisons with standard NUFFT schemes clearly demonstrate the significant improvement in accuracy over conventional schemes, especially when the size of the uniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) is small. Since the memory requirement of the algorithm is dependent on the size of the uniform FFT, the proposed developments can lead to iterative signal reconstruction algorithms with significantly lower memory demands.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2014809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4939475/04776463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2014809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939475","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Least-Square Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Least-Square Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664140","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4776463/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Least-Square Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"57tsp05-mjacob-2014809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087013S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4939475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4939475","articleId":"4776463","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776469,"authors":[{"name":"Usman A.

The sensors and anchors, nodes in the network, exchange data with their neighbors only; no centralized data processing or communication occurs, nor is there a centralized fusion center to compute the sensors' locations. DILOC uses the barycentric coordinates of a node with respect to its neighbors; these coordinates are computed using the Cayley-Menger determinants, i.e., the determinants of matrices of internode distances. We show convergence of DILOC by associating with it an absorbing Markov chain whose absorbing states are the states of the anchors. We introduce a stochastic approximation version extending DILOC to random environments, i.e., when the communications among nodes is noisy, the communication links among neighbors may fail at random times, and the internodes distances are subject to errors. We show a.s. convergence of the modified DILOC and characterize the error between the true values of the sensors' locations and their final estimates given by DILOC.

Carbon monoxide (CO) metal-oxide (MOX) sensors could be suitable in terms of device cost, but they show some severe limits, such as the need to be heated, which means large power consumption and the need for complex and frequent calibration procedures, which increases the overall cost. This paper investigates the possibility to partially overcome these limits by a low-cost detection system based on a suitable commercial sensor (TGS 2442, Figaro, Inc.) and an ad hoc measurement technique exploiting specifically tailored temperature profiles. To this aim, the authors study the dynamic behavior of low-power CO MOX sensors operated with pulsed temperature profiles by means of two approaches: 1) sensor modeling and 2) experimental evaluation. To analyze how the sensor dynamic response changes as a function of the CO concentration, the authors individuate a temperature profile, which ensures satisfactory sensitivity to the target gas and very low power consumption. Moreover, some parameters describing the sensor response shape are selected, which prove to be significant in terms of both robustness to environmental conditions and calibration simplicity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10560702","htmlLink":"/document/4776471/","displayDocTitle":"Model and Experimental Characterization of the Dynamic Behavior of Low-Power Carbon Monoxide MOX Sensors Operated With Pulsed Temperature Profiles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model and Experimental Characterization of the Dynamic Behavior of Low-Power Carbon Monoxide MOX Sensors Operated With Pulsed Temperature Profiles","sourcePdf":"tim-fort-2012940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113573S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4812252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4812252","articleId":"4776471","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4776472,"authors":[{"name":"Richard K.

Similarly, in navigation systems that do not rely on the global positioning system (GPS), ldquosignals of opportunityrdquo (existing wireless infrastructure) can be used as ad hoc navigation beacons, and the goal is to determine their location relative to a receiver and thus deduce the receiver's position. These two research problems have a very similar mathematical structure. Specifically, in either the source localization or navigation problem, one common approach relies on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements to multiple sensors. In this paper, we investigate a bandwidth efficient method of TDOA computation when the signals of opportunity use multicarrier modulation. By exploiting the structure of the multicarrier transmission, much less information needs to be exchanged between sensors compared to the standard cross correlation approach. Analytic and simulation results quantify the performance of the proposed algorithm as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the bandwidth between the sensors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4939475/04776472.pdf","startPage":"2311","endPage":"2322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2014813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2014813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Efficient Cooperative TDOA Computation for Multicarrier Signals of Opportunity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Wireless sensor networks","Navigation","Acoustic emission","Acoustic sensors","Global Positioning System","Motion planning","Time difference of arrival","Time measurement","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","source separation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative TDOA computation","multicarrier signals","source localization","global positioning system","time difference of arrival","bandwidth efficient method","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier","navigation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","source localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Efficient Cooperative TDOA Computation for Multicarrier Signals of Opportunity","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4776472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664141","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Efficient Cooperative TDOA Computation for Multicarrier Signals of Opportunity","sourcePdf":"57tsp05-rmartin-2014813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075308S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4939475","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4939475","articleId":"4776472","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776479,"authors":[{"name":"Onur Ozdemir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4814882/4776479/4776479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Onur Ozdemir (S'06) was born in Ankara, Turkey, on March 4, 1980.

Based on Chen in their work about a terminal architecture for cognitive radio networks, by further obtaining transmission information with a rate-distance nature that is extended from an overlay concept, secondary systems can even leverage busy duration of primary systems to enhance the opportunity to use spectrum under derived tolerable interference to the primary orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system. Our proposed novel multistate (i.e., existence, activity, and data transmission rate) spectrum sensing can thus effectively acquire a set of cognitive information for OFDMA mobile communication systems under a general system model. Through the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), fundamental symbol rate, cyclic property of the OFDMA signal, and the control and management signal, we can precisely determine the existence and activity of the primary (OFDMA) system within a subband via Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion.

The control scheme is based on a fuzzy rule-based body slip angle (beta) observer. In the design strategy of the fuzzy observer, the vehicle dynamics is represented by Takagi-Sugeno-like fuzzy models. Initially, local equivalent vehicle models are built using the linear approximations of vehicle dynamics for low and high lateral acceleration operating regimes, respectively. The optimal beta observer is then designed for each local model using Kalman filter theory. Finally, local observers are combined to form the overall control system by using fuzzy rules. These fuzzy rules represent the qualitative relationships among the variables associated with the nonlinear and uncertain nature of vehicle dynamics, such as tire force saturation and the influence of road adherence. An adaptation mechanism for the fuzzy membership functions has been incorporated to improve the accuracy and performance of the system. The effectiveness of this design approach has been demonstrated in simulations and in a real-time experimental setting.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2013737","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1419","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04776489.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2013737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Yaw-Moment Control of an In-Wheel-Motored Electric Vehicle Based on Body Slip Angle Fuzzy Observer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Fuzzy control","Vehicle dynamics","Fuzzy systems","Takagi-Sugeno model","Linear approximation","Acceleration","Control systems","Tires","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","fuzzy control","Kalman filters","nonlinear control systems","observers","position control","road vehicles","uncertain systems","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct yaw-moment control","in-wheel-motored electric vehicle","stabilizing observer-based control algorithm","fuzzy rule-based body slip angle observer-based","Takagi-Sugeno-like fuzzy models","vehicle dynamics linear approximations","Kalman filter theory","tire force saturation","road adherence","fuzzy membership functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy observer","local modeling","state feedback","vehicle lateral dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Direct Yaw-Moment Control of an In-Wheel-Motored Electric Vehicle Based on Body Slip Angle Fuzzy Observer","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4776489/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10601668","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Yaw-Moment Control of an In-Wheel-Motored Electric Vehicle Based on Body Slip Angle Fuzzy Observer","sourcePdf":"tie-geng-2013737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129525S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4776489","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4776490,"authors":[{"name":"Amir M.

A conventional multilevel inverter produces 6n plusmn 1 (n = odd) harmonics in the phase voltage during overmodulation and in the extreme square-wave mode of operation. However, this inverter produces a 12-sided polygonal space vector location, leading to the elimination of 6n plusmn 1 (n = odd) harmonics in the overmodulation region extending to a final 12-step mode of operation with a smooth transition. The benefits of this arrangement are lower losses and reduced torque pulsation in an induction motor drive fed from this converter at higher modulation indexes. The inverter is fabricated by using three conventional cascaded two-level inverters with asymmetric dc-bus voltages. A comparative simulation study of the harmonic distortion in the phase voltage and associated losses in conventional multilevel inverters and that of the proposed inverter is presented in this paper. Experimental validation on a prototype shows that the proposed converter is suitable for high-power applications because of low harmonic distortion and low losses.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2013751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04776495.pdf","startPage":"1657","endPage":"1664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2013751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combination of Hexagonal and 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vector PWM Control for IM Drives Using Cascaded Two-Level Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776495/","displayDocTitle":"A Combination of Hexagonal and 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vector PWM Control for IM Drives Using Cascaded Two-Level Inverters","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601666","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776495/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combination of Hexagonal and 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vector PWM Control for IM Drives Using Cascaded Two-Level Inverters","sourcePdf":"tie-gopakumar-2013751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079278S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4776495","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776497,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco D.

In such applications, the primary objectives are an accurate cancellation of selected harmonics and a quick speed of response under transients. This paper provides a novel signal-processing algorithm for selective harmonic identification based on heterodyning, moving average finite-impulse response filters, and phase-locked loop (PLL). The algorithm is applied over the current of a nonlinear load in the feedforward-based control of an APF. The PLL tracks the phase and frequency of the fundamental component. Then, the fundamental phase is multiplied by the order of the selected harmonic, and two random unitary orthogonal \"axis waves\" are generated. These unitary waves, rotating at the harmonic frequency, are multiplied by the input load current, thereby \"moving\" the Fourier series coefficients of the selected harmonic to DC (heterodyning). Moving average FIR filters are used to filter the harmonics generated in the heterodyning process from the DC signal; moving average FIR filters are very suitable for most of the power quality applications, thanks to their \"comb-type\" frequency response and their quick transient response. Experimental results confirm good performance for steady-state harmonic cancellation and an optimal system response to load transients. The theory of the algorithm has been developed for single- and three-phase systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2013844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04776497.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2013844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Signal-Processing Adaptive Algorithm for Selective Current Harmonic Cancellation in Active Power Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776497/","displayDocTitle":"A Signal-Processing Adaptive Algorithm for Selective Current Harmonic Cancellation in Active Power Filters","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793114","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776497/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Signal-Processing Adaptive Algorithm for Selective Current Harmonic Cancellation in Active Power Filters","sourcePdf":"tie-freijedo-2013844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082716S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4776497","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776499,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Geun Song","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5062301/4776499/4776499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung Geun Song was born in Gwangju, Korea.

This algorithm merges and adds hidden neurons during the training process of ANNs. The merge operation introduced in AMGA is a kind of a mixed mode operation, which is equivalent to pruning two neurons and adding one neuron. Unlike most previous studies, AMGA puts emphasis on autonomous functioning in the design process of ANNs. This is the main reason why AMGA uses an adaptive not a predefined fixed strategy in designing ANNs. The adaptive strategy merges or adds hidden neurons based on the learning ability of hidden neurons or the training progress of ANNs. In order to reduce the amount of retraining after modifying ANN architectures, AMGA prunes hidden neurons by merging correlated hidden neurons and adds hidden neurons by splitting existing hidden neurons. The proposed AMGA has been tested on a number of benchmark problems in machine learning and ANNs, including breast cancer, Australian credit card assessment, and diabetes, gene, glass, heart, iris, and thyroid problems. The experimental results show that AMGA can design compact ANN architectures with good generalization ability compared to other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10560655","pubMedId":"19203888","volume":"39","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4776509/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Adaptive Merging and Growing Algorithm for Designing Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Adaptive Merging and Growing Algorithm for Designing Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-islam-2008724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128877S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4812115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4812115","articleId":"4776509","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4776510,"authors":[{"name":"Bhim Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5173586/4776510/4776510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bhim Singh (SM'99) was born in Rahamapur, India, in 1956.

SAF is controlled using an adaptive-linear-element (Adaline)-based current estimator to maintain sinusoidal and unity-power-factor source currents. Three-phase load currents are sensed, and using least mean square (LMS) algorithm-based Adaline, online calculation of weights is performed and these weights are multiplied by the unit vector templates, which give the fundamental-frequency real component of load currents. The dc bus voltage of voltage source converter (VSC) working as a SAF is maintained at constant value using a proportional-integral controller. The switching of VSC is performed using hysteresis-based pulsewidth-modulation indirect-current-control scheme, which controls the source currents to follow the derived reference source currents. The practical implementation of the SAF is realized using dSPACE DS1104 R&D controller having TMS320F240 as a slave DSP. The MATLAB-based simulation results and implementation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAF with Adaline-based control for load compensation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5173586/04776510.pdf","startPage":"2811","endPage":"2820","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2014367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2014367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Implementation of an Adaptive Control Algorithm for a Three-Phase Shunt Active Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776510/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Implementation of an Adaptive Control Algorithm for a Three-Phase Shunt Active Filter","htmlLink":"/document/4776510/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793123","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implementation of an Adaptive Control Algorithm for a Three-Phase Shunt Active Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-solanki-2014367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089154S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5173586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"5173586","articleId":"4776510","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4776513,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed M.

These sensors are expected to replace existing wired sensors used in industrial-plant management and environmental monitoring. These filters, together with MEMS-based oscillators and mixers, are expected to replace off-chip components and enable the development of a single-chip transceiver. Such a transceiver will leverage the integrated MEMS components' characteristics to operate at lower power and, hence, longer battery life, making autonomous WSNs more feasible in a wider range of applications. As a result, this paper presents the design and optimization of the coupling beam of wineglass-mode micromechanical disk filters using simulated annealing. The filter under consideration consists of two identical wineglass-mode disk resonators, mechanically coupled by a flexural-mode beam. The coupled two-resonator system exhibits two mechanical-resonance modes with closely spaced frequencies that define the filter passband. A constraint is added on the beam length to eliminate the effect of the coupling-beam mass on the filter's resonant frequency. A new process flow is proposed to realize self-aligned overhanging coupling beams designed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2014671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4808369/04776513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2014671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808369","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Spring Coupling for High-- High-Frequency MEMS Filters for Wireless Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Spring Coupling for High-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> High-Frequency MEMS Filters for Wireless Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10557970","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4776513/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Spring Coupling for High-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex></formula> High-Frequency MEMS Filters for Wireless Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-saitou-2014671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190666S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4808369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4808369","articleId":"4776513","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4776514,"authors":[{"name":"Lauric Garbuio","affiliation":["Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie \u00e9lectrique et Ferro\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 EA 682, Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4808369/4776514/4776514-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lauric Garbuio was born in France in 1976.

This can be explained not only by advances in microlectronics and energy harvesting technologies, but also by a growing industrial demand in wireless autonomous devices. In this field, piezoelectric elements offer outstanding performances, thanks to their high power density that makes them suitable for integrated microgenerators. However, such a domain still offers challenges to the research community. Particularly, embedding piezoelectric inserts as MEMS components raises the issue of low voltage output. Classical energy harvesting interfaces that feature bridge rectifier suffer from threshold voltage introduced by such discrete components, therefore compromising their use in real-life applications. In this paper is presented a new energy harvesting circuit that operates with ultralow voltage output, by the use of a magnetic voltage rectifier that does not present significant voltage gap. Experimental measurements performed on a simple transducer confirm theoretical predictions, and show that the proposed architecture operates well even for low-level vibrations, outperforming all known energy interfaces. Particularly, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that such an interface provides a gain greater than 50 compared to classical energy harvesting structures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10547497","htmlLink":"/document/4776514/","displayDocTitle":"Mechanical Energy Harvester With Ultralow Threshold Rectification Based on SSHI Nonlinear Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanical Energy Harvester With Ultralow Threshold Rectification Based on SSHI Nonlinear Technique","sourcePdf":"tie-garbuio-2014673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083774S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4808369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4808369","articleId":"4776514","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4776516,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghui Hu","affiliation":["Intelligent Control Laboratory, Center of Systems and Control, College of Engineering, and Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4776516/4776516-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghui Hu received the B.E. degree in automation from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004.

Based on our robotic fish prototype, the forces and moments acting on its fins and body are analyzed, and the governing motion equations are derived. We further investigate a decentralized control method in target-tracking and collision-avoidance task for two autonomous robotic fish. Most of previous work on the task strategies of autonomous robots is focused on terrestrial robots and seldom deals with underwater applications due to the uncertainties and complexity in a hydro environment. To address this challenge in such an underwater task, a situated-behavior-based decentralized control is employed on each robotic fish according to its visual data. On dealing with motion planning of the fish during target tracking and collision avoidance, a control law by a combination of an attractive force toward a target and a repulsive force for collision avoidance is utilized. Experimental results of the task performed by two autonomous robotic fish validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2014675","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04776516.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2014675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Based Target Tracking and Collision Avoidance for Two Autonomous Robotic Fish","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Collision avoidance","Robot vision systems","Marine animals","Distributed control","Force","Prototypes","Motion analysis","Equations","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","decentralised control","marine systems","mobile robots","motion control","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-based target tracking","collision avoidance","autonomous robotic fish","vision-based autonomous robotic fish","3D locomotion","motion equations","decentralized control method","terrestrial robots","motion planning","target tracking","repulsive force"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous robotic fish","collision avoidance","decentralized control","situated behavior","target tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Vision-Based Target Tracking and Collision Avoidance for Two Autonomous Robotic Fish","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4776516/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10601693","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Based Target Tracking and Collision Avoidance for Two Autonomous Robotic Fish","sourcePdf":"tie-zhao-2014675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066268S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4776516","onlineDate":"06 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":4776530,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Faggin","affiliation":["Synaptics Inc., and Zilog, Inc"],"bio":{"p":["Federico Faggin (Faggin@foveon.com) is president, chief executive officer, and a director of Foveon Inc.

This letter considers bias and variance issues in estimating powers of distances from RSS affected by practical log-normal shadowing.

First, the least-squared estimated channel frequency responses on pilot tones are used to generate two auto-correlation matrices with different lags. Then, according to these two matrices, a Doppler dependent parameter is measured. Based on a time-varying multipath channel model, the parameter is expanded and then transformed into a nonlinear high-order polynomial equation, from which the maximum Doppler spread is readily solved by using the Newton's method. The delay-subspace is utilized to reduce the noise that biases the estimator. Besides, the subspace tracking algorithm is adopted as well to automatically update the delay-subspace. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges for a wide range of SNRs and Dopplers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing

In the proposed methods, Hermitian matrices are loaded on sample covariance matrix, and this is different from those methods based on the well-known diagonal loading approach.

The previously proposed conventional ACO based MUDs were unable to provide soft log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values for the channel decoder. Hence, to solve this open problem, we commence by proposing the Maximum-Approximation (MAA) assisted SO-ACO algorithm, leading to a novel MUA assisted SO-ACO algorithm, which subsumes the MAA algorithm as a particular case and outperforms the MAA algorithm. More explicitly, at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 dB, the BER performance of the convolutional coding (CC) aided CDMA UL employing the MAA SO-ACO is improved from 5.2middot10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n to 2.7middot10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n by employing the MUA SO-ACO.

In segmenting real-world images, the cost of misclassification could depend on the true class. For example, in a two-class (negative or positive class) problem, the cost of misclassifying positive to negative class could not be equal to that of misclassifying negative to positive class. However, existing algorithms do not take into account the unequal misclassification cost. In this letter, motivated by recent advances in machine learning theory, we introduce a procedure to minimize the misclassification cost with class-dependent cost. The procedure assumes the hidden Markov model (HMM) which has been popularly used for image segmentation in recent years. We represent all feasible HMM-based segmenters (or classifiers) as a set of points in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. Then, the optimal segmenter (or classifier) is found by computing the tangential point between the iso-cost line with given slope and the convex hull of the feasible set in the ROC space. We illustrate the procedure by segmenting aerial images with different selection of misclassification costs.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.2008586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4776557/04776580.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.2008586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective Hidden Markov Model-Based Image Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776580/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Hidden Markov Model-Based Image Segmentation","volume":"16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10471614","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776580/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Hidden Markov Model-Based Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"lsp-pyun-2008586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059997S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4776557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4776557","articleId":"4776580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4776631,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280099900"},{"name":"Puya Afshar","affiliation":["Control Systems Centre, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Puya","lastName":"Afshar","id":"37301743500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9797-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-3011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-302X"}],"articleNumber":"4776631","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Stochastic processes","Shape control","Stochastic systems","Probability density function","Size control","Weight control","Closed loop systems","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stochastic systems","RBF neural networks","iterative learning mechanism","probability density functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776631","abstract":"In this paper, an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) scheme is presented for the control of the shape of the output probability density functions (PDF) for a class of stochastic systems in which the relationship between approximation basis functions and the control input is linear, and the stochastic system is not necessarily Gaussian.

A three-stage method for the ILC-based PDF control is proposed which incorporates a) identifying PDF model parameters; b) calculating the control input; and c) updating RFBN parameters.

SF-ART has two stages. At first stage, pre-classification level, the input data is clustered roughly to arbitrary (M) classes using self-organized fuzzy ART tuned for fast learning. At the second stage, post-classification level, the SF-ART performs supervised clustering using a special array called affine look-up table (ALT) with M elements, which are used to store the labels of corresponding input samples. In testing mode, first the self-organized fuzzy ART classifies the input data roughly. In the next step, the content of an ALT cell with address equal to the index of the first stage's winning output line will be read. The read value declares the class that input data belongs to. Initial tests with BCG from six subjects (both healthy and unhealthy people) indicate that the method can classify the subjects into three classes with a high accuracy, high learning speed (elapsed time for learning around half second), and very low computational load compared with the well-known neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (elapsed time for learning above five minutes). The method is insensitive to latency and non-linear disturbance.

This paper proposes an atomic force microscope (AFM) based force controller to push nano particles on the substrates. A block phase correlation-based algorithm is embedded into the controller for the compensation of the thermal drift which is considered as the main external uncertainty during nanomanipulation. Then, the interactive forces and dynamics between the tip and the particle, particle and the substrate are modeled and analyzed. Further, an adaptive critic NN controller based on adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is designed and the task of pushing nano particles is demonstrated. This adaptive critic NN position/force controller utilizes a single NN in order to approximate the cost functional and subsequently the optimal control input is calculated. Finally, the convergence of the states, NN weight estimates and force errors are shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive critic neural network force controller for atomic force microscope-based nanomanipulation","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776690","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776690.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive critic neural network force controller for atomic force microscope-based nanomanipulation","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776690/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive critic neural network force controller for atomic force microscope-based nanomanipulation","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066234S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4776691,"authors":[{"name":"Salman Mohagheghi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Mohagheghi","id":"37268035400"},{"name":"Ganesh K.

The heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) method, a member of the adaptive critic designs (ACD) family, is used for the design of the STATCOM neurocontroller. The proposed controller is a nonlinear optimal controller that provides coupled control for the line voltage and the dc link voltage regulation loops of the STATCOM. An action dependent approach is used, in which the controller is independent of a model of the network. Moreover, a proportional-integrator approach allows the neurocontroller to deal with the actual signals rather than the deviations. Simulation results are provided to show that the proposed ACD based neurocontroller is more effective in controlling the STATCOM compared to finely tuned conventional PI controllers.","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776691","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776691.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive critic designs based coupled neurocontrollers for a static compensator","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4776691/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive critic designs based coupled neurocontrollers for a static compensator","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057164S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4776718,"authors":[{"name":"Aldo Balestrino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi Elettrici e Automazione, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"Balestrino","id":"37300961800"},{"name":"Alberto Landi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi Elettrici e Automazione, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Landi","id":"37300951800"},{"name":"Luca Pacini","affiliation":["Robotics and Automation, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Pacini","id":"38187707700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9797-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-3011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-302X"}],"articleNumber":"4776718","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"abstract":"In this paper a vision system for the control quality in a factory of corrugated cardboard is described. The problem under study is the automatic detection and monitoring of the sheets of cardboard constituting a unit of sale. A precise measurement of the number of sheets is a difficult task, since, during the process, some sheets must be discarded, because of their inferior quality, or because they have been damaged during the transport. Usually, the number of the sheets is estimated from the ratio between the weight of the unit and the nominal weight of a single sheet. Since the weight of a sheet is uncertain, an estimation based on the weight ratio is poor and its reliability is very low. A different solution is proposed in this paper: it estimates the number of the sheets via a suitable vision system. It offers a very high precision (the middle error is smaller of 2%) and it has the advantages to avoid invasive interactions with the process of production and to be a low cost solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776718.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision system for monitoring the production of corrugated cardboard","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Production systems","Marketing and sales","Control systems","Production facilities","Costs","Personnel","Pulp manufacturing","Computerized monitoring","Error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Vision system for monitoring the production of corrugated cardboard","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision system for monitoring the production of corrugated cardboard","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071508S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4776727,"authors":[{"name":"Nem Stefanovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Edward S.

Based on this knowledge, adequate motion for inoperable DoFs in impaired patients is estimated on-line from sound limb motion. Thus, the intention of a partially paralyzed person or an amputee can be deduced from residual body motion, in order to coordinately actuate or supervise the impaired limbs.

An efficient technique to implement multiple behaviors in robots using FPGA based partial reconfigurable hardware is presented in this paper. Robots built using reconfigurable FPGAs can have their functionalities modified at run-time without completely taking the robot off-line. Resource efficiency increases because only the modules corresponding to the current behavior are implemented in the FPGA while inactive modules are stored in an external memory. The approach is validated through a case study where teams of robots are configured to meet application specific requirements and the run-time behaviors of these robots are modified dynamically using Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776816.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1225","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of dynamic run-time behavior reconfiguration in robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Runtime","Intelligent robots","Orbital robotics","Costs","Hardware","Microcontrollers","Energy consumption","Transceivers","Circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of dynamic run-time behavior reconfiguration in robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776816/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of dynamic run-time behavior reconfiguration in robots","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037855S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4776879,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Di Marco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u00edInformazione, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Di Marco","id":"37270739400"},{"name":"Mauro Forti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u00edInformazione, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Forti","id":"37270735600"},{"name":"Alberto Tesi","affiliation":["Dipartiento di Sistemi e Informatica, University of Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Tesi","id":"37270737200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9797-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-3011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-302X"}],"articleNumber":"4776879","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Cellular neural networks","Information processing","Intelligent sensors","Stationary state","Neurons","Sparse matrices","Symmetric matrices","Hardware","Asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","matrix algebra","neurocontrollers","perturbation techniques","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness","cellular neural network","neuron interconnection matrix","complete stability","perturbations","nominal symmetric interconnections"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776879","abstract":"Cellular neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most popular paradigms for real-time information processing. Recently, CNNs have found interesting applications in the solution of on-line optimization problems, and the implementation of intelligent sensors. In these applications the CNNs are required to be completely stable, i.e. each trajectory should converge toward a stationary state. Such an important dynamical property is typically guaranteed by requiring that the neuron interconnection matrix is symmetric. The present paper investigates the issue of robustness of complete stability, with respect to perturbations of the nominal symmetric interconnections, deriving from the hardware implementation of the CNNs. In particular, a class of circular one-dimensional CNNs with nearest-neighbor interconnections only, is considered. The class has sparse interconnections and is subject to perturbations which preserve the interconnecting structure. It is shown that in the general case complete stability is not robust for this class of CNNs, i.e., there are small perturbations leading to the loss of all nominal asymptotically stable equilibrium points. This paper extends previous work on robustness of complete stability of CNNs, and confirms the importance to develop design methods that guarantee not only complete stability on the nominal symmetric case, but also its robustness with respect to tolerances in the implementation","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776879","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776879.pdf","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1601","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness of complete stability for a class of nearly-symmetric cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of complete stability for a class of nearly-symmetric cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","accessionNumber":"9286939","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4776879/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of complete stability for a class of nearly-symmetric cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057531S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4776888,"authors":[{"name":"Dongchul Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science(M/C 249), University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongchul","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37286824300"},{"name":"Stephen S. -T.

Traditionally these controllers have been implemented in analog or digital form on specifically dedicated communication links. However, there has been significant recent interest into deploying control over general purpose communication channels, which allow one to transmit data, voice and control signals. Naturally the successful design of such a networked control system necessitates a blend of techniques which reflect both control and communication aspects. The present work examines the effect of channel noise (or, equivalently, of channel capacity) on closed loop system behaviour.

In literature several proposals for event-driven controllers are made in order to reduce the number of control updates and consequently the processor load needed for its implementation. This is possible without deteriorating the control performance significantly. However, experimental validation has not been presented in literature. This paper aims at filling this gap. Simulations, as well as experiments on a copier paper path test setup, show that a reduction in the number of control updates indeed results in a considerable reduction of the processor load, with only a small decrease of control performance. Furthermore, we present a method to predict the processor load very accurately, without having to implement the controller on a test setup.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and experimental validation of processor load for event-driven controllers","doi":"10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776927","endPage":"1884","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768844/4776587/04776927.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design, 2006 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","startPage":"1879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD-CCA-ISIC.2006.4776927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4776927","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Error correction","Digital control","Process control","Optimal control","Frequency measurement","Testing","Control systems","Mechanical engineering","Signal design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and experimental validation of processor load for event-driven controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4776927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4776927/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and experimental validation of processor load for event-driven controllers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042118S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4776927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4776950,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro dos Santos Coelho","affiliation":["Pontifical Catholic University of Parana, Automation and System Laboratory, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"dos Santos Coelho","id":"37275647200"},{"name":"Antonio Augusto Rodrigues Coelho","affiliation":["Federal University of Santa Catarina, Department of Automation and Systems, Box 476, ZIP CODE 88040-900, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil"],"firstName":"Antonio Augusto","lastName":"Rodrigues Coelho","id":"37087597432"},{"name":"Rodrigo R.

The system is subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. The control law is developed based on a simplified dynamic model. The adaptive neural network controller is proposed to deal with the unmodelled dynamics in the system and eliminate the need for the error prone process in obtaining the LIP form of the system dynamics. In addition, the time-consuming offline training process for the neural network is avoided. Proportional plus integral feedback control is used for force control for the benefit of real-time implementation.

However, HCCI lacks a direct combustion trigger making control of combustion timing challenging, especially during transients. To aid in HCCI engine control we present a simple model of the HCCI combustion process valid over a range of intake pressures, intake temperatures, equivalence ratios, and engine speeds. The model provides an estimate of the combustion timing on a cycle-by-cycle basis. An ignition threshold, which is a function of the in-cylinder motored temperature and pressure is used to predict start of combustion. This model allows the synthesis of nonlinear control laws, which can be utilized for control of an HCCI engine during transients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4777020/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A simple HCCI engine model for control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple HCCI engine model for control","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-01312009-00433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049986S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4768844","isNumber":"4776587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768844","citationCount":"1071","xplore-issue":"4776587","articleId":"4777020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4777034,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.M. van Lierop","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Control Systems group, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"C.M.M.","lastName":"van Lierop","id":"37564593500"},{"name":"J.W.

First, we consider the case of a recurrent neural network trained directly on a DP solution, whether discrete- or continuous-valued. We show that close approximations of DP solutions are possible with neural networks, acting as feedback controller. Second, we discuss an iterative procedure which allows neurocontrollers to approximate DP solutions indirectly.

Numerical analysis and computer simulation suggest that the scheme greatly increase the probability of detection and reduce the node number to participate in decision fusion.","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2009.52","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4777289/4777290/04777338.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2009.52","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","startPage":"212","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based on SNR Comparison in Fusion Center for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based on SNR Comparison in Fusion Center for Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777338/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10519942","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based on SNR Comparison in Fusion Center for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3516a212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062612S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4777289","isNumber":"4777290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4777289","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4777290","articleId":"4777338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4777364,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In contrast to a feed forward ANN structure i.e. a multilayer perceptron (MLP), the FLANN is basically a single layer structure in which non-linearity is introduced by enhancing the input pattern with nonlinear function expansion. In this work three different expansions is applied. With the proper choice of functional expansion in a FLANN , this network performs as good as and in some case even better than the MLP structure for the problem of denoising of an image corrupted with Gaussian noise. In the single layer functional link ANN (FLANN) the need of hidden layer is eliminated. The novelty of this structure is that it requires much less computation than that of MLP. In the presence of additive white Gaussian noise in the image, the performance of the proposed network is found superior to that of a MLP .In particular FLANN structure with exponential function expansion works best for Gaussian noise suppression from an image.","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2009.120","pdfPath":"/iel5/4777289/4777290/04777366.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2009.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential Functional Link Artificial Neural Networks for Denoising of Image Corrupted by Gaussian Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Functional Link Artificial Neural Networks for Denoising of Image Corrupted by Gaussian Noise","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10518139","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4777366/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Functional Link Artificial Neural Networks for Denoising of Image Corrupted by Gaussian Noise","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3516a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058404S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4777289","isNumber":"4777290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4777289","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4777290","articleId":"4777366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4777367,"authors":[{"name":"Haiyan Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Haiyan","lastName":"Li","id":"37407157900"},{"name":"Dan Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404214700"},{"name":"Rong Zong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zong","id":"37664059700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3516-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3330-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4777367","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Image recognition","Lighting","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Probes","Image databases","Spatial databases","Principal component analysis","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","neural nets","principal component analysis","support vector machines","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","unit-linking PCNN time signature","pulse coupled neural network","2D image","AT&T face database","principal component analysis","Euclidean distance","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pupse Coupled Neural Network","Unit-linking PCNN","PCNN time signature","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel method is proposed for face recognition based on pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) time signature. In this approach, a probe face is first extracted PCNN time signature as the recognition features, which a two-dimensional image is projected to a low one-dimensional feature space and then is classified based on the known samples. An extensive experimental investigation is conducted using AT&T face database covering face recognition under controlled/ideal conditions, different illumination conditions and different facial expressions. The recognition ratio is 83.75% when only PCNN time signature, including 5 features is used as the recognition features and three exemplar images per person are available. The recognition ratio is 94.50% when the PCNN time signature is integrated with PCA feature based on Euclidean distance. The recognition ratio is 98.50% when the PCNN time signature is integrated with ICA feature based on support vector machine (SVM). The simulation result demonstrates that proposed recognition method is robust due to the translation, rotation and scale invariance of PCNN time signature, insensitive to illumination and facial expressions changes as well as fast due to the low feature dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2009.60","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4777289/4777290/04777367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2009.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777290","startPage":"360","endPage":"364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Unit-Linking PCNN Time Signature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Based on Unit-Linking PCNN Time Signature","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10519342","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4777367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Based on Unit-Linking PCNN Time Signature","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3516a360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073371S","chronDate":"22-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4777289","isNumber":"4777290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4777289","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4777290","articleId":"4777367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4777388,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Zhang","firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xiexian Zhong","affiliation":["Institute of Personal Communication/ Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Communication, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiexian","lastName":"Zhong","id":"38188313100"},{"name":"Jing-jing Wang","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, Chongqing, CN"],"firstName":"Jing-jing","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3516-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3330-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4777388","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Channel state information","Transmitters","State feedback","Channel estimation","Interference","Analytical models","Degradation","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MIMO communication","optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO communication system","robust precoding","partial channel state information feedback","ZF criterion","feedback error","MIMO-TD-SCDMA system","robust optimization"]}],"abstract":"In realistic MIMO communication system, the receiver has usually perfect channel state information (CSI), while the transmitter has only partial channel state information feedback from the receiver for many reasons.

ACAP is able to assign different important substreams to corresponding subchannels with different qualities of MIMO in terms of estimated subchannel state information based on a training preamble.

There are many Image Fusion techniques based on signal, pixel, feature and symbol level fusion. Genetic Algorithms (GA's) are used for solving optimization problems. GA can be employed to image fusion where some kind of parameter optimization is required. In this paper, an existing and three novel image fusion algorithms which use GA's are presented. The experimental results have shown that GA based image fusion algorithms outperform the existing image fusion algorithms. GA based image fusion methods are time consuming, so they cannot be adopted in real time applications, however they can be very helpful in static image fusion applications (e.g. concealed weapon detection, medical imaging, remote sensing, weather forecasting etc).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777465/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10681142","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777465/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms and its application to image fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms and its application to image fusion","confLoc":"Rawalpindi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"SPI-02032009-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050928S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4772094","isNumber":"4777454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4772094","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4777454","articleId":"4777465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4777475,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A more practical solution to extending the high availability range is to back-up the FSO link with a lower data rate radio frequency (RF) link. This hybrid FSO/RF system would extend the 99.999% link range to longer distances and open up a much larger metro/access market to the carriers. However, the atmospheric turbulence is the major limiting factor in these types of systems. The use of the optimal adaptive optics (AO) systems is investigated for mitigation of turbulence effects in the Hybrid RF-FSO systems. We develop the efficient analysis and simulation tools for modeling the highly random, turbulence degraded optical channel. Kolmogorov phase screen models are used to generate realistic aperture plane distributions and calculations and prediction of laser beam parameters. Optical adaptive optics system is used at the receiver end. It is shown that the use of adaptive optics greatly improves the performance of the hybrid receiver by reducing the scintillations induced errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777475/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777475/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10471463","conferenceDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of optimal Adaptive Optics system for Hybrid RF-wireless optical communication for maximum efficiency and reliability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of optimal Adaptive Optics system for Hybrid RF-wireless optical communication for maximum efficiency and reliability","confLoc":"Rawalpindi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"SPI-02032009-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079351S","chronDate":"18-19 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4772094","isNumber":"4777454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4772094","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4777454","articleId":"4777475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4777476,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Rashtchi","affiliation":["Technical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Rashtchi","id":"37567784700"},{"name":"Amir Bagheri","affiliation":["Technical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Bagheri","id":"37845417800"},{"name":"Arash Shabani","affiliation":["Technical Engineering Department, Zanjan University, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Shabani","id":"37665858000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2210-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2211-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4777476","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Particle measurements","Current transformers","Particle swarm optimization","Transformer cores","Magnetic cores","Design engineering","Electrical resistance measurement","Wire","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current transformers","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement-type current transformer","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["current transformer","particle swarm optimization","phase displacement error","ratio error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777476","abstract":"In this paper a new approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for measurement-type current transformer design has been proposed.

Over the last decade the method is being adopted throughout the research community around the world. With the advent of the high speed processing units, the method has been emerging from offline rendering towards real time rendering. The success behind ray tracing algorithms lies in the use of acceleration data structures and modern processing power of CPUs and GPUs. kd-tree is one of the most widely used data structures based on surface area heuristics (SAH). The major bottleneck in kd-tree construction is the time consumed to find optimum split locations. In this paper, we propose a prediction algorithm for animated ray tracing based on Kalman filtering. The algorithm successfully predicts the split locations for the next consecutive frame in the animation sequence. Thus, giving good initial starting points for one dimensional search algorithms to find optimum split locations - in our case parabolic interpolation combined with golden section search.

It is assumed that there is a common message (message 1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message (message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode messages 1 and 2, while the non cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only message 1. Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the equivocation rate. In this paper, a single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is obtained.

Our codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of quasi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels for any fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding. We provide constructions of trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes that are endowed with good packing and shaping properties. Both short-block and trellis constructions allow for a reduced complexity decoding algorithm based on minimum mean-squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding and a combination of this with a Viterbi TCM decoder for the TCM case.

A parallel relay network with noise correlation is considered in this network. For the relay strategy of amplify and forward (AF), the optimal rate maximizing relay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays are determined. Interestingly, it is shown that, on average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the relays know the noise covariance matrix. However, the knowledge of correlation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance improvement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the number of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of canceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of relays. For a two-hop multiple-access parallel network, closed-form expressions for the maximum sum rate and the optimal relay strategy are determined. Relay optimization for networks with three hops is also considered. Based on the result of two-hop network with noise correlation, an iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the relay optimization problem for three-hop networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Noise Correlation in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2009826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4777616/04777630.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2009826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777616","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Noise Correlation in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4777630/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10471110","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Noise Correlation in Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"55tit02-kgomadam-2009826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112922S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4777616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4777616","articleId":"4777630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4777632,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Lifeng Lai (M'07) received the B.E. and M.

More specifically, message authentication over noisy channels is studied while impersonation and substitution attacks are investigated for both single- and multiple-message scenarios. For each scenario, information-theoretic lower and upper bounds on the opponent's success, or cheating, probability are derived. Remarkably, in both scenarios, the lower and upper bounds are shown to match, and hence, the fundamental limits on message authentication over noisy channels are fully characterized. The opponent's success probability is further shown to be smaller than that derived in the classical noiseless channel model. These results rely on a novel authentication scheme in which shared key information is used to provide simultaneous protection against both types of attacks.

The channels we consider can have a finite number of states, such as partial response channels, or they can have an infinite state space, such as time-varying fading channels. We optimize recently proposed information rate bounds for such channels, which make use of auxiliary finite-state machine channels (FSMCs). Our main contribution in this paper is to provide iterative expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithms to optimize the parameters of the auxiliary FSMC to tighten these bounds. We provide an explicit, iterative algorithm that improves the upper bound at each iteration. We also provide an effective method for iteratively optimizing the lower bound. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we provide several examples of partial response and fading channels where the proposed optimization techniques significantly tighten the initial upper and lower bounds. Finally, we compare our results with results obtained by the conjugate gradient optimization algorithm and an improved variation of the simplex algorithm, called Soblex. While the computational complexities of our algorithms are similar to the conjugate gradient method and less than the Soblex algorithm, our algorithms robustly find the tightest bounds. Interestingly, from a channel coding/decoding perspective, optimizing the lower bound is related to increasing the achievable mismatched information rate, i.e., the information rate of a communication system where the decoder at the receiver is matched to the auxiliary channel, and not to the original channel.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information rates","Iterative algorithms","Upper bound","Fading","Decoding","Partial response channels","State-space methods","Optimization methods","Computational complexity","Gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","optimisation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information rate upper bound","information rate lower bounds","memory","ergodic discrete-time channels","partial response channels","infinite state space","time-varying fading channels","finite-state machine channels","iterative expectation-maximization type algorithms","partial response","optimization techniques","conjugate gradient optimization algorithm","Soblex","computational complexities","channel coding-decoding perspective","mismatched information rate","communication system information rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-state machine channels","information rate","lower bounds","mismatched decoding","optimization","stationary and ergodic channels","upper bounds"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2009581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4777616/04777638.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2009581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Information Rate Upper and Lower Bounds for Channels With Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Information Rate Upper and Lower Bounds for Channels With Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777638/","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777638/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10471114","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Information Rate Upper and Lower Bounds for Channels With Memory","sourcePdf":"55tit02-psadeghi-2009581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129003S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4777616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4777616","articleId":"4777638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4777641,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond W.

The bound combines and improves existing genie-aided methods and is shown to give the sum-rate capacity for noisy interference as defined in this paper. Specifically, it is shown that if the channel crosstalk coefficient magnitudes lie below thresholds defined by the power constraints then single-user detection at each receiver is sum-rate optimal, i.e., treating the interference as noise incurs no loss in performance. This is the first capacity result for the Gaussian interference channel with weak to moderate interference.

On the other hand, the DSTM also needs a recursive memory of a matrix block at the encoder and therefore provides a trellis structure when the channel information is known at the receiver, which is the interest of this paper. This recursive structure of the DSTM has been adopted lately by Schlegel and Grant in joint with a conventional binary code and joint iterative decoding/demodulation with a superior performance. The number of states of the trellis from the recursive structure depends on both the memory size, which is fixed in this case, and the unitary space-time code (USTC). When a USTC for the DSTM forms a group, the number of states is the same as the size of the USTC, otherwise the number of the states is the size of the semi-group generated by the USTC from all the multiplications of the matrices in the USTC. It is well known in the conventional convolutional coding (CC) or the trellis coded modulation (TCM), the free (Hamming or Euclidean) distance (or the performance) increases when the number of states increases by adding more memory with a properly designed CC or TCM. In this paper, we systematically study and design the USTC/DSTM for the recursive space-time trellis modulation and show that the diversity product increases when the number of states increases, which is not because of the memory size but because of the different USTC designs that generate different sizes of semi-groups. We propose a new USTC design criterion to ensure that the trellis structure improves the diversity product over the USTC as a block code. Based on the new criterion, we propose a new class of USTC design for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas that has an analytical diversity product formula for two transmit antennas. We then follow Schlegel and Grant's approach for joint encoding and iterative decoding of a binary coded DSTM (turbo space-time coding) and numerically show that our new USTC designs for the recursive space-time trellis modulation outperforms the group USTC used by Schlegel and Grant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4777651/","accessionNumber":"10471135","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Space\u2013Time Trellis Codes Using Differential Encoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Space\u2013Time Trellis Codes Using Differential Encoding","sourcePdf":"55tit02-xxia-2009854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134236S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4777616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4777616","articleId":"4777651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4777652,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwu Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yanwu Ding received the B.Eng. degree (with honors) from Southwest Jiantong University, Chengdu, China, in 1985, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2001 and 2007, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","She was a recipient of National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-Graduate Scholarship.

The relay nodes assist the transmission from the source node to the destination. Since the channel matrices for the cooperative systems involve product of Gaussian random variables, which are no longer Gaussian, the approach in obtaining the ergodic channel capacity for conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian channels (Telatar, 1999) is not applicable. By using a novel approach, we have arrived at the following conclusions about the ergodic channel capacities for the AF cooperative systems. For the single antenna AF relay systems in which all nodes are equipped with one antenna, the optimal covariance matrix of the input signals to achieve the ergodic channel capacity is diagonal, and the diagonal elements are obtained by solving optimization problems of multidimensional integrals. These diagonal entries are not all equal even if all the channel gains in the cooperative systems are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian with unit variance. Therefore, a white input signal for the AF cooperative system may not achieve the ergodic channel capacity of the system. This is in direct contrast to the case of conventional multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems having i.i.d. Gaussian channel gains of unit variance, in which case, the ergodic capacity is achieved if the input covariance matrix is a scaled identity matrix. For the MIMO relay system in which the nodes have multiple antennas, the input covariance matrix to achieve the ergodic capacity is block diagonal and each block diagonalizes the autocorrelation of channel matrix from the source to the destination. This is different from the case of conventional MIMO systems, where the input covariance matrix to achieve the ergodic channel capacity diagonalizes the channel autocorrelation matrix of the MIMO system (Tulina, Lozano, and Verdu, 2006). If the channel gains in conventional MIMO systems are correlated Gaussian random variables, the input covariance matrix is a full matrix, not block diagonal; and if the channel gains are i.i.d. Gaussians, the optimal input covariance matrix is a scaled identity. The observations obtained in this paper reveal useful insights of how the AF cooperative systems ldquomimicrdquo the conventional MISO and MIMO systems from the ergodic channel capacity perspective.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2009822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4777616/04777652.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2009822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic Channel Capacities for the Amplify-and-Forward Half-Duplex Cooperative Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777652/","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic Channel Capacities for the Amplify-and-Forward Half-Duplex Cooperative Systems","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10471120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777652/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic Channel Capacities for the Amplify-and-Forward Half-Duplex Cooperative Systems","sourcePdf":"55tit02-yding-2009822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10843S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4777616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4777616","articleId":"4777652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4777653,"authors":[{"name":"Ezio Biglieri","affiliation":["Departament de Tecnologies de la Informaci\u00f3i les Comunicacions,DTIC-UPF, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Ezio Biglieri (M'73\u2013SM'82\u2013F'89) was born in Aosta (Italy).

Therefore, a very desirable feature of WSN would be its rechargability to remain operational over longer period of times. However, the nodes needing recharge may not be accessible. In this paper, we present a battery recharge model in WSNs for inaccessible or hard to access environments, at distances up to several hundred meters, using variable power Infrared (IR) laser. While bulk of the sensor network comprises of sensing nodes, the juncture nodes are the ones that relay data towards sink -resulting into faster battery depletion. We present a recharge mechanism for juncture nodes, that utilizes Free Space Optics (FSO) over RF-cliques using IR-laser, Corner Cube Retroreflectors (CCRs) and beam-steering lasers. A Thinfilm Corner Cube Retroreflector (TCCR) is also proposed as a variant to the standard CCR to realize selective recharging. The proposed mechanism provides recharge-ability both for on-demand recharging and scheduled recharging.","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777748","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4770546/4777689/04777748.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A battery recharge model for WSNs using Free-Space Optics (FSO)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777748/","displayDocTitle":"A battery recharge model for WSNs using Free-Space Optics (FSO)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10471394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777748/","conferenceDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A battery recharge model for WSNs using Free-Space Optics (FSO)","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"orig_res_(52).pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067785S","chronDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4770546","isNumber":"4777689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4770546","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4777689","articleId":"4777748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4777754,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfa Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Wenfa Li","id":"37834069000"},{"name":"Miyi Duan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Miyi Duan","id":"37062452700"},{"name":"You Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"You Chen","id":"37293320300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2823-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2824-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4777754","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Machine learning algorithms","Support vector machines","Data mining","Robustness","Testing","Clustering algorithms","Information security","Computer vision","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern recognition","security of data","support vector machines","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","MRMHC-SVM algorithm","intrusion detection","high false alarm rate","normal patterns modeling","MRMHC-SVM machine learning","feature selection","dimensionality curse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network security","Anomaly detection","MRMHC-SVM algorithm","Feature selection"]}],"abstract":"Network anomaly detection is the major direction of research in intrusion detection.

Optimal reduction in Distance Measurement Error (DME) is achieved. We have utilized OFDM/SC-DFE signal structure presented in our previous works. Three super resolution algorithms i.e. Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT), Root-Multiple Signal Classification (RootMUSIC) and Matrix Pencil (MP) are being compared for DME estimation. We have applied Minimum Descriptive Length (MDL) criteria to these algorithms, that provides optimize estimate of the length of actual CIR by eliminating the noise component from the dispersive CIR. Our scheme is based on two different antennas used to transmit the pre-half-zero-carriers and post-half-zero-carriers OFDM symbols respectively, mapped to multiple carriers using Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) system and received by a single to be positioned object. An analysis of DME estimation is presented for varying Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). DME reduction approaching to zero is achieved by the MP algorithm using our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777779","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4770546/4777689/04777779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777689","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Difference of Arrival estimation using super resolution algorithms to minimize Distance Measurement Error for indoor positioning systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time Difference of Arrival estimation using super resolution algorithms to minimize Distance Measurement Error for indoor positioning systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777779/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10471425","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4777779/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Difference of Arrival estimation using super resolution algorithms to minimize Distance Measurement Error for indoor positioning systems","confLoc":"Karachi, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"orig_res_(83).pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09883S","chronDate":"23-24 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4770546","isNumber":"4777689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4770546","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4777689","articleId":"4777779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4777788,"authors":[{"name":"Atif Ali","affiliation":["National Engineering and Scientific Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Atif","lastName":"Ali","id":"38187075900"},{"name":"Wang Qing","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Qing","id":"37087488360"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2823-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2824-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4777788","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777788","abstract":"The challenging task of designing an auto pilot for non linear time varying flexible flight vehicle system under conflicting design requirements requires a gain scheduled controller throughout the flight.

Generating both from plain text is a straightforward task for English. However, it is quite challenging for Chinese, Japanese, or Thai which provide no word segmentation, i.e. the text has no word boundary delimiter. For Thai word segmentation, maximal matching, a lexicon-based approach, is one of the popular methods. Nevertheless this method heavily relies on the coverage of the lexicon. When text contains an unknown word, this method usually produces a wrong boundary. When extracting words from this segmented text, some words will not be retrieved because of wrong segmentation. In this paper, we propose statistical techniques to tackle this problem. Based on different word segmentation methods we develop various speech translation systems and show that the proposed method can significantly improve the translation accuracy by about 6.42% BLEU points compared to the baseline system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving word segmentation for Thai speech translation","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2008.4777885","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4768845/4777819/04777885.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2008.4777885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4777819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4777885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4777885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improving word segmentation for Thai speech translation","conferenceDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4777885/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10478415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving word segmentation for Thai speech translation","confLoc":"Goa, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-02022009-00066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039716S","chronDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4768845","isNumber":"4777819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4768845","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4777819","articleId":"4777885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4777891,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Many task computing differs from high throughput computing in the emphasis of using large number of computing resources over short periods of time to accomplish many computational tasks (i.e. including both dependent and independent tasks), where primary metrics are measured in seconds (e.g. FLOPS, tasks/sec, MB/s I/O rates), as opposed to operations (e.g. jobs) per month. Many task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. Tasks may be small or large, uniprocessor or multiprocessor, compute-intensive or data-intensive.

The deregulation of energy has lowered the investment in larger power plants, which means the need for new electrical power sources may be very high in the near future. Two major technologies will play important roles to solve the future problems. One is to change the electrical power production sources from the conventional, fossil (and short term) based energy sources to renewable energy resources. The other is to use high efficient power electronics in power systems, power production and end-user application.

Several well known DC/DC converters can be used to transform the varying fuel cell voltage to the requested amplitude of the dc-link-voltage. Besides transformerless converters like the boost converter, converters with high frequency transformers can be used. In the considered higher power range, the full-bridge converter circuit is the appropriate solution. Depending on their input circuit, the converters are classified between voltage fed and current fed full bridge converter. In this paper, full bridge converters of the voltage type and of the current type as active front end for fuel cell inverters in the power range of 20 kW and higher are analysed and compared to each other.

Many variants of the MCCC topology have been introduced over years. Mostly, only integer DC voltage ratios between the cascaded converter cells have been applied to its PWM modulation. This is mainly due to the non-uniform distribution of voltage vectors with the non-integer DC ratios. It poses difficulty to the conventional SVM modulators relying on locating the equilateral \"triangle\" made of three nearest vectors enclosing the reference vector. In this paper, an original modulation method is introduced to operate with any DC voltage ratio between cascaded converter cells, integer or non-integer; and even with a dynamically varying ratio; while the normal PWM output fast-average is not disrupted. The space vector analysis and the detailed simulations verify the modulation method. The new concept of MCCC PWM with non-integer DC voltage ratio offers great flexibility in its practical operation, particularly in MCCC with single DC source where the auxiliary inverter cell DC-link capacitor voltage can be regulated at arbitrary value online.

The gate driver for each power semiconductor requires its own floating or isolated DC voltage source. Traditional methods on meeting the requirement are expensive and bulky. This paper presents a gate driver design for floating voltage source type multilevel inverters. Bootstrap capacitors are used to form the floating voltage sources in the design, which allows a single DC power supply to be used by all the gate drivers. Specially configured diode plus the proper charging cycles maintain adequate capacitor voltage levels. Such a simple and low cost solution allows user to utilize the easy accessible single-channel gate drivers for multilevel inverter applications without the extra cost on the bulky isolated DC power supplies for each gate driver.

The target of the power converter controller using a PT, with 2.3 mm thickness and 17 mm diameter at frequency of 155-175 kHz, designed in a resonant circuit of class-E topology, is to maintain a constant output current of 290 mA/DC with variable output voltage drop at wide input voltage range of 85-250 V/AC. Also, the ZVS (zero-voltage-switching) condition is achieved over the full operation range. The used 1200 V fieldstop IGBT (1A-Type) shows losses around 200 mW over the full operating range for constant output current. The paper shows the regulation method for off-line power supplies using PT in class-E topology in constant current mode regulation (CCMR). The regulation algorithm has been programmed in C language operated by a 32-bit DSP (TMS320F2812). Besides, in the class-E application, the duty cycle of the switching frequency needs to be controlled in order to achieve the ZVS during the operation at different load and input condition. This goal is achievable only by phase locked loop (PLL) feedback in a satisfying way. To solve this problem, the idea of PT with an auxiliary tap has been applied. The application is suited for low size LED line adapters, to be integrated in bulb sockets. The results are applicable for any controller design of resonant PT step-down topologies. The several suited optimum control concept is investigated in this paper, considering the circuit expense being minimized","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2006.4778164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2006.4778164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778077","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 CES/IEEE 5th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4777932/4778077/04778164.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 CES/IEEE 5th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778164","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","LED lamps","Transformers","Power supplies","Circuit topology","Zero voltage switching","Phase locked loops","Driver circuits","Analog-digital conversion","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","driver circuits","electric current control","LED lamps","piezoelectric devices","power engineering computing","power supplies to apparatus","switching convertors","transformers","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED lighting","piezoelectric transformers","class-E topology","power supply LED driver","power converter controller","ZVS","fieldstop IGBT","constant current mode regulation","C programming","32-bit DSP","phase locked loop feedback","adapters","bulb socket","2.3 mm","17 mm","290 mA","85 to 250 V","1200 V","155 to 175 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED","Class-E","Piezoelectric Transformer","Phase Locked Loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Line Power-Supply for LED Lighting using Piezoelectric Transformers in Class-E Topology","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9252906","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4778164/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778164/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Line Power-Supply for LED Lighting using Piezoelectric Transformers in Class-E Topology","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"IPEMC-2-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051353S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4777932","isNumber":"4778077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4777932","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4778077","articleId":"4778164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4778177,"authors":[{"name":"Haibing Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Haibing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37292019000"},{"name":"Tianjun Jin","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tianjun","lastName":"Jin","id":"38186986900"},{"name":"Xianmiao Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianmiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38189645800"},{"name":"Zhengyu Lu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37277025100"},{"name":"Zhaoming Qian","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoming","lastName":"Qian","id":"37277089400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0448-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4778177","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":622},"abstract":"A configurable floating-point coprocessor by a FPGA is designed to enhance the computational capability of the digital platform based on the fixed-point DSP, with which the platform will be competent to implement intensively computational tasks.

consider variations of circuit element values for power electronic converter design to satisfy a given specification for a frequency characteristic or a dynamic transient response because the variations of element values generate those of the designed characteristic. Therefore element values and their variation ranges should be designed to give a satisfactory characteristic within an allowable specification range or a tolerance. This analysis is so-called tolerance or worst-case analysis. The analysis is a sort of nonlinear minimum and maximum (min/max) problem with respect to circuit parameters. However its computation cost is large and practically the problem is converted to a simpler and easier one with various techniques. This paper proposes an approximate method which finds a quasi-min/max solution by applying the genetic algorithm (GA). According to the GA, the higher the fitness value is, the more likely the genetic code remains.

At the very beginning, we initialize a preliminary power supply design with a known topology (e.g. Fly-back). Then, we choose a set of alternative parts for some critical components such as the MOSFET and transformer. It is quite a complicated and time consuming task to obtain a design with the highest efficiency and lowest cost from numerous combinations. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is one generic solution to solve such optimization problems. In order to encode the electrical parts as the basic units of GA, the chromosomes, and evaluate them with a numerical function, we have to model an entire power supply circuits into a component-based system and simulate the electrical reactions by the numerical characteristics of components. This approach not only reduces the time in the design stage but provide a more convincing design before the production.

Firstly, the topology and operation principle of the machine are presented. Secondly, the apparent (static) and incremental (dynamic) inductances are defined. Then, the conventional calculation method of transforming the 3-phase inductances in stator frame into d/q-axes rotor frame is performed, which consumes lots of time. To avoid it, a newly simplified and fast method is proposed to obtain the d-axis and q-axis inductances directly and accurately at only two special rotor positions.

This paper presents a neural network method with currents difference as its inputs and the rotor position angle as its outputs. 256 different 100mus-width voltage vector pulse pairs injects into stator before position calculation. The voltage vector direction distributes symmetrically around an electrical cycle. So 256 current pairs can be obtained. Because of the saturation of the stator, the positive and negative vector pulses have different current responses. 256 current difference data can be got. As there's much noise in the data a neural network is introduced. 256 current difference data are used as the inputs of the neural network, and the electrical angle the rotor position is the outputs. A direct torque controlled (DTC) PMSM experimental system with the proposed initial position detecting method is set up. The scheme is verified by the experimental system with a 600w PMSM.

Event-driven control approach determines the transistor switching pattern directly from the current error logic signals and is designed using a novel matrix based approach for the description of the discrete event systems. A new approach for description of event-driven systems is introduced. It is based on matrix description of Petri Nets, supplemented with a combination of logic and algebraic equations. The control algorithms designed by proposed approach can be easily implemented on modern DSP an FPGA devices. The approach is illustrated with the design of direct current controller for a three phase inverter fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine and is examined with simulations and experimentally confirmed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 12th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4778359/4778360/04778407.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"2006 12th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/EPEPEMC.2006.4778407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEPEMC.2006.4778407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Discrete Event Current Control Strategy for a Three Phase Inverter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Current control","Inverters","Control systems","Error correction","Logic design","Signal design","Discrete event systems","Petri nets","Logic devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Based Discrete Event Current Control Strategy for a Three Phase Inverter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4778407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Based Discrete Event Current Control Strategy for a Three Phase Inverter","confLoc":"Portoroz, Slovenia","sourcePdf":"EPEPEMC-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05435S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4778359","isNumber":"4778360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4778359","xplore-issue":"4778360","articleId":"4778407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4778465,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Karall","affiliation":["Institute of Designing in Plastics and Composite Materials, University of Leoben, Leoben, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Karall","id":"38188892100"},{"name":"Helmut Weiss","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, University of Leoben, Leoben, Austria"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37427829300"},{"name":"Rudolf Woerndle","affiliation":["Institute of Designing in Plastics and Composite Materials, University of Leoben, Leoben, Austria"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Woerndle","id":"37937334900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0121-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4778465","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778465","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind energy","Rotors","Blades","Stress","Damping","Power generation","Wind energy generation","Torque control","Renewable energy resources","Power system economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blades","electric generators","machine control","rotors","torque control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind power","rotor blade","stress minimisation","active damping","generator torque control","renewable energy generation","centrifugal force","power transmission force"]}],"abstract":"Renewable energy generation strongly relies on wind power aside from water power plants.

This is especially true, for example, when the data are known to contain strong nonlinearities, such as in the reflectance data obtained from hyperspectral imaging sensors over the water, where the medium itself is attenuating. These representations are also potentially useful in such applications as anomaly finding. A number of other researchers have looked at different aspects of the manifold coordinate representations such as the best way to exploit these representations through the backend classifier, while others have examined alternative manifold coordinate models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Estimation of Spectral Neighborhood Size in Manifold Coordinate Representations of Hyperspectral Imagery: Implications for Anomaly Finding, Bathymetry Retrieval, and Land Applications","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778791","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778767/04778791.pdf","startPage":"I-56","endPage":"I-57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automated Estimation of Spectral Neighborhood Size in Manifold Coordinate Representations of Hyperspectral Imagery: Implications for Anomaly Finding, Bathymetry Retrieval, and Land Applications","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4778791/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10445145","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Estimation of Spectral Neighborhood Size in Manifold Coordinate Representations of Hyperspectral Imagery: Implications for Anomaly Finding, Bathymetry Retrieval, and Land Applications","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-1-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042173S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4778767","articleId":"4778791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4778808,"authors":[{"name":"William J.

The present work focuses on the cloud impact on the AIRS and IASI radiances and explores the use of the stochastic cloud clearing methodology together with neural network estimation. A stand-alone statistical algorithm will be presented that operates directly on cloud-impacted AIRS/AMSU and IASI/AMSU data, with no need for a physical cloud clearing process. The performance of this method was evaluated using global (ascending and descending) EOS-Aqua orbits collocated with ECMWF fields for a variety of days throughout 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Over 1,000,000 fields of regard (3\u00d73 arrays of footprints) over ocean and land were used in the study. The method requires significantly less computation than traditional variational retrieval methods, while achieving comparable performance. Retrieval accuracy will be evaluated using ECMWF atmospheric fields as ground truth. The accuracy of the neural network retrieval method will be compared to the accuracy of the AIRS Level 2 (Version 5) retrieval method.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778808","startPage":"I-122","endPage":"I-125","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778767","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778767/04778808.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Estimation of Atmospheric Profiles Using AIRS/IASI/AMSU Data in the Presence of Clouds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778808/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Estimation of Atmospheric Profiles Using AIRS/IASI/AMSU Data in the Presence of Clouds","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4778808/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10445159","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Estimation of Atmospheric Profiles Using AIRS/IASI/AMSU Data in the Presence of Clouds","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-1-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04239S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4778767","articleId":"4778808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4778834,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Argenti","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universita di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Argenti","id":"37266590100"},{"name":"Tiziano Bianchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universita di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Tiziano","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37269910100"},{"name":"Giovanni Martucci di Scarfizzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universita di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni Martucci","lastName":"di Scarfizzi","id":"38093287500"},{"name":"Luciano Alparone","affiliation":["Dipartimento Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universita di Firenze, Firenze, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Alparone","id":"37272265700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4778834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778834","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an extension of two despeckling algorithms, proposed to denoise SAR images and based on the undecimated separable wavelet transform, to work with the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT).

In particular, many new multiscale image representations in a geometric space have been proposed (Curvelets, Ridgelets, Contourlets, etc.). Instead of using a fixed transformation, an alternative approach is to build a sparse dictionary from the signal itself. In the present work, we propose a novel approach for speckle noise reduction in SAR images using a sparse and redundant representation over trained dictionaries. In this approach, an adaptive dictionary composed of image patches (called atoms) is learned from the image so that it constitutes a sparse representation of the image content. This learning process, called K-SVD, is efficiently performed using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This new approach is effective in removing white additive Gaussian noise despite the fact that elements of the dictionary are learned from the noisy image, the algorithm is converging toward meaningful atoms that are already showing a reduction in noise level.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Dictionaries","Matching pursuit algorithms","Noise reduction","Gaussian noise","Noise level","Image representation","Speckle","Singular value decomposition","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image representation","remote sensing by radar","singular value decomposition","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","SAR image filtering","learned dictionaries","multiscale image representations","geometric space","fixed transformation","speckle noise reduction","adaptive dictionary","image patches","image content","learning process","K-SVD","Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","Singular Value Decomposition","additive Gaussian noise","atoms","Contourlets","Ridgelets","Curvelets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K-SVD","speckle filtering","SAR"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778835","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778767/04778835.pdf","startPage":"I-229","endPage":"I-232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Image Filtering Via Learned Dictionaries and Sparse Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAR Image Filtering Via Learned Dictionaries and Sparse Representations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778835/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4778835/","accessionNumber":"10445184","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Image Filtering Via Learned Dictionaries and Sparse Representations","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-1-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061353S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4778767","articleId":"4778835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4778837,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Cerra","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center DLR, Remote Sensing Technology Institute, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Cerra","id":"37322417500"},{"name":"Mihai Datcu","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Datcu","id":"37265637100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4778837","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image classification","Indexing","Data compression","Image analysis","Earth","Data models","Radiometry","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image classification","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image indexing","data compression based techniques","Earth Observation imagery","data models","scene resolution","sensor type"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Compression","Data Mining","Kolmogorov Complexity","Image classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes complexity based analysis as a valid alternative to classic image analysis methodologies for Earth Observation imagery, which are heavily dependant on the assumed data models.

Thus, targets with constant acceleration will undergo full motion compensation and their point-scatterers will each be localized. It should be noted that the source of the quadratic term can come from not only acceleration, but also non-uniform rotational motion and the cosine term in wide-angle imaging. The method is also computationally simple, requiring only slight modifications to the existing Fourier transform-based algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778919","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04778919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","startPage":"II-29","endPage":"II-32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"S-Method-Based Approach for Image Formation, Motion Compensation, and Image Enhancement of Moving Targerts in ISAR and SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"S-Method-Based Approach for Image Formation, Motion Compensation, and Image Enhancement of Moving Targerts in ISAR and SAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10445250","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4778919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"S-Method-Based Approach for Image Formation, Motion Compensation, and Image Enhancement of Moving Targerts in ISAR and SAR","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-2-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04452S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4778902","articleId":"4778919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4778941,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Adam","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Adam","id":"38505870100"},{"name":"Michael Eineder","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Eineder","id":"37269579900"},{"name":"Nestor Yague-Martinez","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nestor","lastName":"Yague-Martinez","id":"38272336800"},{"name":"Richard Bamler","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Germany","Remote Sensing Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bamler","id":"37269413600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4778941","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"abstract":"The German radar satellite TerraSAR-X was launched in June 2007. Radar interferometry (InSAR) is supposed to be one of the major applications of this sensor. It allows the three-dimensional mapping of the Earth's surface (InSAR) or even its displacement effects using differential interferometry (D-InSAR) or the more advanced persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). All InSAR-applications are well-supported by the sensor, the SAR-processor and the mission design. DLRs operational interferometric system PSI-GENESIS has been adapted to cope with the new sensor and the innovative acquisition modes. Interferometric example applications could be shown already in the early stage of the six months commissioning phase.

However, the complex nature of the HR observations, especially when acquired over urban/artificial environments, makes the accurate discrimination of distinct thematic classes a difficult task. In the present paper, a novel technique is proposed for supervised classification of multispectral HR images, that is based on the key-idea to combine the Markov random field (MRF) approach to data fusion with a graph-based approach to image classification in a multiscale strategy. A multiscale segmentation method is adopted in order to jointly exploit the capability to detect large structures in coarse-scale observations and to refine the identification of spatial details in fine-scale observations. Then, a novel MRF model is proposed that fuses the information conveyed by the segmentation maps at all scales and by the spatial neighborhood of each pixel. The method is validated by experiments on spaceborne and airborne HR images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of High-Resolution Images Based on MRF Fusion and Multiscale Segmentation","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778981","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04778981.pdf","startPage":"II-277","endPage":"II-280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4778981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4778981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Classification of High-Resolution Images Based on MRF Fusion and Multiscale Segmentation","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4778981/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10445302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of High-Resolution Images Based on MRF Fusion and Multiscale Segmentation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-2-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063264S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4778902","articleId":"4778981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4779024,"authors":[{"name":"Othmar Frey","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Laboratories, University of Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Othmar","lastName":"Frey","id":"37402938100"},{"name":"Erich Meier","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Laboratories, University of Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Meier","id":"37269586600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779024","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Array signal processing","Tomography","Focusing","Synthetic aperture radar","Image resolution","Geometry","Azimuth","Remote sensing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","geophysical signal processing","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","time-domain analysis","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Capon beamforming","tomographic SAR processing","Fourier based focusing","time domain back-projection","synthetic aperture radar"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Time-Domain Back-Projection and Capon Beamforming for Tomographic SAR Processing","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","endPage":"II-448","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04779024.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779024","startPage":"II-445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779024","abstract":"Various tomographic processing methods have been investigated in recent years.

Results on synthetic images show that the proposed system exhibits promising performances both in terms of object detection and material recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779044","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04779044.pdf","startPage":"II-525","endPage":"II-528","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection and Classification of Buried Objects in GPR Images Using Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection and Classification of Buried Objects in GPR Images Using Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10445347","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4779044/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection and Classification of Buried Objects in GPR Images Using Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-2-142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041864S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4778902","articleId":"4779044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4779061,"authors":[{"name":"Abel Paz","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Abel","lastName":"Paz","id":"37408663900"},{"name":"Antonio Plaza","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Plaza","id":"37299689800"},{"name":"Soraya Blazquez","affiliation":["Department of Technology of Computers and Communications, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"Soraya","lastName":"Blazquez","id":"37299989900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779061","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Hyperspectral imaging","Partitioning algorithms","Hyperspectral sensors","Object detection","Iterative algorithms","Concurrent computing","Parallel algorithms","Terrorism","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","object detection","parallel algorithms","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithm implementation","target detection algorithm","anomaly detection algorithm","hyperspectral imagery","remote sensing","massively parallel Beowulf cluster","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","AVIRIS sensor","commodity cluster computers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","target detection","parallel processing","commodity cluster computing"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops several parallel algorithms for target detection in hyperspectral imagery, considered to be a crucial goal in many remote sensing applications.

This plays an important role in the prediction of erosion, flood or drought. Passive microwave remote sensing data has great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture. This is mainly due to the minimal weather influence on passive microwave data and its ability to penetrate through clouds. The artificial neural network (ANN) is a method that tries simulates human intelligence by crudely imitating the way a human brain learns. This method has been especially useful for mapping non-linear and ill-posed problems. Soil moisture retrieval is an example of a non-linear problem. An explicit inverse of the physical process can be built using an ANN to map the passive microwave measurements into land surface parameters such as soil moisture. For this paper, the ANN method used to create the explicit inverse function is divided into (i.) single parameter retrieval of the soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements, and (ii.) multi-parameter retrieval of a number of land surface parameters, i.e. soil temperature, surface roughness, together with soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements. This paper examines these methods in the context of retrieving surface soil moisture values given microwave radiometric data and discusses key issues that will need to be addressed to improve mapping performance and to produce operational systems.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779086","startPage":"II-687","endPage":"II-690","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04779086.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit Inverse of Soil Moisture Retrieval with an Artificial Neural Network Using Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779086/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Explicit Inverse of Soil Moisture Retrieval with an Artificial Neural Network Using Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4779086/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10445368","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit Inverse of Soil Moisture Retrieval with an Artificial Neural Network Using Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-2-184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044207S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4778902","articleId":"4779086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4779124,"authors":[{"name":"Samarth Patel","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Samarth","lastName":"Patel","id":"38188287400"},{"name":"Ramprasad Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ramprasad","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37288869200"},{"name":"Avijit Gangopadhyay","affiliation":["School for Marine Science and Technology, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Avijit","lastName":"Gangopadhyay","id":"38117351300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779124","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Shape","Image analysis","Image color analysis","Oceans","Remote sensing","Instruments","Satellites","Sea measurements","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","image processing","neural nets","ocean chemistry","oceanographic regions","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segment oceanic eddy detection","Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor","SeaWiFS satellite","neural network","shape analysis","ocean property analysis","chlorophyll","ocean color observation","ocean feature","circular whirling flow","elliptical whirling flow","mesoscale eddy","coastal ocean","Monterey Bay region","California coast","image processing","USA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy detection","Sea-WiFS","Neural Network","Shape Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779124","abstract":"Key remote sensing instruments like advanced Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) aboard satellites, play a vital role in collecting observations that help in analyzing the properties of oceans around the globe.

An anomaly has distinct spectral features from its neighborhood, whose spectral signature is not known a priori, and it usually has small size with only a few pixels. It is very challenge to detect anomalies, especially without any information of the background environment in hyperspectral data with hundreds of co-registered image bands. Several methods are devoted to this problem, including the well-known RX algorithm which takes advantage of the second-order statistics and other algorithms which detect anomaly based on higher order statistics such as skewness and kurtosis. It has been proved that the High-Order Automatic Anomaly Detection Algorithm can outperform RX algorithm by distinguishing different types of anomalies. However, the initialization of the High-Order Automatic Anomaly Detection Algorithm remains a challenge problem. When the initial vectors are selected randomly for this recursive algorithm, they might be trapped in the local maximums and give different projection directions. But in our experiments, all those directions will show different types of anomalies. Therefore, this algorithm is particular suitable for parallel processing to increase the computing efficiency. In the parallel architecture, we will first randomly generate initial vectors for each process, and then united those output results for the orthogonal projection base. We will also compare the computational efficiency with the number of parallel processes we used.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779170","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4778902/04779170.pdf","startPage":"II-1017","endPage":"II-1020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4778902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Parallel Approach for Initialization of High-Order Statistics Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779170/","displayDocTitle":"A Parallel Approach for Initialization of High-Order Statistics Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10445406","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4779170/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Parallel Approach for Initialization of High-Order Statistics Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-2-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068929S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4778902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4778902","articleId":"4779170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4779289,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The computational complexity depends on the number of bases, i.e. the rank of the factorization, and on the dimensions of the spectral image. In this study we propose sampling methods for the preprocessing phase which enables a faster way to compute the non-negative tensor factorization (NTF). In the preprocessing both sampling and interpolation are applied to the original data. Three approaches are compared: direct sub-sampling, integer wavelet transform, and spectral smoothing. The experiments indicate that the preprocessing can remarkable reduce the time needed for NTF. From the approaches, the integer wavelet transform shows the best performance in computational and quality senses. The computational load from the direct subsampling is the lowest for one iteration, the spectral smoothing is computationally heaviest.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779289","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779256/04779289.pdf","startPage":"III - 87","endPage":"III - 90","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Sampling Methods in Faster Computation of Non-Negative Tensor Factorization of Spectral Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Sampling Methods in Faster Computation of Non-Negative Tensor Factorization of Spectral Images","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4779289/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10460430","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Sampling Methods in Faster Computation of Non-Negative Tensor Factorization of Spectral Images","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-3-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046034S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4779256","articleId":"4779289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4779330,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7 \u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"38323572200"},{"name":"Jose M.

The underlying mixing model is linear; i.e., the mixed hyperspectral vectors are modeled by a linear mixture of the end-member signatures weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions. MVSA approaches hyperspectral unmixing by fitting a minimum volume simplex to the hyperspectral data, constraining the abundance fractions to belong to the probability simplex. The resulting optimization problem is solved by implementing a sequence of quadratically constrained subproblems. In a final step, the hard constraint on the abundance fractions is replaced with a hinge type loss function to account for outliers and noise. We illustrate the state-of-the-art performance of the MVSA algorithm in unmixing simulated data sets. We are mainly concerned with the realistic scenario in which the pure pixel assumption (i.e., there exists at least one pure pixel per end member) is not fulfilled. In these conditions, the MVSA yields much better performance than the pure pixel based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779330","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779256/04779330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779256","startPage":"III - 250","endPage":"III - 253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Volume Simplex Analysis: A Fast Algorithm to Unmix Hyperspectral Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Volume Simplex Analysis: A Fast Algorithm to Unmix Hyperspectral Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779330/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10472413","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4779330/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Volume Simplex Analysis: A Fast Algorithm to Unmix Hyperspectral Data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-3-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073571S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"4779256","articleId":"4779330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4779368,"authors":[{"name":"Martti Hallikainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), Finland"],"firstName":"Martti","lastName":"Hallikainen","id":"37272405900"},{"name":"Panu Lahtinen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), Finland"],"firstName":"Panu","lastName":"Lahtinen","id":"37265545700"},{"name":"Timo Piepponen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Piepponen","id":"37586419900"},{"name":"Lauri Honkavaara","affiliation":["Aalto-yliopisto Insinooritieteiden korkeakoulu, Aalto, FI"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Honkavaara","id":"37087024939"},{"name":"Aleksis Schafer","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), Finland"],"firstName":"Aleksis","lastName":"Schafer","id":"37698434300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779368","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave radiometry","Snow","Land surface temperature","Microwave measurements","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Temperature measurement","Dielectric measurements","Information retrieval","Brightness temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric temperature","land surface temperature","microwaves","polarisation","radiative transfer","radiometry","remote sensing","snow","spaceborne radar","terrestrial electricity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["snow cover terrain","microwave radiometer measurement","snow emission model","snow emission algorithm","spaceborne radiometer data","Kirkkonummi","southern Finland","AD 1985 01 to 04","brightness temperature measurement","snow dielectric property","snow extinction property","polarisation","microwave emission observation","aluminium sheet","water equivalent estimation","surface roughness measurement","ground surface temperature","TKK model","single-layer radiative transfer model","Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks","MEMLS model","radiative multiple-scattering model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779368","abstract":"Ground based multitemporal microwave radiometer to measurement snow covered terrain.

Different baselines, frequency bands and polarimetric channels have been used in order to analyze the potential of this technique for retrieving information about the vertical structure of such a specific crop and, additionally, these observations have been also used for studying the validity of the RVoG and OVoG models. Results obtained show that the PCT profiles exhibit no dependence on polarization, which is in agreement with the clustering effect observed on PolInSAR observables, i.e. coherences for different polarimetric channels are located very close one to another. In the dual-baseline case, the best profile reconstruction is obtained for the highest baseline ratio available (0.25deg and 1deg baselines) when the condition number of the inversion problem is improved by filtering out the fifth coefficient of the Legendre-Fourier expansion. Differences on the reconstructed profiles between linear and Pauli basis are negligible. The application of the triple-and four-baseline approaches without filtering out the last terms of the expansion leads to unstable results, whereas the filtered cases reveal that the contribution of a fourth baseline is null.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779407","startPage":"III - 554","endPage":"III - 557","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779256/04779407.pdf","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Scattering Profiles of a Rice Sample by Means of Polarization Coherence Tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Scattering Profiles of a Rice Sample by Means of Polarization Coherence Tomography","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4779407/","accessionNumber":"10460475","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779407/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Scattering Profiles of a Rice Sample by Means of Polarization Coherence Tomography","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-3-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03886S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4779256","articleId":"4779407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4779432,"authors":[{"name":"Yuliya Tarabalka","affiliation":["University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Yuliya","lastName":"Tarabalka","id":"37396386300"},{"name":"Jocelyn Chanussot","affiliation":["Grenoble Institute of Technology, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Chanussot","id":"37265876800"},{"name":"Jon Atli Benediktsson","affiliation":["University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Jon Atli","lastName":"Benediktsson","id":"38231866900"},{"name":"Jesus Angulo","affiliation":["Paris School of Mines, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jesus","lastName":"Angulo","id":"37397726300"},{"name":"Mathieu Fauvel","affiliation":["Grenoble Institute of Technology, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Fauvel","id":"37396383900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779432","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":521},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Image segmentation","Support vector machines","Hyperspectral sensors","Robustness","Data analysis","Morphology","Pixel","Feature extraction","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image classification","image segmentation","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral data segmentation","hyperspectral data classification","Robust Color Morphological Gradient","watershed transformation","pixel-wise Support Vector Machines","airborne ROSIS image","University of Pavia","Italy","spatial information integration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral images","mathematical morphology","segmentation","classification","watershed"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a new segmentation and classification scheme to analyze hyperspectral (HS) data.

Experimental results with real airborne data confirm the correctness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779560","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779256/04779560.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779256","startPage":"III - 1154","endPage":"III - 1157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation Processing of Airborne SAR Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation Processing of Airborne SAR Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779560/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10478600","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4779560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation Processing of Airborne SAR Data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-3-304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086639S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4779256","articleId":"4779560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4779562,"authors":[{"name":"Keming Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Keming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403997300"},{"name":"Chunlei Huo","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunlei","lastName":"Huo","id":"37408556400"},{"name":"Zhixin Zhou","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37404365500"},{"name":"Hanqing Lu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274984800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779562","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Change detection algorithms","Markov random fields","Minimization methods","Radar detection","Bayesian methods","Remote sensing","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Synthetic aperture radar","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","image processing","Markov processes","minimisation","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised change detection","SAR image","SAR temporal image sets","energy function minimization","priority sequence","Markov random field model","maximum a-posteriori estimates","graph cuts algorithm","iterated conditional modes algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov Random Field (MRF)","SAR","energy minimization","Graph cuts","iterated conditional modes (ICM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779562","abstract":"In this paper, we present an unsupervised change detection approach in temporal sets of SAR images.

Graph cuts algorithm is employed for computing maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimates of the MRF. Experiments results obtained on a SAR data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

It provides a good basis for the inverse problem for defect detection and reconstruction. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method can be used to model nondestructive wave based sensing using air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR). A full 3D model is able to capture all interactions but is limited by computational size and CPU time. In contrast, a 2D model is computationally fast and capable of studying a large computational region, but lacks a complete view of the problem. In this study, we propose to use the 2D FDTD model to simulate the GPR detection of bridge deck defects. The effectiveness of the 2D model is validated by comparison to a full 3D model. The bridge deck is a relatively uniform in the transverse direction so that the 2D longitudinal geometry analysis can therefore adequately capture most of the 3D scattering behavior.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779605","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779256/04779605.pdf","startPage":"III - 1330","endPage":"III - 1333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of 2D FDTD Ground Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3D FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779605/","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of 2D FDTD Ground Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3D FDTD","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10460563","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4779605/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of 2D FDTD Ground Penetrating Radar Modeling for Bridge Deck Deterioration Evaluated by 3D FDTD","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-3-349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07553S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4779256","articleId":"4779605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4779659,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The relationship is derived directly from a dataset consisting of radar measurements and rain gauge measurements. Tropical Rainfall measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) is known to be the first observation platform for mapping precipitation over the tropics. TRMM measured rainfall is important in order to study the precipitation distribution all over the globe in the tropics. TRMM ground validation is a critical important component in TRMM system. However, the ground sensing systems have quite different characterizations from TRMM in terms of resolution, scale, viewing aspect, and uncertainties in the sensing environments. In this paper a novel hybrid Neural Network model is presented to train ground radars for rainfall estimation using rain gage data and subsequently using the trained ground radar rainfall estimation to train TRMM PR based Neural networks. One year of ground data from Melbourne Florida and Houston Texas are used to demonstrate this hybrid approach. The performance of the rainfall product estimated from TRMM PR is compared against TRMM standard products. A direct gage comparison study is done to demonstrate the improvement brought in by the neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779715/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10472587","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4779715/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Neural Network Technique to Estimate Rainfall from TRMM Measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Neural Network Technique to Estimate Rainfall from TRMM Measurements","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-4-85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060979S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4779630","articleId":"4779715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4779824,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Antonino Licciardi","affiliation":["GEO-K s.r.l., Via del Politecnico 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.

NN have been found to have good generalization properties and their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of remote sensing and in particular for image classification. However, the type of input to be considered for the algorithm in order to maximize the information available from the measurement is still an open issue. Using the mere spectral signature with no pre-processing is not an effective choice. Another point regards the use of textural features to improve the classification which involves taking decisions on how many and what specific features should be considered. More in general, minimizing the number of inputs of a neural network algorithm, avoiding significant loss of information, affects positively the NN mapping ability and computational efficiency. In this paper we propose a new methodology facing with the aforementioned problems and providing a solution to them.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779824","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779630/04779824.pdf","startPage":"IV - 723","endPage":"IV - 726","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tasseled Tap Transformation and Neural Networks for the Design of an Optimum Image Classification Algorithm using Multispectral Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tasseled Tap Transformation and Neural Networks for the Design of an Optimum Image Classification Algorithm using Multispectral Data","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10460581","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4779824/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tasseled Tap Transformation and Neural Networks for the Design of an Optimum Image Classification Algorithm using Multispectral Data","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-4-194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068718S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","xplore-issue":"4779630","articleId":"4779824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4779831,"authors":[{"name":"Cao Kai","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Resource Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Cao","lastName":"Kai","id":"37089115705"},{"name":"Huang Bo","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Resource Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Bo","id":"37937628000"},{"name":"Lu Heng","affiliation":["School of Geography Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Lu Heng","id":"37088291126"},{"name":"Liu Biao","affiliation":["Institute of Space &Earth Information Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Biao","id":"37088302678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779831","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Remote sensing","Training data","Geography","Robustness","Pattern recognition","Image recognition","Radial basis function networks","Resource management","Geoscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network algorithm","Nanjing","China","remote sensing","images classification","Thematic Mapper","Enhanced Thematic Mapper+","TM-ETM+ image","robust classification","Gaussian RBF network","local learning","fast training phase","pattern classification","high classification accuracy","maximum likelihood","MLC model","MLP NN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TM/ETM+","Nanjing","RBF Neural Network","MLC","BPMLP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779831","abstract":"The classification of remote sensing images is more and more important along with the development of society and economy. According to the defects general classification methods have, such as the accuracy, the efficiency etc, the design of `robust' classification system based on a Gaussian RBF neural Network is used in this article to classify the TM/ETM+ image in Nanjing. The choice of this neural network model is justified by some of its particular properties, i. e., local learning, fast training phase, ability to recognize when an input pattern has fallen into a region of the input space without training data, and capability to provide high classification accuracies on remote sensing images. For appraising the precision of the model in brief, over 1000 examples are chosen in this research, and the result shows that in the whole research area there is obvious improvement (86.6-89.7%) between MLC and this model. Besides, it is also better than the MLP NN model (87.9-89.7%). The result indicates that the model of RBF NN is a good approach for the classification of remote sensing in this area based on TM/ETM+. Of course, there are also many aspects need to be revised and improved in the future research such as the accuracy and for other data source.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779831","startPage":"IV - 750","endPage":"IV - 753","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779630","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779630/04779831.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RBF Neural Network Supported Classification of Remote Sensing Images Based on TM/ETM+ in Nanjing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779831/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RBF Neural Network Supported Classification of Remote Sensing Images Based on TM/ETM+ in Nanjing","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4779831/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10472621","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBF Neural Network Supported Classification of Remote Sensing Images Based on TM/ETM+ in Nanjing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-4-201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073746S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4779630","articleId":"4779831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4779875,"authors":[{"name":"Swapnil Chaudhari","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Swapnil","lastName":"Chaudhari","id":"37088253766"},{"name":"Ramprasad Balasubramanian","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ramprasad","lastName":"Balasubramanian","id":"37288869200"},{"name":"Avijit Gangopadhyay","affiliation":["School for Marine Science and Technology, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Avijit","lastName":"Gangopadhyay","id":"38117351300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2807-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2808-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6996"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-7003"}],"articleNumber":"4779875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ocean temperature","Sea surface","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Image segmentation","Sea measurements","Satellite broadcasting","Clustering algorithms","Temperature sensors","Backpropagation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","neural nets","ocean temperature","oceanographic regions","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocean upwelling detection algorithm","Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer","AVHRR","sea surface temperature","SST","ocean color image","neural-network","Monterey Bay region","Central California coast","frontal boundary","AD 2003 07 to 09","remote sensing","oceanographic feature","California Current System","automatic detection","coastal upwelling feature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Upwelling detection","Sea-WiFS","Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779875","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel method for the detection and segmentation of upwelling regions in AVHRR SST data.

The process is started with the training of a feed-forward back-propagation neural network for the purpose of finding regions of \"uniform\" temperatures, resulting in labeled clusters. Then statistical information is gathered from the various clusters. A quantitative criterion is developed that is used to test the existence of prominent upwelling region followed by detection and segmentation.

A desire to increase the number of possible reflectance-based calibrations led the University of Arizona Remote Sensing Group (RSG) to deploy multispectral, downlooking radiometers at the RSG's Railroad Valley test site in Nevada. The radiometers are coupled with data from a sun photometer to provide the information needed for reflectance-based calibration without the need for on-site personnel. Results from these radiometers show similar uncertainties as on-site methods, and early results have led to their use with geostationary sensors, for derivation of surface bi-directional reflectance effects, and for comparisons of biases between sensors. The results show that radiometers with a single view angle are sufficient to characterize BRDF effects for Railroad Valley Playa. The results also give confidence in the automated approach as a means for cross-calibration relative to the vicarious results providing similar intercomparison results as with on-site personnel.","displayPublicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4757194/4779630/04779977.pdf","startPage":"IV - 1332","endPage":"IV - 1335","publicationTitle":"IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4779630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4779977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intercomparison of Imaging Sensors using Automated Ground Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Radiometers","Calibration","Personnel","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Radiometry","Remote sensing","Testing","Sun","Photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","geophysical equipment","geophysical techniques","image sensors","radiometers","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imaging sensor intercomparison","automated ground measurements","reflectance based method","absolute radiometric calibration","reflectance based calibrations","University of Arizona RSG","Remote Sensing Group","multispectral downlooking radiometers","Railroad Valley test site","Nevada","sun photometer","geostationary sensors","surface bidirectional reflectance effects","inter-sensor bias estimation","BRDF effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radiometric calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4779977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Intercomparison of Imaging Sensors using Automated Ground Measurements","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4779977/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10472675","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intercomparison of Imaging Sensors using Automated Ground Measurements","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGARSS-4-347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045761S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4757194","isNumber":"4779630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4757194","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4779630","articleId":"4779977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
