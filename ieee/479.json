Based on these relationships, cumulant-based stochastic realization algorithms are developed. The output noise may be colored Gaussian or i.i.d. non-Gaussian with unknown variance. When a state-space representation is adopted, the stochastic realization problem reduces to the realization of an appropriate Hankel matrix formed by cumulant statistics. Using a Kronecker product formulation, exact expressions are presented for identifying state-space quantities when output cumulants are provided, or for computing output cumulants when the state-space triple is known. Conditions for stationarity of a linear process, with respect to its cumulants, are also presented.

A framework for the analysis and control of multiple manipulator systems with respect to the dynamic behavior of the manipulated object is developed. A multi-effector/object system is treated as an augmented object representing the total masses and inertias perceived at some operational point. This system is actuated by the total effector forces acting at that point. The allocation of forces is based on the minimization of the total joint actuator efforts. For serial structures, the effective inertial characteristics of a combined macro/micro-manipulator are shown to be dominated by the inertial characteristics of the micro-manipulator. A new approach for a dextrous dynamic coordination of such mechanisms based on treating the combined system as a single redundant manipulator while minimizing of the deviation from the neutral (mid-range) joint positions of the micro-manipulator is proposed.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4789671/4789672/04790078.pdf","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2147","publicationTitle":"1988 American Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4789672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1988.4790078","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1988.4790078","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 American Control Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4790078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Robot kinematics","Force control","Control systems","Motion control","Parallel robots","Arm","Orbital robotics","Computer science","Laboratories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4790078/","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Object and Reduced Effective Inertia in Robot Systems","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"June 1988","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1988","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Object and Reduced Effective Inertia in Robot Systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033408S","chronDate":"15-17 June 1988","isNumber":"4789672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4789671","citationCount":"38","articleId":"4790078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4790079,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Kreutz","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Kreutz","id":"38162648900"},{"name":"Anatole Lokshin","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anatole","lastName":"Lokshin","id":"38186206800"}],"articleNumber":"4790079","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Force control","Control systems","Linear feedback control systems","Kernel","Force feedback","Equations","Manipulator dynamics","Kinematics","Jacobian matrices"]}],"abstract":"We give the general dynamical equations for several rigid link manipulators rigidly grasping a commonly held rigid object. It is shown that the number of lost arm configuration degrees of freedom due to imposing the closed loop kinematic constraints is the same as the number of degrees of freedom gained for controlling the internal forces of the closed chain system. This number is equal to the dimension of the kernel of the Jacobian operator which transforms contact forces to the net forces acting on the held object, and it is shown that this kernel can be identified with the subspace of controllable internal forces of the closed chain system. Control of these forces allows one to regulate the grasping forces imparted to the held object or to control the load taken by each arm. It is shown that the internal forces can be influenced without affecting the control of the configuration degrees of freedom, and that this fact is independent of control law choice and involves only kinematical information about each arm. Control laws of feedback linearization type are shown to be useful for controlling the location and attitude of a frame fixed with respect to the held object, while simultaneously controlling the internal forces of the closed chain system. Since the kernel describing the internal forces subspace depends only on the relative location of arm tip contact points, force feedback can be used to feedback linearize and control the system even when the held object has unknown mass properties.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1988.4790079","publicationTitle":"1988 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4789671/4789672/04790079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1988.4790079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4789672","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Balancing and Closed Chain Multiple Arm Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4790079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load Balancing and Closed Chain Multiple Arm Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4790079/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1988","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Balancing and Closed Chain Multiple Arm Control","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032022S","chronDate":"15-17 June 1988","isNumber":"4789672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4789671","citationCount":"26","articleId":"4790079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4790091,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The main tool which we employ is Birth-and-Death Markov chains, describing the Hamming distance of the network's state from the stored patterns.

Using the non-causal, innovations driven model we derive a spectrum estimation algorithm based upon a definition of state for non-causal rational systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Interpolation Theory for Multidimensional Identification and Estimation","publicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1989.4790372","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790148/4790149/04790372.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1989.4790372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4790372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4790372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Linear Interpolation Theory for Multidimensional Identification and Estimation","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"June 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Interpolation Theory for Multidimensional Identification and Estimation","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033426S","chronDate":"21-23 June 1989","isNumber":"4790149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790148","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4790372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4790379,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We first explore the differences in uncertainty representations and control designs between continuous time systems and discrete time systems, particularly the high frequency interpretation does not work for discrete time systems. It is shown that uncertainties appeared in sampled data systems may be highly structured, however they do not fall into any category which is currently available in the literature. Secondly, we define a measure on these uncertainties which confines a neighborhood to the nominal model in terms of frequency content, and then we propose a control design method which guarantees the stability of the closed loop system in the face of uncertainties. Last, we consider a generalization of a classical continuous time approach in representing the multiplicative uncertainty to sampled data systems by using a slightly modified sampler and present a method to calculate a frequency bound on the uncertainty in sampled data systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1989.4790415","publicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790148/4790149/04790415.pdf","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1451","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1989.4790415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainties in Sampled Data Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Uncertainties in Sampled Data Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1989","publicationDate":"June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4790415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainties in Sampled Data Systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029361S","chronDate":"21-23 June 1989","isNumber":"4790149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790148","articleId":"4790415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4790463,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The experimental facility consists of two stirred tank reactors with an acid-base neutralization taking place in each tank. The process has been designed as a demonstration unit for the evaluation of advanced Control strategies such as adaptive and multivariable control. The neutralization process has four controlled variables, pH and liquid level in each of the two tanks. This strong acid, strong base neutralization poses a difficult multivariable problem because each manipulated variable has a significant effect on each controlled output. This process is also highly nonlinear and time varying due to the inherent nonlinearity associated with pH control and the shifts in the titration curve that occur when the amount of buffering agent changes in an unpredictable fashion. A physical model of the neutralization process has been developed which is in good agreement with experimental step response data over a wide range of experimental conditions. A multiloop control system consisting of four PID controllers was tedious to tune and had difficult coping with changes in the amount of buffering. In a companion paper (Hall and Seborg, 1989), self-tuning control resulted in improved control especially when only the process gain was estimated on-line, assuming that the dynamics were not changing significantly.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1989.4790490","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1827","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790148/4790149/04790490.pdf","publicationTitle":"1989 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1989.4790490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and Self-Tuning Control of a Multivariable pH Neutralization Process Part I: Modelling and Multiloop Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process control","Control systems","Process design","Effluents","Hydrogen","Biological control systems","Inductors","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Three-term control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4790490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and Self-Tuning Control of a Multivariable pH Neutralization Process Part I: Modelling and Multiloop Control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and Self-Tuning Control of a Multivariable pH Neutralization Process Part I: Modelling and Multiloop Control","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02678S","chronDate":"21-23 June 1989","isNumber":"4790149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790148","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4790490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4790505,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As a prerequisite to controller design, a nine state nonlinear model including an internal combustion engine, engine transmission dynamics, and tire friction characteristics has been developed. Parametric studies revealed that simple linear models cannot predict the vehicle transients. Due to this highly nonlinear nature of the vehicle, the use of a nonlinear controller was proposed. A nonlinear control strategy using throttle engine control for a platoon of two vehicles was studied using the technique of Sliding Control. In our analysis, the quantities of primary concern are position and velocity tracking errors.

In this paper, the lateral feedback and feedforward controllers are designed to satisfy these objectives by utilizing the frequency-shaped linear quadratic (FSLQ) control theory. This design method allows that the ride quality be included in the performance index explicitly, and the high-frequency robustness characteristic be improved by properly choosing the weighting factors. It is shown that a controller with fixed gains does not perform satisfactorily under all conditions. Therefore, an estimator for comering stiffness of the tires is proposed to enhance performance.

Unlike parameter- and performance- adaptive controllers, this controller is designed only to modify the reference input of a low-level servo controller. Because the internal parameters and structure of the low-level controller are not affected, commercial servo controllers can be made to perform more sophisticated tasks than originally intended. The principle of the knowledge-based controller, modification of the reference input, knowledge representation, existence of the solution, and analyses of the controller's stability and tracking error are described in detail. A self-tuning multiple-step predictor is designed as a part of the controller to eliminate the undesirable effects of system time delay.

These are techniques which are capable of providing estimates of `difficult-to-measure' fermentation process variables from other easily available process measurements. In the literature, two avenues tend to predominate: on being based upon the use of physicochemical models, while the other makes use of an input-output or `black-box' model structure. Clearly, those based upon an accurate physical description will offer the best performance. In reality, however, the best possible situation will be the availability of a `reasonable' process model. Alternatively, at the other end of the spectrum of process knowledge, is the use of `adaptive' generically structured observers. Firstly, a generally structured linear estimator will be introduced. Successful applications of this estimator to an idustrial mycelial fermentation will be presented. Such success is due to the continuous nature of the process, which undergoes smaller changes in dynamics than, say, a batch fermentation. For such cases it is felt that more representative nonliner observers are required. A technique now receiving recognition is that of artificial neural networks. The neural network paradigm is discussed and a comparison with the performance of the adaptive linear estimator is presented.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1990.4791115","startPage":"2173","endPage":"2178","publicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1990.4791115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790679","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790678/4790679/04791115.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Adaptive Estimation with Neural based Techniques for Bioprocess Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791115/","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Adaptive Estimation with Neural based Techniques for Bioprocess Application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Adaptive Estimation with Neural based Techniques for Bioprocess Application","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088275S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1990","isNumber":"4790679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790678","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4791115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4791169,"authors":[{"name":"Evelio Hernandaz","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-O100"],"firstName":"Evelio","lastName":"Hernandaz","id":"37087605655"},{"name":"Yaman Arkun","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaman","lastName":"Arkun","id":"37611052500"}],"articleNumber":"4791169","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4791169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control system synthesis","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Predictive models","Tellurium","Continuous-stirred tank reactor","Control systems","Active appearance model","Positron emission tomography"]}],"doi":"10.23919/ACC.1990.4791169","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790678/4790679/04791169.pdf","publicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","startPage":"2454","endPage":"2459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1990.4791169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Modeling and an Extended DMC Algorithm to Control Nonlinear Systems","abstract":"In this paper we propose a solution to the model predictive control problem for the case when the model is given by a nonlinear neural network.

Backpropagation produces-decision surface that effectively separate training examples of different cases.

The decision surfaces may deviate from optimality and take on non-intuitive shapes because the decision surfaces are based on hyperplanes. This also results in backpropagation networks having no mechanism to detect when a case to be classified falls in a region with no training data. To remedy these difficulties a network is proposed which uses Radial Basis Functions instead of sigmoid threshold units.

The corresponding generalized probabilistic data association is derived and improved tracking performance is demonstrated for targets with several signal to noise ratio values.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Radar tracking","Filters","Position measurement","Time measurement","Signal processing","Noise level","Background noise","Signal to noise ratio","Underwater tracking"]}],"doi":"10.23919/ACC.1990.4791244","publicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790678/4790679/04791244.pdf","startPage":"2875","endPage":"2880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1990.4791244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Tracking with Target Amplitude Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4791244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated Tracking with Target Amplitude Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791244/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Tracking with Target Amplitude Information","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022354S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1990","isNumber":"4790679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790678","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4791244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4791247,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Due to the highly nonlinear nature of automotive engines and the need for robustness of the design, sliding control is a likely choice. However, a standard sliding derivation for an automotive engine results in an unpractical control law. An alternate method of deriving sliding controls can be used that defines one of the states to be a synthetic control. A control law is derived assuming the synthetic control as the input. A second law must then be derived to control the synthetic state. For automotive engines, the two surface controller is be much simpler and more robust than the standard control law. By taking advantage of the fact that the engine only has one output, it is possible to develop a method of coordinating the spark and throttle inputs in such a way as to take advantage of their respective strengths. Experimental implementation of the two surface control law with combined spark/throttle control has verified the performance and robustness of this algorithm.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1990.4791247","publicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790678/4790679/04791247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1990.4791247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790679","startPage":"2891","endPage":"2897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Speed Control for Automotive Engines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4791247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Speed Control for Automotive Engines","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791247/","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Speed Control for Automotive Engines","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030289S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1990","isNumber":"4790679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790678","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4791247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4791267,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

This implies that the solutions obtained may be suboptimal in some cases, but will be easier to obtain and implement than true minimum-time solutions.

The study of system invertibility becomes necessary for design of control systems incorporated with neural networks. A class of nonlinear dynamic systems, such as robotic systems, has been investigated in finding a lower bound of the system relative orders. This study turns out a useful criterion for determining the least number of excitations to a neural network to be designed for learing the system inverse. It has also been investigated by many researchers that through learning, a three-layer neural network can implement a function of certain types within any error accuracy. In this paper, utilizing all previous results in considerations of the least number of excitations, function approximations and the least number of hiden processing elements, the design of neural network architectures and learning approaches are further studied. A supervised learning strategy used to train a neural network to be a functional block for controlling robotic systems are also explored and discussed.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1990.4791270","pdfPath":"/iel5/4790678/4790679/04791270.pdf","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3018","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","publicationTitle":"1990 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1990.4791270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4790679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Nonlinear System Invertibility and Learning Approaches by Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"On Nonlinear System Invertibility and Learning Approaches by Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"May 1990","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Nonlinear System Invertibility and Learning Approaches by Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059571S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1990","isNumber":"4790679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4790678","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4791270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4791272,"authors":[{"name":"Roman W.

Recent developments in fuzzy logic and neural networks provide a new mathematical platform to develop new methodologies for the emulation of human-like interference mechanisms for its application to decision and control problems. In this paper, we provide a mathematical fusion of fuzzy logic and neural network for the development of fuzzy neural networks. Fuzzy neural networks provide a new methodology for handling a stream of qualitative (fuzzy) data with learning and adaptive capabilities, the important attributes of human cognition and perception. We expect that during the next deade, this new methology will lead to some innovative theoretical developments with extensive applications in the problems related to decision and control, expert systems, knowledge-based systems, pattern recognition, and emulation of problems related to human cognition and perception. This new theory will, hopefully, lead to the development of robust intelligent systems.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1991.4791317","startPage":"30","endPage":"31","publicationTitle":"1991 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1991.4791317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791300","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791299/4791300/04791317.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks with Applications to Decision and Control Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791317/","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks with Applications to Decision and Control Problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks with Applications to Decision and Control Problems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028737S","chronDate":"26-28 June 1991","isNumber":"4791300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791299","articleId":"4791317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4791419,"authors":[{"name":"Xianzhong Cui","affiliation":["Real-Time Computing Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xianzhong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37379436200"},{"name":"Kang G.

To overcome these problems, an adaptive controller is designed using neural networks and tested extensively via simulations. One of the key problems in designing such a controller is to develop an efficient training algorithm. Neural networks are usually trained using the output errors of the network, instead of using the output errors of the controlled plant. However, when a neural network is used to control a plant directly, the output errors of the network are unknown, since the desired control actions are unknown. In this paper, we propose a simple training algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems, which enables the neural network to be trained by the output errors of the controlled plant. The only a priori knowledge of the controlled plant is the direction of its output response. A detailed analysis of the algorithm is presented and the corresponding theorems are proved. Due to its simple structure and algorithm, and good performance, the proposed controller has high potential for handling difficult problems in industrial process control systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791419/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Industrial Process Controller using Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Industrial Process Controller using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041375S","chronDate":"26-28 June 1991","isNumber":"4791300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791299","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4791419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4791451,"authors":[{"name":"I.

It is shown that use of B-Spline receptive field functions in conjunction with more general CMAC weight addressing schemes allows higher-order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives.

The CMAC structure can be implemented in hardware that is extremely fast, uses relatively few numbers of weights and trains more quickly than other forms of neural controllers. As yet, however, little has been reported in the literature concerning the stability characteristics of CMAC networks when used in feedback control systems. In this paper, stability of the CMAC network itself is analyzed in terms of a simplified linear model. The open-loop eigenvalues are shown to be functions of the network design parameters such as generalization, network size, and learning rate factor. The network is also analyzed in a simple closed-loop control system. While the results are not completely general, trends are exposed between rapid learning and closed-loop stability. The results are similar to the classic tradeoff between bandwidth and rise-time in all linear systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791646/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"stability Properties of CMAC Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"stability Properties of CMAC Neural Networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024723S","chronDate":"26-28 June 1991","isNumber":"4791300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791299","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4791646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4791649,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Both classes of problems addressed are generic in the control of dynamical systems using neural networks and the solutions proposed have wide applications. The paper considers low order dynamical systems in which the control input enters additively. In view of the nonlinear nature of the plant, precise analytic statements can be made at present only for first order systems. However, the concepts are applicable to higher order systems and simulation results are provided for second order systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed.

A control law based on the inversion of an input-output map is obtained. The outputs are chosen as the sum of the joint angle and tip elastic deformation times a constant factor for each link. The stable maneuver of the arm critically depends on the stability of the zero dynamics of the system. Stability of the zero dynamics is shown to be sensitive to the choice of the constant multiplying factor, which explains the difficulty in controlling the tip position. A critical value of the constant factor for control is obtained and this corresponds to a coordinate in the neighbourhood of the actual tip position. Although the inverse controller accomplishes output control, this excites the rigid and elastic modes. A linear stabilizer is designed for final capture of the terminal state and stabilization of the elastic modes. Simulation results are presented to show that in the closed-loop system, large maneuvers can be performed in the presence of payload uncertainty.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1991.4791713","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791299/4791300/04791713.pdf","startPage":"1879","endPage":"1884","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 American Control Conference","publicationTitle":"1991 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1991.4791713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse Trajectory Control and Zero Dynamics Sensitivity of an Elastic Manipulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4791713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Inverse Trajectory Control and Zero Dynamics Sensitivity of an Elastic Manipulator","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"June 1991","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Trajectory Control and Zero Dynamics Sensitivity of an Elastic Manipulator","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070137S","chronDate":"26-28 June 1991","isNumber":"4791300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791299","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4791713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4791778,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

Under mild assumptions about the degree of smoothness exhibited by the nonlinear functions, the algorithm is proven to be stable, with tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of zero. A constructive procedure is detailed, which directly translates the assumed smoothness properties of the nonlinearities involved into a specification of the network required to represent the plant to a chosen degree of accuracy.

In fermentation processes, direct on-line measurements of primary process variables usually are unavailable. The state of the cultivation, therefore, has to be inferred from measurements of secondary variables and any previous knowledge of process dynamics. This research investigates the learning, recall and generalization characteristics of neural networks trained to model the nonlinear behavior of a fermentation process. Two different neural network methodologies are discussed, namely, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, which differ in their treatment of time dependence. The neural networks are trained by backpropagation using a conjugate gradient technique, which provides a dramatic improvement in the convergence speed. The objective is to use environmental and physiological information available from on-line sensors to estimate concentrations of species in a bioreactor. Results of the neural network estimators are presented, based on experimental data available from the ethanol production by Zymomonas mobilis fermentation. The feed-forward and recurrent neural network methodologies are demonstrated to perform suitably as unmeasurable state estimators. Both networks offer comparable abilities of recall, but recurrent networks perform better than feed-forward networks in generalization.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1992.4792115","startPage":"495","endPage":"499","publicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1992.4792115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791999","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791998/4791999/04792115.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Neural Networks in Bioprocess State Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4792115/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Neural Networks in Bioprocess State Estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Neural Networks in Bioprocess State Estimation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052361S","chronDate":"24-26 June 1992","isNumber":"4791999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791998","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4792115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4792116,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Maintaining optimum performance may entail the precision control of dynamic systems whose model is unknown or highly uncertain, is highly complex (multidimensional and non-linear), and can vary with time. This will require a robust and adaptive control system, the capabilities of which are likely to be beyond those available with conventional techniques. Conventional data processing techniques are ideally suited to applications where the physics of the problem are understood or rules can be specified to describe the behaviour. Artificial neurl networks, in contast, are at their most powerful when applied to problems whose solution requires knowledge which is difficult to specify, but for which there is an abundance of examples. Most complex control problems are of this type in that examples of the system behaviour in response to different control system stimuli are redily availble. British Gas plc and SD-Scicon UK Limited have carried out an investigation of the application of neural networks to the model based control of an experimental furnace. For this, SD-Scicon developed a neural network model of the fumace using open-loop test data provided by British Gas, who incorporated the model into an explicit generalised predictive control scheme and carried out a performance evaluation. This paper describes the background to this work, describes the control system design including the neural network development and training, and presents and discusses the control system performance.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1992.4792116","startPage":"500","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1992.4792116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791999","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791998/4791999/04792116.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network based Furnace Control System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4792116/","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network based Furnace Control System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network based Furnace Control System","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030489S","chronDate":"24-26 June 1992","isNumber":"4791999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791998","articleId":"4792116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4792125,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chee Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chao-Chee","lastName":"Ku","id":"37388390000"},{"name":"Kwang Y.

An unknown plant is identified by a Diagonal Recurrent Neuroidentifier (DRNI), and provides the sensitivity information of the plant to a Diagonal Recurrent Neurocontroller (DRNC). A dynamic backpropagation (DBP), is developed to train both DRNC and DRNI. The DRNN captures the dynamic nature of a system and since it is not fully connected, training is much faster than a fully connected recurrent neural network. The architecture of DRNN is a modified model of the fully connected recurrent neural network with one hidden layer. The hidden layer is comprised of self-recurrent neurons, each feeding its output only into itself. The dynamic backpropagation algorithm (DBP) is developed to train the recurrent neural networks for dynamic mappings, which are found in applications such as control, speech processing and sequential cognition. The proposed DRNN architecture is applied to numerical problems and the simulation results are included.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791998/4791999/04792125.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"549","publicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1992.4792125","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1992.4792125","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4792125","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Control systems","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Backpropagation algorithms","Neural networks","Chaos","Process control","Speech processing","Cognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4792125/","displayDocTitle":"System Identification and Control using Diagonal Recurrent Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"June 1992","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1992","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Identification and Control using Diagonal Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040683S","chronDate":"24-26 June 1992","isNumber":"4791999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791998","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4792125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4792127,"authors":[{"name":"Mitchell M.

The eye-in-hand configuration consists of a CCD camera mounted on the end-effector of the robotic manipulator to provide visual measurements of the motion of the target's features. The vision algorithm is based on a cross-correlation technique, called SSD optical flow. The camera model introduces a number of parameters that must be estimated on-line. An adaptive control algorithm compensates for the Servcing errors and the computational delays which are introduced by the time-consuming vision algorithms.

Most control algorithms for nonlinear processes perform a linearization making use of an inverse of the system. In the linear case, the system can be factored into the minimum-phase and the nonminimum-phase parts and only the first one is inverted for purpose of control design. A similar scheme for nonlinear systems is still under investigation. The present work adresses the problem of synthesizing nonlinear state feedback controllers for nonlinear, nonminimum-phase processes in three different ways. The first approach consists of a partial linearization which preserves stability by using an approximate stable/anti-stable factorization. The second technique can be viewed as an inner-outer factorization based approach. And, finally, in the single-output case, it is shown (through an example) that stabilization of the internal dynamics of a nonmininum-phase system can be achieved by using an additional input if this is feasible in practice. In this case, the manipulated variables have different roles, i.e., one is chosen such as to input/output feedback linearize the system and the second is used to locally stabilize the resulting nonminimum-phase internal dynamics.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1992.4792605","startPage":"2571","endPage":"2575","publicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1992.4792605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4791999","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4791998/4791999/04792605.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Nonlinear Systems with Poorly Behaved Zero Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4792605/","displayDocTitle":"On Nonlinear Systems with Poorly Behaved Zero Dynamics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Nonlinear Systems with Poorly Behaved Zero Dynamics","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071318S","chronDate":"24-26 June 1992","isNumber":"4791999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4791998","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4792605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4792608,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

Using a backpropagation algorithm, we were able to train and optimize network training to predict the coefficients by changing the network characteristics. The network's ability to reduce the error between actual aircraft data and the trained network output depends on the number of network layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the types of transfer functions used to represent the neurons, and the method by which the training data is presented to the neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4793097/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Estimator for a Maneuvering Aircraft","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Estimator for a Maneuvering Aircraft","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092815S","chronDate":"2-4 June 1993","isNumber":"4792782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4792781","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4793097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4793106,"authors":[{"name":"Xianzhong Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xianzhong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37379436200"},{"name":"Kang G.

Typical required positioning accuracies are in the range of 2.5\u03bcm to 0.25\u03bcm (1/10,000 in to 1/100,000 in). The trend is to require even higher accuracies. It is very difficult to assure such accuracies due to many factors affecting the precision of motion, such as friction and backlash in the drive system. The standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type servo control algorithms are not capable of delivering the desired precision under the influence of friction and backlash. A learning control algorithm based on Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is studied for servo motion control under the presence of friction and backlash with the ultra-precision machine tool applications in mind. The CMAC learning controller is conceptually simpler, has faster learning convergence, and more practical than the well known feedforward backpropagation artificial neural network architectures. The CMAC control algorithm is implemented using C-language on an IBM-PC compatible.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Servosystems","Machine tools","Motion control","Friction","Backpropagation algorithms","Manufacturing","Machining","Assembly systems","Three-term control"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4792782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1993.4793222","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1980","publicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4792781/4792782/04793222.pdf","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1993.4793222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMAC Learning Controller for Servo Control of High Precision Machine Tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CMAC Learning Controller for Servo Control of High Precision Machine Tools","publicationDate":"June 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4793222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMAC Learning Controller for Servo Control of High Precision Machine Tools","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027856S","chronDate":"2-4 June 1993","isNumber":"4792782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4792781","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4793222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4793265,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Elia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Dipartimento Automatica Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Elia","id":"37265777900"},{"name":"Munther A.

In high-speed tracking, the combination of a feedforward controller and a robust feedback controller is desirable: the robust feedback controller compensates for mechanical nonlinearities, parameter variation, and disturbances and lets the dynamic behavior of the actual feedback loop system stay close to the nominal one, which makes it possible for the feedforward controller to correctly anticipate and compensate for closed loop dynamics. The idea of disturbance observers is utilized to construct a robust feedback system, and is combined with the idea of zero phase error feedforward controllers. The overall system is demonstrated to possess excellent tracking performance by simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1993.4793339","startPage":"2494","endPage":"2498","publicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1993.4793339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4792782","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4792781/4792782/04793339.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Digital Tracking Controller Design for High-speed Positioning Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4793339/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Digital Tracking Controller Design for High-speed Positioning Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Digital Tracking Controller Design for High-speed Positioning Systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027042S","chronDate":"2-4 June 1993","isNumber":"4792782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4792781","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4793339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4793345,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The approach is based on the continuity property of the nonlinear functions which represent input-output models of continuous dynamic systems. The approach does not depend on any nonlinear function approximation methods and solely depends on the system's input-output data measured in experiments. By evaluating the modification of an index which is defined as Lipschitz number with the successive modification of model orders, the appropriate model orders can be determined simply and reliably. Theoretical background of the present approach is discussed. Several examples from chaotic dynamic systems, nonlinear plant models are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Identifying Orders of Input-Output Models for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems","publicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","doi":"10.23919/ACC.1993.4793346","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4792781/4792782/04793346.pdf","startPage":"2520","endPage":"2523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC.1993.4793346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4792782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4793346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4793346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Identifying Orders of Input-Output Models for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"June 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Identifying Orders of Input-Output Models for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038386S","chronDate":"2-4 June 1993","isNumber":"4792782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4792781","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4793346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4793347,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoying Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Center For Advanced Manufacturing, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Chaoying","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38187923800"},{"name":"Frank W.

The converter easily can be reconfigured to operate from either a single-phase or three-phase (wye or delta) input line. In addition to providing the benefits of unity power factor operation (i.e., good power utilization of source volt-ampere capacity, negligible harmonic currents and low TIF), the converter can operate from a wide range of input voltages because it minimizes voltage stresses to which power switches are exposed. The power stages and control circuits used in a 2 KW implementation of the converter are described and modeled.

Use of hf resonant inverters result in reduced size, weight and cost. The schemes presented are (i) hf resonant inverter (hfri)-cycloconverter, (ii) hfri-rectifier-pulse width modulated voltage source inverter, (iii) hfri-rectifier-line commutated inverter working with a fixed maximum possible inverting firing angle, and (iv) hfri-rectifier-line connected inverter (with line current modulation). These schemes are compared and based on the comparison, scheme (iii) was selected for initial study and the working principle of this scheme is explained. Although both 1-\u00d8 and 3-\u00d8 systems are easy to implement with this scheme, they generate line frequency current harmonics. Also, line pf is less than unity. To overcome these problems, line current is modulated sinusoidally in scheme (iv). In this scheme, hfri is controlled appropriately to obtain a rectified sine wave of 120 Hz in the dc link and the function of line connected inverter is to unfold this waveform (\u03b1 = 180\u00b0) on alternate half cycles to obtain a sinusoidal line current which is in phase with the line voltage. Methods of commutation of line connected inverter are explained. A 3-\u00d8 system is realized using three identical 1-\u00d8 systems.

The goals are twofold. First it is desirable to increase the jamming margin against a partial-band noise jammer by use of coding and diversity with an efficient error-correction algorithm. Second, it is necessary to totally eliminate the threat of a narrowband jammer (regardless of the jammer's power level) in order to have an effective AJ system. Through an analysis of the effects of partial-band jamming on a frequency-hop spread-spectrum system with diversity, it is shown that the use of Reed-Solomon coding with a parallel errors and erasures decoding algorithm accomplishes these goals. The paper also investigates the accuracy of the Chernoff bound as an approximation to the true performance of a frequency-hop spread-spectrum communication system with diversity, side information, and Reed-Solomon coding. The performance results presented in the paper are exact results based on analysis and computer evaluation and approximate results based on the Chernoff bound. It is shown that the Chernoff bound gives a very poor approximation for many cases of interest.","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"7","endPage":"11","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794652","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794639/4794640/04794652.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antijam Capability of Frequency-Hop Spread-Spectrum with Reed-Solomon Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1983","displayDocTitle":"Antijam Capability of Frequency-Hop Spread-Spectrum with Reed-Solomon Coding","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antijam Capability of Frequency-Hop Spread-Spectrum with Reed-Solomon Coding","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-1-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031169S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","isNumber":"4794640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794639","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4794652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4794668,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia L.

To facilitate error-free message reception, some combination of error correction, error detection, and repeat message transmission is required. This paper compares performance, as related to error-free message reception, of the best error-correcting block codes known. Analyses are given for binary transmission systems with unencoded message lengths between 48 and 960 bits, affected by both bit-independent and burst noise. Effects of code rate, code alphabet order, and codeword length are shown for binary symmetric channel (i.e., hard decision) decoding. Benefits of erasure channel decoding for an interference channel are also shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Block codes","Decoding","Error correction","Automatic repeat request","Working environment noise","Background noise","Reed-Solomon codes","Jamming","Interference channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4794668","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794668","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794639/4794640/04794668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794668","startPage":"114","endPage":"118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794640","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Correction Performance of Block Codes in Binary, Burst Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error Correction Performance of Block Codes in Binary, Burst Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1983","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Correction Performance of Block Codes in Binary, Burst Communication Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-1-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079806S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","isNumber":"4794640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794639","articleId":"4794668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4794684,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Verdu","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verdu","id":"37274351500"}],"articleNumber":"4794684","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Error probability","Matched filters","Digital communication","Delay","Signal analysis","Bit error rate","Gaussian channels","Degradation","Phase detection"]}],"abstract":"Consider an ideal white gaussian channel shared by K users that transmit independent data streams by modulating antipodally a set of assigned signal waveforms without maintaining relative synchronism among them.

These filters provide the processing gain necessary for jam-resistant operation and the electronic programmability essential for a secure system. Small size, low cost, and operation in a military environment are additional requirements imposed by tactical systems. This paper describes the design and performance of a matched filter that meets these requirements by using a custom-designed LSI chip to provide the programmability for a surface acoustic wave (SAW) tapped line. This combination of bipolar-LSI and SAW technology results in a matched filter with near theoretical electrical performance, substantially reduced size and cost, and excellent reproducibility. Additionally, since the LSI circuits are designed for carrier frequency operation up to 300 MHZ, PN code rates of 100 Mb/s are possible. The PMF provides the correlated output (compressed pulse) for a 128-bit, PN coded, MSK input waveform having a carrier frequency of 80 MHz and a code rate of 12.8 Mb/s. Electrical performance is demonstrated by oscilloscope photographs of the impulse and matched filter response of the unit. The sidelobe level is within 1 dB of theoretical and the mismatch loss (processing gain implementation loss) is less than 0.5 dB. Additionally, satisfactory performance is demonstrated over the temperature range of -55 to +125\u00b0C.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794726/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low Cost, Miniature, Programmable SAW Matched Filter for Tactical Spread Spectrum Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Cost, Miniature, Programmable SAW Matched Filter for Tactical Spread Spectrum Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-2-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026299S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","isNumber":"4794698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794639","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4794726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4794730,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The present paper deals with digital matched filters (DMF) which apply digital 1-bit correlators and utilize a binary quantization scheme called 4-phase quantization. The application of 1-bit correlators reduces technical expense in comparison with digital filter designs using a finer amplitude quantization. On the other hand binary correlation entails a noticeable degradation of S/N performance in comparison with analog or quasi-analog devices. In our paper the concept of the so-called 4-Phase DMF and an expression for its S/N degradation are briefly presented. This expression will be discussed and general criteria for optimum filter implementation and waveform design with respect to as low a degradation as possible will be derived. It will be shown that for arbitrary constant envelope spread-spectrum waveforms the S/N degradation can be kept below 2.87 dB by proper selection of the binarily quantized reference waveform programmed into the DMF. For some specific spread-spectrum waveforms such as PN-MSK, PN-PSK and PN-QP SK the lower bound 1.96 dB on the degradation of the 4-Phase DMF can be reached. The paper is supplemented by the description of a DMF which is presently under construction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Matched filters","Filtering","Spread spectrum communication","Correlators","Quantization","Degradation","Surface acoustic waves","Convolvers","Gaussian noise"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794730","startPage":"418","endPage":"423","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794639/4794698/04794730.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Matched Filtering of Arbitrary Spread-Spectrum Waveforms using Correlators with Binary Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Matched Filtering of Arbitrary Spread-Spectrum Waveforms using Correlators with Binary Quantization","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Matched Filtering of Arbitrary Spread-Spectrum Waveforms using Correlators with Binary Quantization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-2-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035726S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","isNumber":"4794698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794639","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4794730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4794782,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Rosenmann","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rosenmann","id":"38190855000"},{"name":"John Gevargiz","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Gevargiz","id":"37377051800"},{"name":"Pankaj K.

The technique has been applied to differential PCM (DPCM) and adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) coders. A robbed sample is replaced by its estimate so that the coding process continues in a normal manner. After one period delay, when the next sample is decoded, the robbed sample is re-estimated using delayed interpolation. Only periodic sample robbing has been considered such as every 4th, every 3rd, etc. The technique is particularly useful where graceful degradation is required under heavy loading conditions. The technique is found to be useful when desired bit rate is about 24kb/s or lower. At these bit rates, the quantizing noise is quite large and tends to mask the interpolation noise introduced due to sample robbing. The technique was evaluated by computer simulation using real time speech inputs. Improvements of up to 3 dB in case of DPCM coder and of up to 1.5 dB in case of ADPCM coder have been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794812","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1983 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794639/4794761/04794812.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1983.4794812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4794812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement of Low Bit-Rate DPCM & ADPCM Coders by Sample Robbing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794812/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of Low Bit-Rate DPCM & ADPCM Coders by Sample Robbing","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of Low Bit-Rate DPCM & ADPCM Coders by Sample Robbing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-3-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028245S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 1983-Nov. 2 1983","isNumber":"4794761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794639","articleId":"4794812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4794813,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A key element to achieving the required bit rate reduction while maintaining acceptable picture quality is the utilization of motion compensation techniques. In this paper issues related to displacement estimation and motion compensation techniques in the low bit rate coding environment are discussed.

In this case, the jammer should transmit a CW signal at a frequency where the power spectrum of the desired signal reaches a peak. For band-limited signals, it is also shown that the best signal design to counter the jammer strategy is to spread the energy spectrum uniformly across the band.

In fact, the effects of filtering followed by amplifying in transmission give rise to power spectrum spreading on account of nonlinear distortion, and consequently to an increase of adjacent channel interference. When the HPA must work at saturation in order to give out its maximum power, angle modulation systems, with constant envelope, seem to be more attractive than amplitude - and phase - modulated ones, which require linearization [1]. In this paper, the CPFSK signal with modulation pulses assumed to be rectangular, with a length \u03c4 less than the symbol time, T, is tested in the above-mentioned conditions. The power spectral density in the various points of the transmitter is displayed for fixed HPA characteristics (AM/AM and AM/PM conversions); its behaviour is analyzed for varying filter bandwidths and modulation parameters (duty-cycle of the modulation pulses, \u03c4/T, and maximum angular frequency deviation, \u03c9\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n). The results obtained, experimentally checked, show that, unlike other angle modulation systems (PSK, offset PSK, MSK), in the CPFSK case the HPA output has a power spectrum which can be efficiently controlled by means of filtering at the intermediate frequency.

In addition, performance in the presence of multiple adjacent channel interferers in a hard-limited satellite channel is analyzed and performance comparisons to conventional modulations are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SBPSK: A Robust Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation for Hard-Limited Channels","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1984 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1984.4794893","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1984 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794814/4794864/04794893.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1984.4794893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4794893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 1984","displayDocTitle":"SBPSK: A Robust Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation for Hard-Limited Channels","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SBPSK: A Robust Bandwidth-Efficient Modulation for Hard-Limited Channels","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-3-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053288S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 1984","isNumber":"4794864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794814","citationCount":"31","articleId":"4794893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4794896,"authors":[{"name":"John Gevargiz","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, & Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Gevargiz","id":"37377051800"},{"name":"Michael Rosenmann","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, & Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rosenmann","id":"38190855000"},{"name":"Pankaj Das","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, & Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Pankaj","lastName":"Das","id":"37285357200"},{"name":"Laurence B.

To compare the significance of the two interferers, the integration of the characteristic function method is used to compute the average bit error probability.

The receiver is matched to a segment of the FH code sequence, sums hard per-channel decisions to form a test, and uses multiple tests to verify acquisition. The length of the matched filter and the number of verification tests are fixed. Optimization is then choosing thresholds to maximize performance based upon the receiver's degree of knowledge about the jammer (\"side-information\"). Four levels of side-information are considered, ranging from none to complete. The latter level results in a constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) design. At each level, performance sensitivity to threshold choice is analyzed. Robust thresholds are chosen to maximize performance as the jammer varies its power distribution, resulting in simple design rules which aid threshold selection.

The proposed scheme uses least-squares adaptive techniques for dealing with fading and multipath radio HF channels. The DDE is based on direct estimation of channel parameters and data blocks. Training data is imbedded into the transmission in the form of blocks of training bits alternated with blocks of source data at a fixed (though selectable) fraction of the transmission. Two DDE techniques, i.e., linear and nonlinear, are discussed in this paper. In the linear DDE, the source data block is estimated by a Levinson recursive algorithm. In the nonlinear DDE, only the end symbols of the data block are kept, quantized, and subtracted from the simultaneous equations. The symbols left in the block are estimated by a Levinson algorithm again, and so forth. The procedure described here is used recursively until all the known symbols are obtained. In both linear and nonlinear DDE techniques, the channel is estimated by a steepest-descent algorithm. As with a linear equalizer, the linear DDE lacks the ability to cope with the fading dispersive HF radio channels. However, the nonlinear DDE works well under the same channel conditions. The analysis shows that the nonlinear DDE can achieve performance similar to the decision-feedback equalization (DFE) technique with known channel conditions. The channel estimator used in the DDE techniques will converge faster than the DFE (see Section VII) if a similar adaptive algorithm is utilized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Directed Estimation Techniques for Single-Tone HF Modems","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1985 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1985.4794975","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1985 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4794914/4794915/04794975.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1985.4794975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4794915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4794975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4794975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 1985","displayDocTitle":"Data Directed Estimation Techniques for Single-Tone HF Modems","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Directed Estimation Techniques for Single-Tone HF Modems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-1-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024706S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 1985","isNumber":"4794915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4794914","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4794975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4795005,"authors":[{"name":"William K.

However, for the full exploitation of the theoretical processing gain achievable when these two methods are combined, frequency compensation is required. This paper examines an anticipative adaptive filter that adapts the complex weights at each antenna element to the appropriate values for a carrier frequency before that frequency is transmitted. The underlying adaptive alogrithm is the Maximin algorithm which has major advantages compared with other algorithms. Computer simulation results are used to compare different versions of anticipative processing. These results show that an appropriate version can ensure the rapid convergence of weights to values that provide wideband nulling of the interference and noise.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1987.4795195","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 1987 - IEEE Military Communications Conference - Crisis Communications: The Promise and Reality","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 1987 - IEEE Military Communications Conference - Crisis Communications: The Promise and Reality","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795133/4795134/04795195.pdf","startPage":"0276","endPage":"0282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1987.4795195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anticipative Adaptive Array for Frequency-Hopping Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795195/","displayDocTitle":"An Anticipative Adaptive Array for Frequency-Hopping Communications","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anticipative Adaptive Array for Frequency-Hopping Communications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-1-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035131S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","isNumber":"4795134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795133","articleId":"4795195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4795200,"authors":[{"name":"B.O.

However, if no a priori timing information is available to the receiver, uniform search over the long pseudonoise code periods generally employed in anti-jam and anti-intercept communications may lead to acquisition times that are prohibitive. The initial uncertainty can be reduced with the aid of shorter code segments, which are processed in matched filters. In order to maintain low probability of exploitation by unintended parties, these code segments should be easily variable. Thus programmable matched filtering is required, which advantageously can be performed by surface acoustic wave (SAW) convolvers. This paper analyses the performance of a combined matched-filter/serial search rapid acquisition strategy, which is based on the application of SAW convolvers to preamble processing. Correct detection of the preamble reduces the uncertainty region for the subsequent serial-search to a few chips. The measure of performance for the combined search strategy is the overall mean acquisition time, which is calculated for an example system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795200/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Combined Matched-Filter/Serial-Search Acquisition Concept for Direct-Sequence Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Matched-Filter/Serial-Search Acquisition Concept for Direct-Sequence Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-1-66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044504S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 1987","isNumber":"4795134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795133","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4795200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4795218,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The experiment proves that digital wide-range electronic speed governor implemented on control chip FPGA can be used widely and fuzzy adaptive tuning PID control algorithm can improve the dynamic response of the system, which makes the electronic speed governor under good control in a wider work scope.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795538.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital wide range electronic speed governor on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Control systems","Three-term control","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy logic","Actuators","Hardware","Automatic control","Robotics and automation","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","hardware description languages","inference mechanisms","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital wide range electronic speed governor","FPGA","digital fuzzy adaptive tuning","PID electronic governor","VHDL description","fuzzy-control","speed detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic speed governor","Speed calculation","Fuzzy adaptive tuning PID","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital wide range electronic speed governor on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479350","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital wide range electronic speed governor on FPGA","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp057-P0388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044897S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4795551,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Saska","affiliation":["Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Saska","id":"37298817800"},{"name":"Martin Hess","affiliation":["Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hess","id":"38082340600"},{"name":"Klaus Schilling","affiliation":["Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg, Wurzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Schilling","id":"37331277000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795551","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"This paper presents a route scheduling algorithm for efficient snow shoveling of big international airports. The keynote of the project consists in using temporary formations of autonomous snowploughs. The size of the formations depends on the width of runway to shovel, which supposes splitting and merging of the teams during the cleaning process.The route scheduling method itself is based on the design of cleaning coalitions which are adapted for each specific task. The decisions about the optimal team composition and the optimal sequence of the tasks are taken by an heuristic approach that is combined with an exploration of the space of solutions on a limited horizon. Furthermore in the paper a formation driving approach is discussed. The method commands the robots to form a formation which optimally covers the roads surface and enables to push the snow by their shovels to the sides effectively. The scheduling method as well as the formation driving approach were verified by simulations and by hardware experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795551.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"397","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Route scheduling approach for airport snow shoveling using formations of autonomous ploughs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airports","Snow","Cleaning","Robot kinematics","Space exploration","Roads","Robotics and automation","Humans","Vehicles","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airports","cleaning","mobile robots","optimisation","scheduling","snow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["route scheduling approach","airport snow shoveling","autonomous plough formations","international airports","cleaning process","optimal team composition","heuristic approach","formation driving approach","mobile robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile robotics","Route Scheduling","Formations driving","Path planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Route scheduling approach for airport snow shoveling using formations of autonomous ploughs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795551/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479363","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Route scheduling approach for airport snow shoveling using formations of autonomous ploughs","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp070-P0614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046127S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4795585,"authors":[{"name":"Tuong Quan Vo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tuong Quan","lastName":"Vo","id":"37585700500"},{"name":"Byung Ryong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Ryong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293393600"},{"name":"Hyoung Seok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292781200"},{"name":"Hyo Seung Cho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyo Seung","lastName":"Cho","id":"38188250600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795585","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine animals","Genetic algorithms","Mobile robots","Humanoid robots","Robot vision systems","Robotics and automation","Mathematical model","Propulsion","Tail","Remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mobile robots","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum velocity","fish robot","hill climbing algorithm","genetic algorithm","underwater robot","remotely operated vehicle","autonomous underwater vehicle","unmanned underwater vehicle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fish robot","optimized","HCA","GA","maximum velocity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795585","abstract":"Recently, the robotics research has been developed very fast in some kinds of robot such as: mobile robot, vision robot, humanoid robot and especially underwater robot.

In this field, the research about one kind of autonomous robot called fish robot still remain at low level of technology and there are many thing need to be done in this type of robot. In this paper, we present a model of 4-link (3 joints) fish robot. This fish robot's maximum velocity is then optimized by using the combination of Hill Climbing Algorithm (HCA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). We use HCA to generate the good initial population for GA and then use GA to find the optimal parameters that give maximum propulsion power in order to make fish robot swim at the fastest velocity. Finally, some simulation results are presented to prove this application.","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795585","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795585.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing maximum velocity of fish robot using Hill Climbing Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing maximum velocity of fish robot using Hill Climbing Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795585/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479397","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing maximum velocity of fish robot using Hill Climbing Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp104-P0255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042819S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4795589,"authors":[{"name":"Shelten G.

However, the rapid movements of internal heart structures pose a serious challenge to the surgeon that is compounded by the presence of significant time delays in 3D ultrasound imaging. This paper investigates the concept of using a one-degree-of-freedom motion compensation system to synchronize instruments with tissue motions that are approximately one-dimensional. We first describe the motion of the mitral valve, which is well approximated by a 1D model. The subsequent development of a motion compensation system is described, which comprises a motion compensation instrument as well as an extended Kalman filter that can compensate for system delays. The benefits and robustness of the resulting system are demonstrated in user trials under tracking conditions with measurement noise, delay, and heart rate variability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795589.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"622","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic motion compensation for beating intracardiac surgery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot motion","Surgery","Ultrasonic imaging","Motion compensation","Heart","Instruments","Surges","Delay effects","Valves","Delay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","cardiology","delays","Kalman filters","medical robotics","motion compensation","robust control","surgery","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic motion compensation","intracardiac surgery","3D ultrasound imaging","minimally-invasive surgery","internal heart structures","time delays","mitral valve","extended Kalman filter","robustness","heart rate variability","measurement noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasound","visual servoing","cardiac surgery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robotic motion compensation for beating intracardiac surgery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795589/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479401","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic motion compensation for beating intracardiac surgery","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp108-P0887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060517S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4795593,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Bogdan Rusu","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Radu Bogdan","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37393726300"},{"name":"Zoltan Csaba Marton","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Zoltan Csaba","lastName":"Marton","id":"37583288500"},{"name":"Nico Blodow","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Blodow","id":"37571998400"},{"name":"Michael Beetz","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Beetz","id":"37279125900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795593","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Histograms","Layout","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Robotics and automation","Intelligent robots","Labeling","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object model map acquisition","robust feature point representations","3D point cloud","multivalue histogram","sampling density invariance","geometric primitives","machine learning algorithm","dataset generation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a set of methods for building informative and robust feature point representations, used for accurately labeling points in a 3D point cloud, based on the type of surface the point is lying on.

Often the statistical model is composed of two types of parameters : the informative parameters and the nuisance ones. The nuisance parameters are of no interest for detection but they are necessary to complete the model. In the case of unknown, non-random nuisance parameters, their elimination is unavoidable. Some approaches addressing the cases where the nuisance parameters, belonging to a subspace, interfere with the informative ones in a linear manner, use the theory of invariance to reject the nuisance. Sometimes this leads to a certain degradation of the detector performances because some faults become undetectable, masked by the nuisance. Nevertheless, in many cases the physical nature of nuisance parameters is (partially) known, and this knowledge may allow us to define inequality bounds to limit the variations of these parameters. The goal of this paper is to study the statistical performances of the constrained generalized likelihood ratio test used to detect an additive anomaly in the case of bounded nuisance parameters. An example of the integrity monitoring of GNSS train navigation illustrates the relevance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795659","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection with bounded nuisance parameters and safe train navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection with bounded nuisance parameters and safe train navigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795659/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479470","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4795659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection with bounded nuisance parameters and safe train navigation","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp178-P0542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048409S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4795674,"authors":[{"name":"Hwee Choo Liaw","affiliation":["Robotics and Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Hwee Choo","lastName":"Liaw","id":"37296737300"},{"name":"Bijan Shirinzadeh","affiliation":["Robotics and Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Bijan","lastName":"Shirinzadeh","id":"37277968900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795674","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795674","abstract":"This paper investigates the feasibility of a neural network motion control methodology applied in the piezoelectric actuation systems for micro/nano manipulation.

To improve the memory efficiency of RBPF-SLAM, our previous work proposed a SLAM framework based on Rao-Blackwellised particle filters (RBPF) and genetic algorithms (GA) for recovering the full SLAM posterior using raw exteroceptive sensor measurements, i.e. without landmarks. The resultant Rao-Blackwellised genetic algorithmic filter SLAM (RBGAF-SLAM) permits the efficient use of any arbitrary measurement model. However, the drawback is that the GA operators have to be determined heuristically and the parameters have to be tuned through try-and-error. These tuning operations are time consuming and the optimized solution is not guaranteed. In this paper, we provide the detailed description of how to optimize the RBGAF-SLAM operators through genetic learning approach. GA operators and parameters are encoded into chromosomes, while the Euclidian localization error is chosen to build the fitness function. This approach guarantees the consistent SLAM results and ensures the global convergence to the optimal solution of RBGAF-SLAM. Simulations and experimental data are used as training data. A robot with laser range scanner is used to demonstrate the effectiveness in actual implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795692","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795692.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1205","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Rao-Blackwellised genetic algorithmic filter SLAM through genetic learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improving Rao-Blackwellised genetic algorithmic filter SLAM through genetic learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10479503","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4795692/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Rao-Blackwellised genetic algorithmic filter SLAM through genetic learning","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp211-P0449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040268S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4795705,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Benmansour","affiliation":["Aubert, INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Benmansour","id":"37660080600"},{"name":"Raphael Labayrade","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Sciences de lHabitat, Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l''Etat, Vaulx-en-Velin, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Labayrade","id":"37296053900"},{"name":"Didier Aubert","affiliation":["Aubert, INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Aubert","id":"37296055000"},{"name":"Sebastien Glaser","affiliation":["Aubert, INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Glaser","id":"37324054800"},{"name":"Dominique Gruyer","affiliation":["Aubert, INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Gruyer","id":"38490876200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795705","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"abstract":"This paper presents a new method for the detection and 3D reconstruction of the road lane using onboard stereovision. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to overcome the assumptions commonly used in most of the detection systems using monocular vision such as: flat road, constant pitch angle or absence of roll angle. The proposed method of detection and 3D reconstruction is based on two modules. The first one is aimed at detecting the road markings of the lane in each image of the stereoscopic pair. It is based on a recognition algorithm driven by a statistical model of the road lane: the initial state of the model is obtained after a learning stage; it is updated using the results of a feature extraction stage. Our model takes into account the intrinsic links between the projections of the road in the two images of the stereoscopic pair, so that its update from a feature extracted in one of two images drives the detection of the features in the other image. No disparity map is required since the matching of the road features is directly obtained as the result of the model update. The second module is aimed at 3D reconstruction and relative localization of the vehicle with respect to its lane. The parameters of a 3D surface including the horizontal and vertical profiles of the road lane are estimated from the road borders previously detected. The robustness of the algorithm is evaluated from synthetic and real images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Road vehicles","Vehicle detection","Robotics and automation","Machine vision","Feature extraction","Computer vision","Geometry","Vehicle driving","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image recognition","image reconstruction","object detection","roads","stereo image processing","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D lane detection system","3D reconstruction","road lane","onboard stereovision","monocular vision","flat road","constant pitch angle","roll angle","road markings","recognition algorithm","statistical model","feature extraction stage","stereoscopic pair","disparity map","synthetic images","real images"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795705","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795705.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model driven 3D lane detection system using stereovision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A model driven 3D lane detection system using stereovision","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795705/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795705/","accessionNumber":"10479516","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model driven 3D lane detection system using stereovision","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp224-P0520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118441S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4795707,"authors":[{"name":"Honglin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Honglin Huang","id":"37652667400"},{"name":"Anamitra Makur","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anamitra","lastName":"Makur","id":"37266951200"},{"name":"Divya Venkatraman","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Divya","lastName":"Venkatraman","id":"37645897300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795707","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Image reconstruction","Data acquisition","Reconstruction algorithms","Signal processing","Transform coding","Robotics and automation","Sparse matrices","Image sampling","Image storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image reconstruction","image representation","matrix algebra","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video object error coding method","compressive sensing","sparse representations","object-based motion compensation","random signal projection measurements","sparse reconstruction methods","random matrix projection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","object-based video compression","sparse reconstruction","video object error coding"]}],"abstract":"The recently emerged theory of compressive sensing (CS) has a remarkable result that signals having sparse representations in some known basis can be represented (with high probability) by taking a few random projection measurements of the signals. In this paper, we study some CS sparse reconstruction methods and propose a video object error coding method based on CS theory. The proposed system first assumes the moving objects have been segmented from background image and object-based motion compensated from the previous reconstruction frame, and then the resulting object error is encoded by using CS random matrix projection. Finally the coded measurements can be quantized to store or transmit. Experimental results demonstrate the object error blocks can be effectively recovered by using CS sparse reconstruction algorithms. This proposed method would be widely used in the object-based video compression fields.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video object error coding method based on compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795707","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786611/4795481/04795707.pdf","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Video object error coding method based on compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795707/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479518","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video object error coding method based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"rp226-P0594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060311S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786611","isNumber":"4795481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786611","xplore-issue":"4795481","articleId":"4795707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4795753,"authors":[{"name":"Sam Chau Duong","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Sam Chau","lastName":"Duong","id":"37593303600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kinjo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kinjo","id":"37295575200"},{"name":"Eiho Uezato","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiho","lastName":"Uezato","id":"37295573200"},{"name":"Tetsuhiko Yamamoto","affiliation":["Tokushima College of Technology, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuhiko","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37292785900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2286-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2287-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795753","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795753","abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent control method for the Acrobot with applications of neural network (NN) and genetic algorithm (GA).

In this paper, our multi-robot platform and current control techniques we use are discussed. Our robots have 4 wheel omnidirectional drive system, running with brushless DC motors. A camera which is 2 meters above the field provides vision feedback to identify and control the robots. Robot identification is carried out by recognizing colored patches on top of the robots.

Experiments and results on a video trace data demonstrate that the proposed classification scheme based on CNN (BK) outperforms conventional algorithms including self-organizing map (SOM) and conventional CNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICECT.2009.53","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","startPage":"178","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECT.2009.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795900","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795899/4795900/04795945.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Kernel","Video compression","Video on demand","Clustering algorithms","Cellular neural networks","Multimedia databases","Computer networks","Videoconference","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image classification","neural nets","self-organising feature maps","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video data classification","centroid neural network","Bhattacharyya kernel","data mapping","video data compression","Gaussian probability density function","self-organizing map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Centroid","neural network","kernel","GPDF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Video Data Using Centroid Neural Network with Bhattacharyya Kernel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4795945/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4795945/","accessionNumber":"10479667","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Video Data Using Centroid Neural Network with Bhattacharyya Kernel","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"3559a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035825S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795899","isNumber":"4795900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795899","xplore-issue":"4795900","articleId":"4795945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4795954,"authors":[{"name":"Shijue Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shijue","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37291947000"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37634348300"},{"name":"Tingting He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"He","id":"37279452400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3559-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4795954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":549},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Embedded system","Hardware","Software design","Costs","Design optimization","Software performance","Software systems","Performance evaluation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","embedded systems","genetic algorithms","hardware-software codesign"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","embedded system hardware-software partitioning","embedded system hardware-software codesign","embedded system design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware-software partitioning","embedded system","Genetic Algorithm","cost","performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4795954","abstract":"In this paper, we use Genetic Algorithm to do the embedded system hardware-software co-design.

A four-stage pipeline has been adopted to boost the speed of deblocking filter process up to 192 clock cycles per one macroblock. Hybrid edge filter order enhances the reusability of intermediate data which not only increases system throughput, but also reduces power consumption because of diminishing memory access times. In addition, for saving power purpose, our architecture utilizes the buffers instead of SRAM on-chip for storing temporary data. Experimental results show that our design can achieve the throughput of 1146 kMB/s while saving up to 25% power consumption when compared with previous design. The architecture is implemented in 0.18 mum standard cell library, consumes 26.01 K gates at a clock frequency of 220 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/ICECT.2009.109","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795899/4795900/04796039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECT.2009.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795900","startPage":"627","endPage":"631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power High-throughput Deblocking Filter Architecture for H.264/AVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-power High-throughput Deblocking Filter Architecture for H.264/AVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10500748","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power High-throughput Deblocking Filter Architecture for H.264/AVC","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"3559a627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046154S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795899","isNumber":"4795900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795899","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4795900","articleId":"4796039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4796044,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Lei","affiliation":["North China Inst. of Water Conservancy & Hydroelectric Power, Zhengzhou"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Lei","id":"37087911465"},{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["North China Inst. of Water Conservancy & Hydroelectric Power, Zhengzhou"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087914871"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3559-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796044","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Water resources","Neural networks","Water conservation","Cities and towns","Sustainable development","Artificial neural networks","Resource management","Computer networks","Testing","Food industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function networks","statistical analysis","sustainable development","unsupervised learning","water resources","water supply"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comprehensive assessment","sustainable utilization","regional water resource","social economy","eco-environment","index system","regional sustainable development","RBF neural network","radial basis function architecture","dynamically penalized rival competitive learning algorithm","Zhengzhou city","sensitive analysis","water consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Regional water resources","Sustainable development level","Evaluation index","RBF architecture","Neuron network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796044","abstract":"Comprehensive assessment of sustainable utilization of regional water resources, including three subsystems: social economy, water resources and eco-environment, is a large complicated and systematic evaluating problem. The selection of the index system for the regional sustainable development of water resources was discussed herein. Furthermore, a neural network methodology for regional water resources evaluation was introduced. The method adopts the radial basis function (RBF) architecture and dynamically penalized rival competitive learning algorithm, which is fast and repetitive, compared with most traditional techniques. Additionally, a new approach to produce training samples, testing samples and examining samples randomly distributed between the critical values was established. The sample used consists of 16 indexes, and by using the proposed methodology the sustainable evaluation of regional water resources could be successfully done. Results showed that from 1994 to 2005, the comprehensive index of water resources sustainable utilization in Zhengzhou city ascended with a fast speed of 0.023 per year, from sustainable development level IV to level III. The calculation with the model showed that, the comprehensive index of water resources sustainable utilization in the future planning years (2010, 2015, and 2020) could be enhanced with a speed of 0.011 per year. A sensitive analysis indicates that it is necessary to increase eco-environmental water consumption rate, industrial output from each cubic meter of water consumption, public greenbelt area per capita, foodstuff output from each cubic meter of water consumption, and to ensure that natural growth rate of population decreases steadily, which are playing an important role in improving sustainable utilization of water resources in Zhengzhou city.","doi":"10.1109/ICECT.2009.145","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795899/4795900/04796044.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"653","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECT.2009.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4795900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive Assessment of Sustainable Utilization of Water Resources Based on RBF Neural Network Evaluation Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Assessment of Sustainable Utilization of Water Resources Based on RBF Neural Network Evaluation Method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10500752","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796044/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Assessment of Sustainable Utilization of Water Resources Based on RBF Neural Network Evaluation Method","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"3559a649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044706S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795899","isNumber":"4795900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4795900","articleId":"4796044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4796165,"authors":[{"name":"Larry Seiler","affiliation":["PhD in computer science, MIT, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Larry Seiler is a senior principal engineer with Intel's Visual Computing Group, working on graphics APIs and algorithms for Larrabee.

Traditionally, clustering algorithms aim at generating a number of disjoint clusters that satisfy some criteria. In this paper, we formulate a novel clustering problem that aims at generating overlapping multihop clusters. Overlapping clusters are useful in many sensor network applications, including intercluster routing, node localization, and time synchronization protocols. We also propose a randomized, distributed multihop clustering algorithm (KOCA) for solving the overlapping clustering problem. KOCA aims at generating connected overlapping clusters that cover the entire sensor network with a specific average overlapping degree. Through analysis and simulation experiments, we show how to select the different values of the parameters to achieve the clustering process objectives. Moreover, the results show that KOCA produces approximately equal-sized clusters, which allow distributing the load evenly over different clusters. In addition, KOCA is scalable; the clustering formation terminates in a constant time regardless of the network size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","volume":"20","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10951059","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796192/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Overlapping Multihop Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlapping Multihop Clustering for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009121844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135081S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5297618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5297618","articleId":"4796192","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4796196,"authors":[{"name":"Deke Guo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of C4ISR Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5340444/4796196/4796196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deke Guo received the BE degree in industry engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautic and Astronautic, China, in 2001, and the PhD degree in management science and engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2008.

Traditionally, the Bloom filter and its variants just focus on how to represent a static set and decrease the false positive probability to a sufficiently low level. By investigating mainstream applications based on the Bloom filter, we reveal that dynamic data sets are more common and important than static sets. However, existing variants of the Bloom filter cannot support dynamic data sets well. To address this issue, we propose dynamic Bloom filters to represent dynamic sets, as well as static sets and design necessary item insertion, membership query, item deletion, and filter union algorithms. The dynamic Bloom filter can control the false positive probability at a low level by expanding its capacity as the set cardinality increases. Through comprehensive mathematical analysis, we show that the dynamic Bloom filter uses less expected memory than the Bloom filter when representing dynamic sets with an upper bound on set cardinality, and also that the dynamic Bloom filter is more stable than the Bloom filter due to infrequent reconstruction when addressing dynamic sets without an upper bound on set cardinality. Moreover, the analysis results hold in stand-alone applications, as well as distributed applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796196/","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4796196/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10995218","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Dynamic Bloom Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dynamic Bloom Filters","sourcePdf":"ttk2010010120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108976S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5340444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5340444","articleId":"4796196","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796210,"authors":[{"name":"Helia Naeimi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4802402/4796210/4796210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Helia Naeimi (S'00\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2008, 2005, and 2002 respectively.","Since 2008, she has been a Research Scientist with Intel Research, Santa Clara Laboratory, Santa Clara, CA.

We introduce a new approach to design fault-secure encoder and decoder circuitry for memory designs. The key novel contribution of this paper is identifying and defining a new class of error-correcting codes whose redundancy makes the design of fault-secure detectors (FSD) particularly simple. We further quantify the importance of protecting encoder and decoder circuitry against transient errors, illustrating a scenario where the system failure rate (FIT) is dominated by the failure rate of the encoder and decoder. We prove that Euclidean geometry low-density parity-check (EG-LDPC) codes have the fault-secure detector capability.

However, excessive defects from bottom-up stochastic assembly have emerged as a fundamental obstacle for achieving reliable computation using molecular electronics. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic approach to investigate the intrinsic relationship between defect tolerance and inherence redundancy in molecular crossbar systems. By modeling defect-prone molecular crossbars as a non-ideal information processing medium, we determine the information transfer capacity, which can be interpreted as the bound on reliability that a molecular crossbar system can achieve. The proposed method allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of redundancy-based defect tolerance in a quantitative manner. Employing this method, we derive the gap of reliability between redundancy-based defect tolerance and ideal defect-free molecular systems. We also show the implications to the related design optimization problem.","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4802402/04796212.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very

Although a limited amount of parallel access is possible using conventional two-dimensional (2-D) chip memory-processor approaches, 3-D memory-processor stacking greatly extends this to much larger capacity memories. We evaluate high-clock-rate processors as well as shared memory processors with a large number of cores. Various architectural design options to reduce the impact of the memory wall on the processor performance are explored and validated through simulations. Certain architectural features can be implemented in a 3-D chip, such as an ultrawide, ultrashort vertical bus with low parasitic resistance and the elimination of conventional electrostatic discharge, and packaging parasitics required in multiple package 2-D solutions. The objective is to reduce the clocks per instruction figure of merit for high clock speeds in order to deliver significant performance levels. High-clock-rate processors can be designed with SiGe heterostructure bipolar transistors to obtain processors operating on the order of 16 or 32 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007472","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4796865/04796238.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating Memory Wall Effects in High-Clock-Rate and Multicore CMOS 3-D Processor Memory Stacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating Memory Wall Effects in High-Clock-Rate and Multicore CMOS 3-D Processor Memory Stacks","volume":"97","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501030","htmlLink":"/document/4796238/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating Memory Wall Effects in High-Clock-Rate and Multicore CMOS 3-D Processor Memory Stacks","sourcePdf":"jproc-jacob-2007472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096489S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4796865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4796865","articleId":"4796238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796239,"authors":[{"name":"Rino Micheloni","affiliation":["Qimonda Italy Srl, Vimercate, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4796865/4796239/4796239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rino Micheloni (Senior Member, IEEE) was born in San Marino, Italy, in 1969.

Features such as high density, low cost, and fast write times make NAND perfectly suited for media applications where large files of sequential data need to be loaded into the memory quickly and repeatedly. When compared to a hard disk drive, a limitation of the Flash memory is the finite number of erase/write cycles: most of commercially available NAND products are guaranteed to withstand 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n programming cycles at most. As a consequence, special care (remapping, bad block management algorithms, etc.) has to be taken when hard-drive based, read/write intensive applications, such as operating systems, are migrated to Flash-memory based devices. One of the basic requirements of the consumer market for data storage is the portability of stored data from one device to the other. Flash cards are the actual solution. A Flash card is a nonvolatile ldquosystem in packagerdquo in which a NAND Flash memory is embedded with a dedicated controller.

Multistatic MIST beamforming involves illuminating the breast with an ultrawideband (UWB) signal from one antenna while collecting the reflections at an array of antennas, as opposed to traditional monostatic MIST beamforming where only the transmitting antenna records the reflections from the breast. In order to process the multistatic data, traditional data-adaptive artifact removal algorithms have to be modified to accommodate signals from all antennas. Also, the MIST beamforming algorithm, which spatially focuses the signal and compensates for frequency-dependent propagation effects, has to be modified. The algorithms are tested on a 2-D anatomically accurate finite-difference time-domain model of the breast. The multi-MIST beamformer described here is shown to offer an improved signal to clutter ratio when compared to the traditional monostatic MIST beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","volume":"57","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11206213","pubMedId":"19258193","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796242/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Multistatic MIST Beamforming for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Multistatic MIST Beamforming for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer","sourcePdf":"tbme-ohalloran-2016392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098254S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"4796242","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4796251,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The anticipated advantages of the proposed method of packaging are ease of assembly and low part count, making it suitable for low cost and high volume manufacturing. This paper reports the results of a preliminary investigation into this concept. Glass and silicon inserts of 25 times 20 mm in size, used to represent microfluidic devices, were over-molded in an injection molding process with a range of polymers. The inserts were found to survive the molding process intact. The adhesion between overmold and insert was investigated by subjecting the interface between the overmold and insert surface to a hydrostatic pressure of up to 100 lbf/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (6.9 bar). The durability of the interfacial adhesion to hydrolysis was investigated by immersion in water at 50degC for 24 h before testing. Direct measurements of adhesion strength between polymer and glass were also attempted by tensile tests on lap-jointed samples. The best and most durable adhesion for glass and silicon inserts was found for polyamide (PA) 12, which is a low hygroscopicity PA. The ranking of polymers by their performances in the pressurization tests was consistent with the ranking by the calculated work-of-adhesion values for polymer/glass and polymer/silicon joints.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2013404","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4808224/04796251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2013404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808224","startPage":"354","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packaging of Microfluidic Devices for Fluid Interconnection Using Thermoplastics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Packaging of Microfluidic Devices for Fluid Interconnection Using Thermoplastics","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10557835","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796251/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packaging of Microfluidic Devices for Fluid Interconnection Using Thermoplastics","sourcePdf":"jmems-webb-2013404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057347S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4808224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4808224","articleId":"4796251","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796260,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278570700"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281264600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4796260","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2330},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attitude control","Space vehicles","Adaptive control","Control systems","Attenuation","Robust control","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Councils","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aircraft control","robust control","space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude tracking","rigid spacecraft","adaptive control","disturbance rejection problem","sinusoidal disturbance","robust control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","nonlinear systems","space vehicle control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2008350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4799326/04796260.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2008350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attitude Tracking and Disturbance Rejection of Rigid Spacecraft by Adaptive Control","abstract":"In this technical note, we deal with the attitude tracking and disturbance rejection problem of spacecraft for a class of persistent disturbances with unbounded energy which include the sinusoidal disturbance as a special case.

The energy savings can be especially significant in cooperative transmission schemes, where several nodes cooperate during one hop to forward the information to the next node along a route to the destination. Finding the best multi-hop transmission policy in such a network which determines nodes that are involved in each hop, is a very important problem, but also a very difficult one especially when the physical wireless channel behavior is to be accounted for and exploited. We model the above optimization problem for randomly fading channels as a decentralized control problem - the channel observations available at each node define the information structure, while the control policy is defined by the power and phase of the signal transmitted by each node. In particular, we consider the problem of computing an energy-optimal cooperative transmission scheme in a wireless network for two different channel fading models: (i) slow fading channels, where the channel gains of the links remain the same for a large number of transmissions, and (ii) fast fading channels, where the channel gains of the links change quickly from one transmission to another. For slow fading, we consider a factored class of policies (corresponding to local cooperation between nodes), and show that the computation of an optimal policy in this class is equivalent to a shortest path computation on an induced graph, whose edge costs can be computed in a decentralized manner using only locally available channel state information (CSI). For fast fading, both CSI acquisition and data transmission consume energy. Hence, we need to jointly optimize over both these; we cast this optimization problem as a large stochastic optimization problem. We then jointly optimize over a set of CSI functions of the local channel states, and a corresponding factored class of control policies corresponding to local cooperation between nodes with a local outage constraint. The resulting optimal scheme in this class can again be computed efficiently in a decentralized manner. We demonstrate significant energy savings for both slow and fast fading channels through numerical simulations of randomly distributed networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796265/","accessionNumber":"10516926","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Decentralized Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Decentralized Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"54tac03-rmadan-2012979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110505S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4799326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4799326","articleId":"4796265","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796268,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

Trajectory sensitivity mapping technique is proposed to evaluate the approximate gradients of the objective function relative to the PSS parameters. With the gradients, conjugate gradient method is employed to assess the PSS parameters for minimizing the objective function.

In recent years, significant progress has been made on these 3-D technologies, and they have become probably the best hope for carrying the semiconductor industry beyond the path of Moore's law. However, a clear roadmap is missing to successfully introduce this 3-D technology onto the market. Today, a plurality of 3-D technology options exists, which requires different design and test strategies. To crystallize the many technology options in a few mainstream technologies, it is mandatory to coexplore both technology and design options. The contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel path finding methodology to untangle the many intertwined design/technology options. This holistic approach will be applied on a representative 3-D case study. Initial results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed path-finding methodology to steer the technology development and fine-tune design strategies.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007471","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4796865/04796274.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Technology Assessment: Path-Finding the Technology/Design Sweet-Spot","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"3-D Technology Assessment: Path-Finding the Technology/Design Sweet-Spot","volume":"97","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501031","htmlLink":"/document/4796274/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Technology Assessment: Path-Finding the Technology/Design Sweet-Spot","sourcePdf":"jproc-marchal-2007471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113918S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4796865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4796865","articleId":"4796274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796275,"authors":[{"name":"Makoto Motoyoshi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4796865/4796275/4796275-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Makoto Motoyoshi (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in bioengineering and robotics from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1980, 1982, and 2006, respectively.","In 1982, he joined Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, where he had been involved in the research and development of SRAM, especially high-speed SRAM.

Advanced design methodologies for two-dimensional circuits are not sufficient to manage the added complexity caused by the third dimension. Consequently, design methodologies that efficiently handle the added complexity and inherent heterogeneity of 3-D circuits are necessary. These 3-D design methodologies should support robust and reliable 3-D circuits while considering different forms of vertical integration, such as system-in-package and 3-D ICs with fine grain vertical interconnections. Global signaling issues, such as clock and power distribution networks, are further exacerbated in vertical integration due to the limited number of package pins, the distance of these pins from other planes within the 3-D system, and the impedance characteristics of the through silicon vias (TSVs). In addition to these dedicated networks, global signaling techniques that incorporate the diverse traits of complex 3-D systems are required. One possible approach, potentially significantly reducing the complexity of interconnect issues in 3-D circuits, is 3-D networks-on-chip (NoC). Design methodologies that exploit the diversity of 3-D structures to further enhance the performance of multiplane integrated systems are necessary. The longest interconnects within a 3-D circuit are those interconnects comprising several TSVs and traversing multiple physical planes. Consequently, minimizing the delay of the interplane nets is of great importance. By considering the nonuniform impedance characteristics of the interplane interconnects while placing the TSVs, the delay of these nets is decreased. In addition, the difference in electrical behavior between the horizontal and vertical interconnects suggests that asymmetric structures can be useful candidates for distributing the clock signal within a 3-D circuit. A 3-D test circuit fabricated with a 180 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, manufactured by MIT Lincoln Laboratories, exploring several clock distribution topologies is described. Correct operation at 1 GHz has been demonstrated. Several 3-D NoC topologies incorporating dissimilar 3-D interconnect structures are reviewed as a promising solution for communication limited systems-on-chip (SoC). Appropriate performance models are described to evaluate these topologies. Several forms of vertical integration, such as system-in-package and different candidate technologies for 3-D circuits, such as SOI, are considered. The techniques described in this paper address fundamental interconnect structures in the 3-D design process. Several interesting research problems in the design of 3-D circuits are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007473","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4796865/04796277.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect-Based Design Methodologies for Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect-Based Design Methodologies for Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","volume":"97","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10501025","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796277/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect-Based Design Methodologies for Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"jproc-pavlidis-2007473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139495S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4796865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4796865","articleId":"4796277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796279,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Gezici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4802183/4796279/4796279-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sinan Gezici (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2001 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2006.","From April 2006 to January 2007, he was a Visiting Member of Technical Staff with Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA.

Therefore, conventional matched filter receiver designs, which are optimal for Gaussian noise, are not fully efficient for UWB applications. Several alternative distributions for approximating the MUI process and the MUI-plus-noise process in UWB systems are motivated and compared. These distributions have in common that they are more impulsive than the Gaussian approximation, with a greater area in the tails of the probability density function (pdf) compared to a Gaussian pdf. The improved MUI and MUI-plus-noise models are utilized to derive new receiver designs for UWB applications, which are shown to be superior to the conventional matched filter receiver. Multipath propagation is abundant in UWB channels and is exploited by a Rake receiver. A Rake receiver uses multiple fingers to comb the multipath rays with a conventional matched filter implemented in each finger. Rake structures utilizing the new receiver designs that are suitable for reception of UWB signals in multipath fading channels are provided. An optimal performance benchmark, based on an accurate theoretical model for the interference that fully explains the features of the MUI pdf, is also presented. Analysis and simulation results are shown for the novel receivers, which demonstrate that the new designs have superior performance compared to the conventional linear receiver when MUI is significant. Several adaptive receivers are shown to always match or exceed the performance of the conventional linear receiver in all MUI-plus-noise environments. Parameter estimation for the new receivers also is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008782","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4802183/04796280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802183","startPage":"255","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Time-Hopping Ultrawide Bandwidth Receivers for Multiuser Interference Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796280","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Designing Time-Hopping Ultrawide Bandwidth Receivers for Multiuser Interference Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"97","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10545953","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Time-Hopping Ultrawide Bandwidth Receivers for Multiuser Interference Environments","sourcePdf":"jproc-young-2008782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073406S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4802183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"67","articleId":"4796280","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796281,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology Engineering, Faculty of Electrical, Leibniz Universitaet Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4802183/4796281/4796281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Kaiser (Senior Member, IEEE) received the diploma degree from Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, in 1991 and the Ph.D. (with distinction) and Habiliation degrees from Gerhard-Mercator-University, Duisburg, Germany, in 1995 and 2000, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1995 to 1996, he was on research leave at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, supported by the German Academic Exchange Service.

UWB is typically applied to short-range and therefore mainly indoor communications in environments characterized usually by dense multipath propagation. For this type of environment, MIMO systems allow for a substantial increase of spectral efficiency by exploiting the inherent array gain and spatial multiplexing gain of the systems. In this paper, we provide a brief overview for UWB-MIMO wireless technology. The overview covers channel capacity, space-time coding (STC), and beamforming. It is shown that the spectral efficiency is increased logarithmically and linearly\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">,</i>\n respectively, for single transmit and multiple receive antennas (SIMO) and MIMO systems. For multiple transmit and single receive antenna (MISO) systems, a threshold for the data transmission rate exists such that the spatial multiplexing gain can be obtained if the data rate is lower than this threshold, but it is not beneficial to deploy multiple transmit antennas if the required data rate is higher than the threshold. Two STC schemes for UWB-MIMO are briefly discussed, and their performance comparison is presented. A discussion about antenna selection is also presented, and the performance comparison between antenna selection and equal gain combiner is provided showing the diversity gain for some scenarios. For the beamforming, it is shown that the optimal beamformer is obtained if all the weighting filters in each antenna branch are identical. About the optimal beamformer, it is found that the amplitude of the side lobe is independent of the ray incidence angle, and the amplitude of the main lobe is increased by a fold of the element number in the array. Three kinds of beam patterns are defined, and the beamwidth of the main lobe is given. Experimental results based on an offline testbed are provided to verify some analytical results presented in this paper.

The major concern when imaging is extended to real objects is to achieve a correct reconstruction of the object shape and its electric properties. A general framework based on a UWB bifocusing operator (UWB-BF) with good tomographic imaging capabilities is presented. This general approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the basic tradeoffs with regard to sensing geometry and image quality parameters. Through numerical simulations and measurements applied to canonical as well as to complex objects, basic design criteria are assessed and the potential of UWB tomographic radar imaging is presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802183","startPage":"451","endPage":"464","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4802183/04796282.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB Tomographic Radar Imaging of Penetrable and Impenetrable Objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"UWB Tomographic Radar Imaging of Penetrable and Impenetrable Objects","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10545954","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"97","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB Tomographic Radar Imaging of Penetrable and Impenetrable Objects","sourcePdf":"jproc-jofre-2008854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055837S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4802183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"36","articleId":"4796282","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4796284,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Qiang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer, and Systems Engineering and Center of Integrated Electronics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4796865/4796284/4796284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian-Qiang (James) Lu (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Dr.rer.nat.

A significant number of these uncertainty problems falls into the dynamic optimization category in which the fitness function varies through time. For this class of problems, an evolutionary algorithm is expected to perform satisfactorily in spite of different degrees and frequencies of change in the fitness landscape. In addition, the dynamic evolutionary algorithm should warrant an acceptable performance improvement to justify the additional computational cost. Effective reuse of previous evolutionary information is a must as it facilitates a faster convergence after a change has occurred. This paper proposes a new dynamic evolutionary algorithm that uses variable relocation to adapt already converged or currently evolving individuals to the new environmental condition. The proposed algorithm relocates those individuals based on their change in function value due to the change in the environment and the average sensitivities of their decision variables to the corresponding change in the objective space. The relocation occurs during the transient stage of the evolutionary process, and the algorithm reuses as much information as possible from the previous evolutionary history. As a result, the algorithm shows improved adaptation and convergence. The newly adapted population is shown to be fitter to the new environment than the original or most randomly generated population. The algorithm has been tested by several dynamic benchmark problems and has shown competitive results compared to some chosen state-of-the-art dynamic evolutionary approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5089880/04796289.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Evolutionary Algorithm With Variable Relocation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Uncertainty","Frequency","Convergence","Portfolios","Electricity supply industry deregulation","Electricity supply industry","Job shop scheduling","Computational efficiency","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic evolutionary algorithm","real-world optimization problems","uncertainty problems","dynamic optimization category","computational cost","evolutionary information","variable relocation","randomly generated population","dynamic benchmark problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptation","dynamic evolutionary algorithm (DEA)","optimization","relocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Evolutionary Algorithm With Variable Relocation","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4796289/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10720817","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Evolutionary Algorithm With Variable Relocation","sourcePdf":"tevc-gyen-2009031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098783S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5089880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5089880","articleId":"4796289","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796290,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["Scottish Universities Physics Alliance, Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/4799262/4796290/4796290-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in applied physics from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, and the M.Sc. degree in application of nuclear techniques from the China Academy of Engineering Physics, Chengdu, China, in 2004, and 2007, respectively.

The previously developed approach has been redefined into a generalized form. The method relies on the prediction of either current or flux in discrete-time intervals and, consequently, selects the inverter voltage vector that produces the fastest possible transient. Depending on the task, two possible variants have been developed, offering a compromise between ripple in the controlled variable and switching frequency. A special effort has been made to overcome problems due to various delays (processing time, acquisition, gate driver delay, etc.) in the prediction routine, thus achieving maximum performance. The approach has been upgraded for application in AC drives, which allows additional torque control. The functional versatility of the approach has been demonstrated on different applications of power electronics (active power filter, induction machine, surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous machine). All applications have been tested on different laboratory models and have confirmed the validity of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2015749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5062301/04796297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2015749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062301","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Direct Control Applied to AC Drives and Active Power Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Direct Control Applied to AC Drives and Active Power Filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10697930","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796297/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Direct Control Applied to AC Drives and Active Power Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-nemec-2015749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103658S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5062301","articleId":"4796297","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796298,"authors":[{"name":"Patricio Cortes","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5062301/4796298/4796298-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patricio Cort\u00e9s (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in 2008 from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile.","Since 2003, he has been with the Electronics Engineering Department, UTFSM, where he is currently a Research Associate.

However, the controller design becomes more difficult. This paper presents a new and simple control scheme using predictive control for a two-level converter. The controller uses the model of the system to predict, on each sampling interval, the behavior of the output voltage for each possible switching state. Then, a cost function is used as a criterion for selecting the switching state that will be applied during the next sampling interval. In addition, an observer is used for load-current estimation, enhancing the behavior of the proposed controller without increasing the number of current sensors. Experimental results under linear and nonlinear load conditions, with a 5.5-kW prototype, are presented, verifying the feasibility and good performance of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2015750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5062301/04796298.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2015750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control of an Inverter With Output - Filter for UPS Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control of an Inverter With Output <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $LC$</tex></formula> Filter for UPS Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796298/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10713192","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796298/","volume":"56","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control of an Inverter With Output <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $LC$</tex></formula> Filter for UPS Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-cortes-2015750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11012S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"427","xplore-issue":"5062301","articleId":"4796298","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4796311,"authors":[{"name":"Vehbi C.

Given the increasing age of many industrial systems and the dynamic industrial manufacturing market, intelligent and low-cost industrial automation systems are required to improve the productivity and efficiency of such systems. The collaborative nature of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) brings several advantages over traditional wired industrial monitoring and control systems, including self-organization, rapid deployment, flexibility, and inherent intelligent-processing capability. In this regard, IWSN plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real-time events with appropriate actions. In this paper, first, technical challenges and design principles are introduced in terms of hardware development, system architectures and protocols, and software development. Specifically, radio technologies, energy-harvesting techniques, and cross-layer design for IWSNs have been discussed. In addition, IWSN standards are presented for the system owners, who plan to utilize new IWSN technologies for industrial automation applications. In this paper, our aim is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in IWSNs and discuss the still-open research issues in this field and, hence, to make the decision-making process more effective and direct.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2015754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/04796311.pdf","startPage":"4258","endPage":"4265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2015754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks: Challenges, Design Principles, and Technical Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks: Challenges, Design Principles, and Technical Approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796311/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869376","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796311/","volume":"56","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks: Challenges, Design Principles, and Technical Approaches","sourcePdf":"tie-gungor-2015754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072197S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"1064","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"4796311","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4796323,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Leonardi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4812252/4796323/4796323-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Leonardi (S'05) received the M.S. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technology from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","From November 2005 to August 2007, he was a Digital Designer and System Architect with Neuricam, Trento.

A two-time-slot cooperative channel estimation protocol is proposed. The source broadcasts the training sequence to the relays and the destination (first time slot), and the relays retransmit the training sequence (second time slot). Pilot designs for amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relays are derived. These designs eliminate interrelay interference (IRI), which occurs due to the simultaneous relay retransmissions, and minimize the mean square error (MSE). Consequently, the number of AF and DF relays is constrained to be less than lfloorN/(2L - 1)rfloor and lfloorN/Lrfloor, respectively, where N is the total number of subcarriers, L is the channel order, and lfloorarfloor is the maximum integer part of alpha. The pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal space-time coding in cooperative OFDM due to both frequency offset and channel-estimation errors is also evaluated. The optimal power allocation ratio between the source and the relays to minimize the PEP is derived for AF and DF relays. When L < 16, DF relays outperform AF relays in terms of PEP. With L = 4 and 16 active relays, the gap is 9 dB for a frequency offset error variance of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n, and this gap increases to about 11.3 dB when the variance increases to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2016345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04796336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2016345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","startPage":"3447","endPage":"3459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative OFDM Channel Estimation in the Presence of Frequency Offsets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative OFDM Channel Estimation in the Presence of Frequency Offsets","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829080","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796336/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative OFDM Channel Estimation in the Presence of Frequency Offsets","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2016345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107496S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4796336","onlineDate":"27 February 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796337,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano Galindo Leal","affiliation":["Elucid Solutions, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Adriano Galindo Leal (M'06) was born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on September 19, 1971.

There are several techniques that offer good results against single event upsets (SEUs), like single error correction-double error detection codes. However, there may be situations where these solutions are not enough, for example, when there is a large SEU arrival rate or multiple bit upsets (MBUs) are present. This last situation is becoming more frequent as technology scales, since in this case, the probability that a single event induces several errors in adjacent cells is higher. A possible solution to address this problem is the use of multibit protection codes, which are often utilized in other fields like communications. However, there are no developed models for memories that can put in perspective how these multibit protection codes behave in the presence of MBUs, and how the reliability of the system is affected by its use. In this paper, a reliability analysis of this case will be presented, studying how the proposed model behaves with respect to the traditional SEU ones and offering some applicability conditions. Both scenarios of memories with and without scrubbing will be analyzed, and several simulation results will be offered in order to prove the accuracy of the proposals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10501787","htmlLink":"/document/4796373/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study of the Effects of Multibit Error Correction Codes on the Reliability of Memories in the Presence of MBUs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the Effects of Multibit Error Correction Codes on the Reliability of Memories in the Presence of MBUs","sourcePdf":"tdmr-maestro-2007647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10922S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4796371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4796371","articleId":"4796373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4796375,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4796371/4796375/4796375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Dou Ker (S'92\u2013M'94\u2013SM'97\u2013F'08) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Electronics, National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993.","He was the Department Manager with the VLSI Design Division, Computer and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu.

It shows local dimming effects such as reduced power consumption and high dynamic contrast ratio even with much less number of LED drivers than that of the conventional 2-D local dimming method. Therefore, low cost and compact design of LED drivers can be achieved.

In this work, we model the thermal behavior of a MPSoC as a control theory problem which enables the design of an optimum frequency controller without depending on the thermal profile of the chip. The optimization performed by the controller is targeted to achieve thermal balancing on the MPSoC thermal profile to avoid hotspots and improve its reliability. The proposed system is able to perform an on-line minimization of chip thermal gradients based on both scheduler requirements and the chip thermal profile. We compare this with state of the art thermal management approaches. Our comparison shows that the proposed system offers a better both thermal profile (temperature differences higher than 4deg C have been reduced from 27.9% to 0.45%) and performance (up to 32% task waiting time reduction).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10479254","htmlLink":"/document/4796438/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A control theory approach for thermal balancing of MPSoC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A control theory approach for thermal balancing of MPSoC","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p037_1B-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050211S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4796462,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Yu Shih","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Xin-Yu Shih","id":"37571437200"},{"name":"Cheng-Zhou Zhan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Zhou Zhan","id":"37574114000"},{"name":"Cheng-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Hung Lin","id":"37278412000"},{"name":"An-Yeu Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"An-Yeu Wu","id":"37271932500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2748-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2749-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4796462","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","WiMAX","Energy consumption","Routing","Reconfigurable architectures","Delay","Hardware","Power measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","iterative methods","mobile radio","parity check codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC decoder chip","mobile WiMAX applications","efficient IC design strategy","decoding latency","hardware utilization ratio","iteration number","frequency 83.3 MHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a LDPC decoder chip supporting all 19 modes in mobile WiMAX applications.

Experimental results show that, in comparison with quick sort on a single CPU, processing time of Map Sort is comparable on a CPU and three times faster on four CPUs.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796485","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796485.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelizing fundamental algorithms such as sorting on multi-core processors for EDA acceleration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796485/","displayDocTitle":"Parallelizing fundamental algorithms such as sorting on multi-core processors for EDA acceleration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499793","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796485/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelizing fundamental algorithms such as sorting on multi-core processors for EDA acceleration","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p230_2D-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027178S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796486,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37407343000"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2748-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2749-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4796486","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":99,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1152},"abstract":"Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is emerging as an attractive option for overcoming the barriers in interconnect scaling. The majority of the existing 3D IC research is focused on how to take advantage of the performance, power, smaller form-factor, and heterogeneous integration benefits that offered by 3D integration. However, all such advantages ultimately have to translate into cost savings when a design strategy has to be decided: Is 3D integration a cost effective technology for a particular IC design? Consequently, system-level cost analysis at the early design stage is imperative to help the decision making on whether 3D integration should be adopted. In this paper, we study the design estimation method for 3D ICs at the early design stage, and propose a cost analysis model to study the cost implication for 3D ICs, and address the following cost-related problems related to 3D IC design: (1) Do all the benefits of 3D IC design come with a much higher cost? (2) How can 3D integration be achieved in a cost-effective way? (3) Are there any design options to compensate the extra 3D bonding cost? A cost-driven 3D IC design flow is also proposed to guide the design space exploration for 3D ICs toward a cost-effective direction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Integrated circuit interconnections","Design methodology","Bonding","Decision making","Through-silicon vias","CMOS technology","Computer science","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level cost analysis","system-level design exploration","three-dimensional integrated circuits","interconnect scaling","3D-IC design estimation method","3D bonding cost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796486","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796486","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796486","startPage":"234","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-level cost analysis and design exploration for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System-level cost analysis and design exploration for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796486/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796486/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499794","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-level cost analysis and design exploration for three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs)","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p234_3A-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053956S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796487,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivasan Murali","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Murali","id":"37274207100"},{"name":"Ciprian Seiculescu","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Seiculescu","id":"37391635700"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini","id":"37274443600"},{"name":"Giovanni De Micheli","affiliation":["LSI, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Micheli","id":"37274174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2748-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2749-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4796487","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Network-on-a-chip","System-on-a-chip","Switches","Delay","Topology","Energy consumption","Power system interconnection","Design methodology","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","network topology","network-on-chip","stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networks on chips","3D systems on chips","3D stacking","silicon layers","interconnect complexity","interconnect power reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D","networks on chip","topology synthesis","application-specific"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional stacking of silicon layers is emerging as a promising solution to handle the design complexity and heterogeneity of Systems on Chips (SoCs).

SSTA via Monte Carlo simulations is a computationally expensive, but important step required to achieve design timing closure. It provides an accurate estimate of delay variations and their impact on design yield. The large number of threads that can be computed in parallel on a GPU suggests a natural fit for the problem of Monte Carlo based SSTA to the GPU platform. Our implementation performs multiple delay simulations at a single gate in parallel. A parallel implementation of the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator on the GPU, followed by box-Muller transformations (also implemented on the GPU) is used for generating gate delay numbers from a normal distribution. The mu and sigma of the pin-to-output delay distributions for all inputs and for every gate, are obtained using a memory lookup, which benefits from the large memory bandwidth of the GPU. Threads which execute in parallel have no data/control dependencies on each other. All threads compute identical instructions, but on different data, as required by the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) programming semantics of the GPU. Our approach is implemented on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8800 GPU card. Our results indicate that our approach can obtain an average speedup of about 260times as compared to a serial CPU implementation. With the recently announced quad 8800 GPU cards, we estimate that our approach would attain a speedup of over 785times. The correctness of the Monte Carlo based SSTA implemented on a GPU has been verified by comparing its results with a CPU based implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796490.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating statistical static timing analysis using graphics processing units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Graphics processing unit","Monte Carlo methods","Delay","Delay estimation","Yield estimation","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","Monte Carlo methods","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical static timing analysis","graphics processing units","Monte Carlo simulations","delay variations","multiple delay simulations","box-Muller transformations","pin-to-output delay distributions","memory lookup","single instruction multiple data","SIMD programming semantics","NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8800 GPU card"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating statistical static timing analysis using graphics processing units","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796490/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499797","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating statistical static timing analysis using graphics processing units","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p260_3B-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075598S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4796494,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay V.

This approach relaxes the discrete layer assignments so that they are continuous in the z-direction and the problem can be solved by an analytical global placer. A key idea is to do the overlap removal and device layer assignment simultaneously by adding a density penalty function for both area & TS via density constraints. Experimental results show that this analytical placer in a multilevel framework is effective to achieve trade-offs between wirelength and TS via number. Compared to the recently published transformation-based 3D placement method, we are able to achieve on average 12% shorter wirelength and 29% fewer TS via compared to their cases with best wirelength; we are also able to achieve on average 20% shorter wirelength and 50% fewer TS via number compared to their cases with best TS via numbers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796507","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796507","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796507.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"366","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilevel analytical placement for 3D ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multilevel analytical placement for 3D ICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499812","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796507/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilevel analytical placement for 3D ICs","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p361_4B-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071055S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796514,"authors":[{"name":"Kanupriya Gulati","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kanupriya","lastName":"Gulati","id":"37302347000"},{"name":"John F.

Given the pivotal role of SPICE in the IC design flow, there has been significant interest in accelerating SPICE. Since a large fraction (on average 75%) of the SPICE runtime is spent in evaluating transistor model equations, a significant speedup can be availed if these evaluations are accelerated. This paper reports on our early efforts to accelerate transistor model evaluations using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We have integrated this accelerator with a commercial fast SPICE tool. Our experiments demonstrate that significant speedups (2.36times on average) can be obtained. The asymptotic speedup that can be obtained is about 4times. We demonstrate that with circuits consisting of as few as about 1000 transistors, speedups in the neighborhood of this asymptotic value can be obtained. By utilizing the recently announced (but not currently available) quad GPU systems, this speedup could be enhanced further, especially for larger designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796514.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"408","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast circuit simulation on graphics processing units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit simulation","Graphics","SPICE","Acceleration","Bandwidth","Computer displays","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis","Nonlinear equations","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","computer graphic equipment","SPICE","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","graphics processing units","SPICE","VLSI design","transistor model evaluations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast circuit simulation on graphics processing units","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796514/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499819","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast circuit simulation on graphics processing units","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p403_4C-6s.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066321S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796516,"authors":[{"name":"Nobuaki Miyakawa","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Japan Company Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuaki","lastName":"Miyakawa","id":"37371638100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2748-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2749-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4796516","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Stacking","Through-silicon vias","Contact resistance","Wet etching","Large scale integration","Electric resistance","Fabrication","Conducting materials","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit packaging","prototypes","stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D prototyping chip","wafer-level stacking technology","3-dimensional stacking technology","wafer-to-wafer stacked method","TSV","microbump","size 8 inch"]}],"abstract":"We have developed a new 3-dimensional stacking technology using wafer-to-wafer stacked method and evaluated the connectivity between TSV and micro-bump.

In this paper, we identify key stages in EDA that need modification to handle 3D ICs, highlight the challenges and review existing solutions, if they exist.

Efficient design of the MIMO detector is a challenging task. This is further compounded by the fact that 802.11n standard requires support for runtime switching between different modulation schemes (or modes). While searching for an appropriate architecture attention must be paid to application requirements such as required throughput, limits on latency, and reconfiguration between various modes of operations. Important hardware design metrics such as area/power should be optimized over all the operating modes of the detector. In this paper we carry out extensive architectural space exploration to address the issues of power consumption, area, and reconfigurability between different modes of operation while meeting the standards throughput requirement. Ultimately, we come up with two designs that target low area and low power respectively. We also maintain close to optimum bit error rate(BER), which is vital for any wireless system. The design estimates are based on 45 nm technology library.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796570","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","startPage":"751","endPage":"756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array like runtime reconfigurable MIMO detectors for 802.11n WLAN: A design case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Array like runtime reconfigurable MIMO detectors for 802.11n WLAN: A design case study","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796570/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10499869","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796570/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array like runtime reconfigurable MIMO detectors for 802.11n WLAN: A design case study","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p751_8B-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076996S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4796582,"authors":[{"name":"Minki Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Minki","lastName":"Cho","id":"37401638700"},{"name":"Jason Schlessman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Schlessman","id":"37565565100"},{"name":"Wayne Wolf","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37284351200"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2748-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2749-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"4796582","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796582","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Voltage","Circuits","Mobile computing","Manufacturing","Image processing","Power dissipation","Bit error rate","Read-write memory","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","mobile radio","multimedia communication","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power SRAM architecture","mobile multimedia applications","cells storing higher order bit","memory power","image quality degradation","accuracy-aware SRAM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796582","endPage":"828","startPage":"823","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy-aware SRAM: A reconfigurable low power SRAM architecture for mobile multimedia applications","abstract":"We propose a dynamically reconfigurable SRAM architecture for low-power mobile multimedia applications.

In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the impact of design parameters on parametric failures due to process variations. To achieve high memory yield without incurring expensive technology modification, we developed an alternate design paradigm -circuit/architecture co-design - to take advantage of different levels of design hierarchy (circuit and architecture) to improve the yield and memory density.

Thus, researchers have started looking at alternative technologies. Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata (MQCA) is such an alternative with switching energy close to thermal limits and scalability down to 5 nm. In this paper, we present a circuit/architecture design methodology using MQCA. Novel clocking techniques and strategies are developed to improve computation robustness of MQCA systems. We also developed an integrated device/circuit/system compatible simulation framework to evaluate the functionality and the architecture of an MQCA based system and conducted a feasibility/comparison study to determine the effectiveness of MQCAs in digital electronics. Simulation results of an 8-bit MQCA-based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with novel clocking and architecture show up to 290X and 46X improvement (at iso-delay and optimistic assumption) over 45 nm CMOS in energy consumption and area, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796586","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","startPage":"847","endPage":"852","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4781528/4796414/04796586.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design methodology and device/circuit/architecture compatible simulation framework for low-power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Magnetic circuits","Circuit simulation","Magnetic devices","Quantum cellular automata","CMOS technology","Computer architecture","Clocks","Computational modeling","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","clock and data recovery circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","integrated logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power magnetic quantum cellular automata systems","CMOS device scaling","circuit design methodology","architecture design methodology","integrated device/circuit/architecture simulation framework","digital electronics","MQCA-based discrete cosine transform","clocking architecture","logic isolation","noise immunity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A design methodology and device/circuit/architecture compatible simulation framework for low-power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10499885","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796586/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796586/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design methodology and device/circuit/architecture compatible simulation framework for low-power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata systems","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"p847_9B-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039783S","chronDate":"19-22 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4781528","isNumber":"4796414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4781528","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4796414","articleId":"4796586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796601,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Lai","affiliation":["BeingAMC, Inc., Saratoga, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Lai","id":"38247029000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2377-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2378-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"}],"articleNumber":"4796601","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1466},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-volatile memory technologies: The quest for ever lower cost","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Costs","Flash memory","Technological innovation","Moore's Law","Lithography","Silicon","Probes","Cellular phones","Universal Serial Bus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost reduction","flash memories","NAND circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonvolatile memory technologies","NAND flash memory cost reduction","Moore's Law","multilevel cell capabilities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796601","abstract":"Growth of flash memory business over last 20 years was driven by never ending reduction of memory cost through Moore's Law and innovations, and the quest for ever lower cost will continue for many years to come. This review begins with a brief summary of trend of flash memory cost reduction up to now. Then some of the improvement efforts on existing technologies reported by industry will be discussed. NAND flash will continue to be the cost reduction driver in next few years but will face increasing level of difficulties. Innovations will enable the trend to continue. For longer term, industry is developing new memory technologies that have promise to deliver ever lower cost. Some more mature new technology concepts will be discussed in this review. General direction is to go to multi-layer memories with multi-level cell capabilities. There are also alternative approaches like probe based storage. Enhancement from system level solution will help existing technologies as well as facilitating introduction of new technologies. It is expected that products from few new technologies will take off in coming years to enable continuation of cost reduction of non-volatile memories, meeting insatiable demand of existing devices for more memory capacity at lower cost, as well as creating new devices and new markets.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796601","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-volatile memory technologies: The quest for ever lower cost","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796601/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10479631","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-volatile memory technologies: The quest for ever lower cost","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067573S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796607,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

CMP was first used in the early 1990s for BEOL metallization to replanarize the wafer substrate thus enabling advanced lithography which was becoming ever more sensitive to wafer surface topography. Subsequent uses of CMP included density scaling via shallow trench isolation and interconnect formation via copper CMP. As silicon devices scale to 45 nm and beyond however, a large number of new uses of CMP are considered attractive options to enable new transistor technologies. These new uses will demand improved CMP performance (uniformity, topography, low defects) at lower cost which will in turn require breakthroughs in hardware, software, metrology and materials (slurry, pad, cleaning chemicals). This paper reviews the module level and integration challenges of applying traditional CMP steps to enable Hi-K metal gate for 45 nm technology and to advance Cu metallization from 65 nm to 45 nm node. These challenges are then considered with respect to new CMP applications considered for 32 nm and beyond.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796607.pdf","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chemical mechanical polish: The enabling technology","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796607","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Chemical mechanical polish: The enabling technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796607/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10479636","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4796607/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chemical mechanical polish: The enabling technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035455S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4796618,"authors":[{"name":"T.

RRAM (Resistance Random Access Memory) has provided advantages in fabrication which have made these works possible. Therefore we also suggest methods and techniques for improving the distribution in bi-stable resistance characteristics of the NiO memory node. In order to fabricate stack structures, all device fabrication steps must be possible at low temperatures. The benefits provided by low temperature processes are demonstrated by our devices fabricated over glass substrates. Our paper shows the device characteristics of each individual component as well as the characteristics of combined select transistor with 1D-1R cell. XPS analysis of NiO RRAM resistance layer deposited by ALD confirms similar conclusions to previous reports of the importance of metallic Ni content in sputtered NiO for bistable resistance switching.

By adopting confined CVD-PCM, we were able to reduce the reset current below ~160 muA and to obtain high reliability. In addition, the programming time of dash-confined cell was much improved to 50 ns due to volume confinement of PCM cell.

We show experimental evidence that the set process is initiated by threshold switching, that is a reversible electronic transition to a high conductance state. We develop set/reset models for prediction of programming voltage and time under sweep or pulsed conditions. The speed limitations of RRAMs are then assessed by a detailed study of reset operation in the pulsed regime, showing evidence for over-reset under high-voltage, fast programming conditions (< 1 mus).","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796678","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796678.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evidence for threshold switching in the set process of NiO-based RRAM and physical modeling for set, reset, retention and disturb prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evidence for threshold switching in the set process of NiO-based RRAM and physical modeling for set, reset, retention and disturb prediction","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796678/","accessionNumber":"10500527","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evidence for threshold switching in the set process of NiO-based RRAM and physical modeling for set, reset, retention and disturb prediction","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055398S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796679,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We observed that the TVV of C-incorporated TiN devices was dominated by RDF, indicating that the additional factor due to the metal gate had been diminished.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of additional factors in threshold voltage variability of metal/high-k gate stacks and its reduction by controlling crystalline structure and grain size in the metal gates","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796707","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796707.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of additional factors in threshold voltage variability of metal/high-k gate stacks and its reduction by controlling crystalline structure and grain size in the metal gates","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796707/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10500551","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of additional factors in threshold voltage variability of metal/high-k gate stacks and its reduction by controlling crystalline structure and grain size in the metal gates","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"16-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040321S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4796712,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Most problematic of all is the statistical variability introduced by the discreteness of charge and granularity of matter in transistors with features already of molecular dimensions [i]. Two transistors next to each other on the chip with exactly the same geometries and strain distributions may have characteristics from each end of a wide statistical distribution. In conjunction with statistical variability [ii], negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and/or hot carrier degradation can result in acute statistical reliability problems. It already profoundly affects SRAM design, and in logic circuits causes statistical timing problems and is increasingly leading to hard digital faults. In both cases, statistical variability restricts supply voltage scaling, adding to power dissipation problems [iii]. In this invited paper we describe recent advances in predictive physical simulation of statistical variability using drift diffusion (DD), Monte Carlo (MC) and quantum transport (QT) simulation techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796712","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796712.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796712","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced simulation of statistical variability and reliability in nano CMOS transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Advanced simulation of statistical variability and reliability in nano CMOS transistors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796712/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10500555","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced simulation of statistical variability and reliability in nano CMOS transistors","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"17-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039242S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796715,"authors":[{"name":"Hei Kam","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"lastName":"Hei Kam","id":"37397934800"},{"name":"Tsu-Jae King-Liu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"lastName":"Tsu-Jae King-Liu","id":"38193584100"},{"name":"Elad Alon","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Alon","id":"37270360800"},{"name":"Mark Horowitz","affiliation":["Department of EE, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Horowitz","id":"37270364000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2377-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2378-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-1918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-017X"}],"articleNumber":"4796715","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796715","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MOSFET circuits","Delay","CMOS technology","Switches","Threshold voltage","Leakage current","Circuit synthesis","Energy efficiency","Adhesives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit-level requirements","MOSFET-replacement devices","power consumption","continued CMOS scaling","switching device","circuit-level metrics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796715","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786613/4796592/04796715.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-level requirements for MOSFET-replacement devices","abstract":"Power consumption has grown to be the dominant challenge for continued CMOS scaling. This issue can be traced directly to the fact that the thermal voltage kBT/q does not scale, limiting the extent to which the MOSFET threshold voltage and hence the supply voltage (f/dd) can be scaled. To circumvent this limit, alternative switching device designs [1,2] which can achieve <60 mV/dec subthreshold swing (S) have been proposed and demonstrated.

We have experimentally demonstrated a Double-Gate, Strained-Ge, Heterostructure Tunneling FET (TFET) exhibiting very high drive currents and SS<60 mV/dec. Due to small bandgap of s-Ge and the electrostatics of the DG structure, record high drive current of 300 uA/um (the highest ever reported experimentally for a TFET) and a subthreshold slope of ~50 mV/dec was observed. In addition, to address the ambipolar problem and examine the scalability of TFETs, we have developed a sophisticated TFET simulator that uses a Quantum transport model, Non-local BTBT, complete Bandstructure (real and complex) information, and includes all transitions (direct and phonon assisted). Using this simulator, we have studied the scalability of three asymmetric DG TFET configurations (underlapped drain, lower drain doping and lateral heterostructure) in terms of their ability to solve the ambipolar behavior and achieve high ON and low OFF currents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796839/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796839/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10500657","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Double-Gate Strained-Ge Heterostructure Tunneling FET (TFET) With record high drive currents and \u226a60mV/dec subthreshold slope","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-Gate Strained-Ge Heterostructure Tunneling FET (TFET) With record high drive currents and \u226a60mV/dec subthreshold slope","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"35-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131806S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786613","isNumber":"4796592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786613","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"4796592","articleId":"4796839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796867,"authors":[{"name":"Alfonso Maurelli","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics s.r.l., Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4796865/4796867/4796867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfonso Maurelli was born in Naples, Italy, in 1960.

Like for the Yin and Yang, symbol of the equilibrium for the Taoist philosophy, the two opposites divide the circle of the life, with a piece of each in the other.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007453","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4796865/04796867.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SoC and SiP, the Yin and Yang of the Tao for the New Electronic Era","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"SoC and SiP, the Yin and Yang of the Tao for the New Electronic Era","volume":"97","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10501038","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796867/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796867/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SoC and SiP, the Yin and Yang of the Tao for the New Electronic Era","sourcePdf":"jproc-maurelli-2007453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053342S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4796865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4796865","articleId":"4796867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4796877,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4796865/4796877/4796877-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tong Zhang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2002.","Currently he is an Associate Professor in the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.

In addition, event-driven protocols borrowed from the consumer world (as IEEE802.11 or IEEE802.15.4) are not well suited for some industrial applications. In this paper, authors present the design and the experimental evaluation of a wireless real-time communication protocol that tries to overcome these limits. It exploits standard hardware to lower cost and implements a hybrid medium access strategy. Time Division Multiple Access scheduling is used to ensure time deadlines respect, while Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is used for acyclic communications, as those involved in network management.

From 1963 to 1966, he studied as a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Moscow University.","In 1958, he joined the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, where he was a Professor Emeritus with the Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science. He published six books and over 200 papers and served in many professional organizations throughout his career. In his pursuit of truth, he was never afraid of putting his reputation on the line and challenging the establishment and the status quo. Trained as a mathematician, he never ceased to seek solutions to the pressing problems of the world in which we live.","Prof. Han was a leading scholar in China for over five decades, receiving numerous prestigious awards, recognitions, and joint appointments at various universities and research institutes.","Message from the Editor-in-Chief","Prof. Jingqing Han was a control theorist and educator who inspired generations of students and colleagues in China. He passed away on April 21, 2008 in Beijing, China, at age 71. He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Pei Renshun, three grandchildren, and his sons, Xuefeng and Xuejun, along with his daughter, Xuehua (Sarah Young), scattered across both sides of the Pacific in China, Japan, and California, working in concert with his followers to keep his legacy alive.","Prof. Han was known to be an independent thinker who made bold moves in his illustrious career several times over, while making important contributions in several distinct areas of study, including optimal control, game theory, guidance and navigation, population growth, computer-aided control system design, and, above all, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). Perhaps, he made his boldest move in 1989 when, upon reflecting on the several decades of research worldwide and contemplating a seemingly unbridgeable gap between theory and practice, he categorically rejected the basic premise of mathematization of the world and the pure deductive reasoning in research, in a paper titled \u201cIs it a Control Theory or Is it a Model Theory?\u201d In the following two decades, until his death, he devoted his life to finding an alternative, and find it he did, in ADRC, which turns modern control theory on its head. The implication of this change of direction proved to be enormous both in theory and practice, as hundreds of papers and a wide range of applications and patents soon followed.","Born on November 1, 1937 to a poor peasant family of Korean decent in Changbai, Jilin Province, a remote corner of China, Han first rose to prominence in China and beyond through his eye-opening work, in collaboration with Jian Song, on \u201cAnalysis and Synthesis of Time Optimal Control System,\u201d presented at the 3rd International Federation of Automatic Control World Congress in Moscow in 1963. Interrupted by the Cultural Revolution, he nonetheless returned afterward to lead a nationwide program introducing modern control theory to a generation of scholars and educators in China whose contact with the West had been cut off for over a decade. As a leading researcher, he continued to make original contributions, such as \u201cthe constructive method\u201d in linear system theory, which establishes an intimate connection between the state space representation and the polynomial matrix one, unlike anything available in the West.","Prof. Han had a truly active and curious mind that refused to be bound by artificial boundaries; his work transcends the distinctions between linear and nonlinear systems, time-varying and time-invariant dynamics, modeling error and external disturbances, etc., classifications that often box a researcher in for life. He was a true inspiration to all who knew him, particularly his students and long-time collaborators. With his passing, the continuation of the ADRC legacy seems to largely fall on the shoulders of two groups, one headed by Huang Yi in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the other by Zhiqiang Gao at Cleveland State University.","Prof. Bogdan M.

ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2011621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2011621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4796879/04796887.pdf","startPage":"900","endPage":"906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From PID to Active Disturbance Rejection Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2009","displayDocTitle":"From PID to Active Disturbance Rejection Control","volume":"56","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4796887/","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10479737","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796887/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From PID to Active Disturbance Rejection Control","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2011621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064737S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4796879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"2839","xplore-issue":"4796879","articleId":"4796887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4796889,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel J.

Multicast routing plays a significant role in MANETs. In recent years, various multicast routing protocols with distinguishing feature have been newly proposed. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of these multicast routing protocols designed for MANETs and pave the way for the further research, a survey of the multicast routing protocols is discussed in detail in this paper.

In this paper, a feasible radio frequency (RF) bandpass sampling architecture of single-channel SDR receiver is proposed. The tradeoff between the sampling frequency and resolution of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the selectivity and tunability of the bandpass filter provides a natural way to alleviate the design challenge of RF bandpass filter. The passband of the bandpass filter can be wider than the bandwidth of the desired signal, resulting in increasing the sampling frequency and resolution. The minimum acceptable sampling frequency is based on the bandwidth of the signal and the passband of the bandpass filter. The out-of-band interferences are further attenuated in digital domain. The signal can be decimated by sample rate conversion after it has been converted to baseband to reduce the processing rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796959/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501269","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Feasible RF Bandpass Sampling Architecture of Single-Channel Software-Defined Radio Receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feasible RF Bandpass Sampling Architecture of Single-Channel Software-Defined Radio Receiver","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037898S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4796959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4796961,"authors":[{"name":"Jianli Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Jianli","lastName":"Xie","id":"37292000700"},{"name":"Cuiran Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Cuiran","lastName":"Li","id":"37291261500"},{"name":"Chengshu Li","affiliation":["Modern Telecommunication Institute of Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Chengshu","lastName":"Li","id":"37291261600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796961","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Quantization","Performance loss","Chromium","Bandwidth","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Telecommunication computing","Telecommunication congestion control","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing scheme","cognitive radios","radio spectrum congestion","cooperative spectrum sensing","credibility factor sensing algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796961","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.200","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is viewed as a possible solution to the problem of radio spectrum congestion. CR is the promising radio technology which aims to detect and utilize the temporally unused spectrum bands by sensing its radio environment in order to improve spectrum utilization. To enhance the sensing performance, cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed. However, when the number of cognitive user tends to be very large, the bandwidth for reporting sensing results to the common receiver will be very huge. In the paper, we therefore introduce a new credibility factor sensing (CFS) algorithm with quantization to decrease the average number of sensing bits to the common receiver. According to the energy detection, if the energy is located in the \"decision\" region, then the cognitive user sends 1 bit or 2 bits quantization for reporting its sensing result based on credibility factor and likelihood decision. Otherwise, the cognitive user sends nothing. Performance evaluations clearly reveal that the average number of sensing bits decreases greatly without noticeable loss in sensing performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","startPage":"83","endPage":"87","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04796961.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4796961/","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501271","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053259S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4796961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4796963,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Yong","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Yong","id":"37634461000"},{"name":"Jang Hong","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Jang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37672572700"},{"name":"Huang Yu Qing","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Huang Yu","lastName":"Qing","id":"38192165900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796963","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Genetic algorithms","Immune system","Chromium","Bit error rate","Design optimization","Libraries","Energy consumption","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","cognitive radio","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio wireless parameters design","multiobjective immune genetic algorithm","cognitive radio wireless parameter optimization","multiobjective optimization problem","NSGA-II","multiobjective functions","control module","optimal design","IEEE 802.11a physical platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["immune response","multi-objective optimization","cognitive radio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796963","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.186","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) wireless parameter optimization is a typical multi-objective optimization problem.

Numerical results show that a significant bit error rate performance improvement can be achieved over the direct transmission while both the SIC at each receive user and the power control at the stronger transmit user are considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04796990.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Relay-Assisted Transmission Technique for Multihop TDD-CDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Spread spectrum communication","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Power system relaying","Fading","Wideband","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay-assisted transmission technique","multihop TDD-CDMA network","direct sequence code-division multiple-access system","near-far effect","wideband multihop time-division duplex","interference cancellation scheme","power control","one-relay multihop cooperative network","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-access relay channel","cooperative diversity","TDD-CDMA","power control","successive interference cancellation (SIC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Relay-Assisted Transmission Technique for Multihop TDD-CDMA Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4796990/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501300","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Relay-Assisted Transmission Technique for Multihop TDD-CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043649S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4796990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4796991,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng Rong","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunication, Hangzhou Dianzi University, China"],"firstName":"Zeng","lastName":"Rong","id":"37882585200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796991","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Detection algorithms","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Wireless communication","Communication standards","Downlink","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","code division multiple access","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","active codes detection algorithm","TD-SCDMA systems","3G wireless communication standards","3GPP","ITU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","code detection","TD-SCDMA"]}],"abstract":"TD-SCDMA is one of the 3G wireless communication standards accepted by ITU and 3GPP.

In particular, we obtain closed-form expressions for channel capacity of orthogonalized Weibull MIMO channels under these adaptive transmission techniques. This capacity provides an upper bound on spectral efficiency using these techniques and avoids Monte-Carlo simulations. Moreover, we also examine the effects of the fading severity on the concerned quantities. The figures show that our theoretical results of channel capacity line up exactly with the simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04796993.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of Weibull Fading MIMO Channels under Different Adaptive Transmission Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weibull fading channels","MIMO","Closed-form solution","Channel capacity","Capacity planning","Transmitters","Mobile communication","Block codes","Wireless communication","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","space-time codes","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Weibull fading MIMO channels","adaptive transmission techniques","space-time block codes","multiple-input multiple-out wireless channels","optimal rate adaptation","constant transmit power","channel inversion","closed-form expressions","channel capacity","orthogonalized Weibull MIMO channels","Monte-Carlo simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of Weibull Fading MIMO Channels under Different Adaptive Transmission Techniques","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4796993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501303","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of Weibull Fading MIMO Channels under Different Adaptive Transmission Techniques","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097134S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4796993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4796994,"authors":[{"name":"Hancheng Liao","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Hancheng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37289382800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796994","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational modeling","Multiple access interference","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sphere decoding joint detector","multiple input multiple output LAS-CDMA system","detection complexity","signal-to-noise ratio","zero forcing detection"]}],"abstract":"In order to further decrease the detection complexity, a joint detection method based on both zero forcing and sphere decoding is proposed.

In this paper, we show that the clipping noise and PAPR are weakly related when the clipping threshold is low where the impact of clipping is large. However,the popular PAPR reduction schemes are only effective when the threshold is high.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04796998.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"269","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4796998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Clipping Noise and PAPR in the OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Bit error rate","Partial transmit sequences","Noise reduction","Mobile communication","Degradation","Error analysis","Transmitters","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","limiters","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clipping noise","OFDM system","peak to average power ratio","nonlinear amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clipping noise","PAPR","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4796998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Clipping Noise and PAPR in the OFDM System","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4796998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501308","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Clipping Noise and PAPR in the OFDM System","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05196S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4796998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4796999,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"38189616600"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37270835500"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4796999","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Genetic algorithms","OFDM modulation","Downlink","Bit error rate","Constraint optimization","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Computer networks","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","multiuser OFDM system","genetic algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high downlink capacities","cellular systems","wireless local area network systems","adaptive power allocation","channel-to-noise ratio","proportional fairness constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GA","MU-OFDM","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-OFDM) is a promising technique for achieving high downlink capacities in future cellular and wireless local area network systems.

The two operation modes are automatic switched according to the equalizer output error level. Combined with step-size parameter variation online in each mode, the blind equalization solution can converge rapidly with low residual tap fluctuation noise.

On the other hand, the phase rotation introduced by channel is corrected simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.34","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04797019.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Mode Blind Equalization Algorithm for High-Order QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797019/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Mode Blind Equalization Algorithm for High-Order QAM","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501329","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797019/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Mode Blind Equalization Algorithm for High-Order QAM","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054794S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4797019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4797021,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhua Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Microsystems, Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Shuhua","lastName":"Hu","id":"38188295600"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Microsystems, Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37293373200"},{"name":"Jiaqing Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37311438400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797021","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Circuits","Mobile communication","Table lookup","Tuning","Frequency","Costs","Oscillators","GSM","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","convertors","digital arithmetic","network synthesis","radiofrequency oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["designing NCO circuit","mobile communication systems","coordinate rotation digital computer","CORDIC","numerically controlled oscillator","digital down converters","GSM applications","Synopsys EDA tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication","NCO","CORDIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797021","abstract":"In this paper, we present an algorithm named coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) for designing the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) used in digital down converters (DDC) of GSM applications.

We demonstrate empirically that DCT is good for sinusoid oscillatory data while wavelet is good for data with point-like singularities. Furthermore, comparison on reconstruction algorithms shows basis pursuit (BP) is best in term of PSNR performance and computing time.

Computer simulation shows that the proposed method has strong capability for recognition of higher order modulation signals in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4796933/04797040.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796933","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Blind Recognition Algorithm for Modulated M-QAM Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal analysis","AWGN","Timing","Classification algorithms","Roaming","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","pattern clustering","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind recognition algorithm","modulated M-QAM signals","Hilbert transform","instantaneous amplitude calculation","subtractive clustering algorithm","modulation order","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["M-QAM","Blind Modulation Recognition","Software Defined Radio","Baud Rate Estimation","Subtractive Clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Blind Recognition Algorithm for Modulated M-QAM Signals","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4797040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501350","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Blind Recognition Algorithm for Modulated M-QAM Signals","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501a461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046581S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4796933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4796933","articleId":"4797040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4797077,"authors":[{"name":"Jansilp Aksiripipatkul","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Jansilp","lastName":"Aksiripipatkul","id":"38055018200"},{"name":"Raungrong Suleesathira","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Raungrong","lastName":"Suleesathira","id":"37270683600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797077","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Media Access Protocol","MIMO","Ad hoc networks","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","OFDM","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum selective decoding","MAC protocol","MIMO ad-hoc networks","IEEE 802.11 MAC design","interference","simultaneous transmissions collision","minimum mean-squared error technique","ML decoding","Alamouti coding","network utilization","decoding schemes","theoretical channel capacity","simulation results","OSDS-MAC system","MIMA-MAC system","single data stream"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MAC protocol","minimum mean squared errors","channel capacity","Alamouti coding"]}],"abstract":"IEEE 802.11 MAC designs encounter two problems: (1) interferences from neighboring nodes or from hidden nodes and (2) collision from simultaneous transmissions within the same contention floors. This paper presents the optimum selective decoding schemes in MAC protocol (OSDS-MAC) for MIMO Ad-hoc network. It is able to mitigate interferences by using a developed minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) technique. This interference mitigation combined to ML decoding schemes for the Alamouti coding achieves to receive and differentiate the data streams from other co-channel users. As a result, it allows a pair of simultaneous transmissions to the same or different receivers which increase the network utilization. Moreover, the presented three decoding schemes are optimally selected corresponding to the three structures determined by the number of RTSs and the type of CTS packets. Both theoretical channel capacity and simulation results show that the proposed OSDS-MAC system outperforms the MIMA-MAC system for the cases of (1) single data stream and (2) two independent data streams which are simultaneously transmitted from the two transmitters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Selective Decoding Schemes in MAC Protocol for MIMO Ad-Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.160","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4797067/04797077.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797067","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Selective Decoding Schemes in MAC Protocol for MIMO Ad-Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4797077/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Selective Decoding Schemes in MAC Protocol for MIMO Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501b003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038542S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4797067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4797067","articleId":"4797077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4797085,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Yong","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yong","id":"38186442600"},{"name":"Wang Lifeng","affiliation":["Institute of China Electronic system Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Lifeng","id":"38187613200"},{"name":"Yu Quan","affiliation":["Institute of China Electronic system Engineering Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Quan","id":"37069808900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797085","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Mobile communication","Computer architecture","Systems engineering and theory","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Mobile computing","Computer networks","Programmable logic arrays","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","case-based reasoning","multimedia communication","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer architecture","cognitive ad hoc networks","wireless environment","data flow","network resources utilization","cognitive module","multimedia services","cognitive crosslayer architecture","case-based reasoning"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Architecture in Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797067","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4797067/04797085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.142","startPage":"47","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797085","abstract":"In this paper, we proposes a cognitive cross-layer architecture for the cognitive ad hoc networks, where each node in the networks can sense and learn from wireless environment, network environment and user's requirements, and then it will respond the changes of environment by adapting system parameters and network services based on the learned results.

In this paper, we present ED-TDMA, an event driven TDMA protocol for wireless sensor network. It improves channel utility by changing the length of TDMA frame according to the number of source nodes and saves energy with bitmap-assisted TDMA schedule. In addition, ED-TDMA employs intra-cluster coverage to prolong network lifetime and to improve system scalability.

Comparison between MPHC and prime hop codes (PHCs) regarding the beat noise indicates that MPHC is very suitable for the proposed incoherent system.","doi":"10.1109/CMC.2009.102","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI International Conference on Communications and Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796932/4797067/04797180.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMC.2009.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Performance of Spectrum-Sliced Incoherent 2-D FFH-OCDMA Systems Using Modified Prime-hop Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797180/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Performance of Spectrum-Sliced Incoherent 2-D FFH-OCDMA Systems Using Modified Prime-hop Codes","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10501478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797180/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Performance of Spectrum-Sliced Incoherent 2-D FFH-OCDMA Systems Using Modified Prime-hop Codes","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"3501b531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073863S","chronDate":"6-8 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4796932","isNumber":"4797067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796932","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4797067","articleId":"4797180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797181,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Communication and Communication Networks Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yan","id":"38187793400"},{"name":"Kun Qiu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Communication and Communication Networks Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37320319600"},{"name":"Yun Ling","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Optical Fiber Communication and Communication Networks Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Ling","id":"38187495600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3501-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797181","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Phase noise","Multiaccess communication","Optical polarization","Bit error rate","Optical receivers","Optical fiber networks","Gold","Optical fiber polarization","Arrayed waveguide gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","code division multiple access","error statistics","Gaussian processes","interference (signal)","optical communication","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beat noise analysis","phase encode optical code division multiple access system","embedded polarization","phase-encoded optical code division multi-access system model","Gaussian-approximation method","bit error rate","Gold sequence","interference signals"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a phase-encoded optical code division multi-access (PE-OCDMA) system model is proposed.

The spacecrafts in orbit may undergo differential disturbances from gravitational perturbation due to Earth's oblateness, atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure and so on, consequently these effects have to be taken into account in order to implement formation reconfiguration. Whereas the consumption of fuel on board is one of the key formation reconfiguration problems, it is important to have a formation with saving fuel for orbit maintenance, whilst collision avoidance is also a significant constraint condition on formation reconfiguration. In order to deal with these challenges, many methods have been considered. With a view to tackle these problems, the present study is carried out. The nonlinear equations of relative motion on formation flying are investigated and the same geometry and mass of spacecrafts are assumed in this present paper. In this model the disturbances coming from the non spherical Earth is more important than others and then considered. In the present study, optimal controllers based on genetic algorithms are developed for spacecraft formation reconfiguration including the constraints of minimum fuel, avoiding collision and final configuration. Genetic algorithms (GA) are especially powerful techniques for the research of optimal control, GA are such methods that may be used to solve search and optimization problems. They are based on the genetic evolution process of biological organisms, over many generations, natural populations evolved according to the principles of natural selection, by mimicking this process, GA are able to evolve solutions to real world problems. The numerical results were be analyzed that demonstrated the good performance of the control strategy proposed for reconfiguration. The method proposed may be viable for future space mission.","doi":"10.1109/ICCMS.2009.54","pdfPath":"/iel5/4797333/4797334/04797362.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"98","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Modeling and Simulation","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Modeling and Simulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCMS.2009.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Formation Reconfiguration Using Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Formation Reconfiguration Using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10501635","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797362/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Formation Reconfiguration Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"3562a095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058064S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4797333","isNumber":"4797334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4797333","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4797334","articleId":"4797362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4797411,"authors":[{"name":"Naiyue Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Financial Inf.

As Ji Soo Yi and his colleagues point out, although a few definitions of insight exist, no commonly accepted definition has emerged in the community.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4797503/04797511.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MCG.2009.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2009.22","startPage":"14","endPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defining Insight for Visual Analytics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797511/","displayDocTitle":"Defining Insight for Visual Analytics","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797511/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10503084","pubMedId":"19462629","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"March-April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defining Insight for Visual Analytics","sourcePdf":"mcg2009020014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076776S","chronDate":"March-April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"38","isNumber":"4797503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4797503","articleId":"4797511","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797518,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Min Chou","affiliation":["Ching Yun University of Technology, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chang-Min Chou is an associate professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Ching Yun University.

The proposed scheme has the following advantages: it is invariant to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling operations. These operations do not change the integrity of the original model and should not be regarded as malicious attacks. The proposed method is public- the receiver does not need the original model and watermarks for authentication. It can locate changed regions. Distortion caused by the watermark embedding is controlled by the key settings according to the users' precision requirement.

Thus, it is meaningful to consider a spectrum of techniques that reflect different constraints and tradeoffs of hardware investment, computational complexity, set-up cost, and positioning accuracy. The present paper strives to achieve high accuracy with low hardware investment and moderate set-up cost, but with somewhat sophisticated computations. We not only describe a successful positioning system, but also suggest a set of formal techniques that proved to work well in the real setting, and can be implemented using standard wireless sensor network hardware. The overall philosophy of utilizing the full distribution information of signal measurements at each location (proved implementable after careful algorithm design) distinguishes sharply from most existing works. Compared with the earlier work within our group, the present paper introduces new elements such as profiling the signal measurement distributions over the coverage area using a special interpolation technique; a two-tier tracking scheme that improves the efficiency of localization (in the commonly used sense) by adding movement detection (lower energy cost); and the joint clusterhead placement optimization for both localization and movement detection. Experimentally, our system achieved an accuracy equivalent to 95% < 5 meters and 87% < 3 meters, which should be considered a high-quality result compared to well-known contemporary systems that use similar low-cost hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797528/","accessionNumber":"10501040","displayDocTitle":"Landmark-based position and movement detection of wireless sensor network devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Landmark-based position and movement detection of wireless sensor network devices","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156934S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4797531,"authors":[{"name":"Sameer Pawar","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Pawar","id":"37528652600"},{"name":"Amir Salman Avestimehr","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amir Salman","lastName":"Avestimehr","id":"38558026800"},{"name":"David N C.

The energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding.

Our analysis explicitly accounts for the feedback overhead by assuming a time division duplex system in which all feedback and data transmission must occur with a coherence time. As the fraction of coherence time devoted to feedback increases, the base station can allocate resources more efficiently, but has less time available for data transmission. In the proposed scheme, the base-station sequentially receives feedback from the users and decides when to stop receiving additional feedback and begin data transmission. Each user feeds back their best codeword (beam) selected from a beam-forming codebook on each group of OFDM sub-channels, provided that the channel gain exceeds a given threshold. For a given feedback threshold, the optimal stopping rule used by the base station is derived. With this rule we show that the total throughput of this scheme scales linearly with the number of users, provided that the number of OFDM sub-channels also scales with fixed ratio. The effect of varying the coherence time and feedback rate is also characterized.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797547","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797547.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive limited feedback scheme for MIMO-OFDMA based on optimal stopping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797547/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive limited feedback scheme for MIMO-OFDMA based on optimal stopping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797547/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive limited feedback scheme for MIMO-OFDMA based on optimal stopping","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048612S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4797556,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Counter braids has a layered structure and compresses the flow sizes as it counts. It has been shown that with a maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm, the number of bits needed to store the size of a flow matches the entropy lower bound. As ML decoding is too complex to implement, an efficient message passing decoding algorithm has been proposed for practical purposes. The layers of Counter Braids are decoded sequentially, from the most significant to the least significant bits. In each layer, the message passing decoder solves a sparse signal recovery problem. In this paper we analyze the threshold dimensionality reduction rate (d-rate) of the message passing algorithm, and prove that it is correctly predicted by density evolution.

We address this subject by introducing a layered erasure broadcast channel model in which each component channel has a state that specifies the received signal levels in an instance of a deterministic binary expansion channel. We find the capacity region of this class of broadcast channels. The inner bound assigns each signal level to the user that derives the maximum expected rate from that level. The outer bound is based on a channel enhancement that creates a degraded broadcast channel for which the capacity region is known.

The two receivers have a relationship defined by the local structure of the underlying graphical model, and are inhibited by the same phenomenon, which we call pseudoconfigurations. This concept is a generalization of the concept of pseudocodewords for linear codes. It is proved that the LP receiver has the dasiaoptimum certificatepsila property, and that the receiver output is the lowest cost pseudoconfiguration. Equivalence of graph-cover pseudoconfigurations and linear-programming pseudoconfigurations is also proved. While the LP receiver is generally more complex than the corresponding SP receiver, the LP receiver and its associated pseudoconfiguration structure provide an analytic tool for the analysis of SP receivers. As an example application, we show how the LP design technique may be applied to the problem of joint equalization and decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797568","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797568.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-programming receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797568/","displayDocTitle":"Linear-programming receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797568/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-programming receivers","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069707S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797569,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Raginsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Raginsky","id":"37321469500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797569","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Minimax techniques","Gaussian noise","Mutual information","Mean square error methods","Ellipsoids","Transmitters","Upper bound","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","minimax techniques","parameter estimation","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information capacity","Gaussian channels","small peak power constraints","symmetric equiprobable signaling","average-power capacity","minimum mean square error","minimax estimation","bounded parameter","white Gaussian noise","water- filling policy","nonlinear minimax risks","linear minimax risks"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with information capacities of Gaussian channels under small (but nonvanishing) peak power constraints. We prove that, when the peak amplitude is below 1.05, the capacity of the scalar Gaussian channel is achieved by symmetric equiprobable signaling and is equal to at least 80% of the corresponding average-power capacity. The proof uses the identity of Guo, Shamai and Verdu that relates mutual information and minimum mean square error in Gaussian channels, together with several results on the minimax estimation of a bounded parameter in white Gaussian noise. We also give upper and lower bounds on peak-power capacities of vector Gaussian channels whose inputs are constrained to lie in suitably small ellipsoids and show that we can achieve at least 80% of the average-power capacity by having the transmitters use symmetric equiprobable signaling at amplitudes determined from the usual water-filling policy. The 80% figure comes from an upper bound on the ratio of the nonlinear and the linear minimax risks of estimating a bounded parameter in white Gaussian noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the information capacity of Gaussian channels under small peak power constraints","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797569","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797569.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the information capacity of Gaussian channels under small peak power constraints","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797569/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479769","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the information capacity of Gaussian channels under small peak power constraints","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075563S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797572,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407590900"},{"name":"Jeffrey G.

First, the achievable ergodic rates are derived for both single-user and multi-user MIMO systems with different CSIT assumptions, which shows that single-user MIMO is robust to imperfect CSIT while multiuser MIMO loses spatial multiplexing gain in proportion to delay and inverse with channel quantization codebook size. A single-user/multiuser mode switching rule is then proposed based on the average SNR, the amount of delay, and the quantization codebook size. The operating regions for single-user and multiuser modes are determined, which can be used to select the preferred mode. It is shown that the multiuser mode should not be activated when the delay is large or the codebook size is small.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797572","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797572.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-user MIMO vs. Multiuser MIMO in the broadcast channel with CSIT constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797572/","displayDocTitle":"Single-user MIMO vs. Multiuser MIMO in the broadcast channel with CSIT constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501074","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797572/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-user MIMO vs. Multiuser MIMO in the broadcast channel with CSIT constraints","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096905S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4797579,"authors":[{"name":"Ilan Lobel","affiliation":["Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Lobel","id":"37573404000"},{"name":"Asuman Ozdaglar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Ozdaglar","id":"37300992700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797579","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Cost function","Wireless sensor networks","Stochastic processes","Computer networks","Network servers","Optimization methods","Operations research","Network topology","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","gradient methods","multi-agent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed subgradient methods","random networks","convex functions","time-varying network topology","stochastic process","link failures","convergence rate estimates"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of cooperatively minimizing the sum of convex functions, where the functions represent local objective functions of the agents. We assume that each agent has information about his local function, and communicate with the other agents over a time-varying network topology. For this problem, we propose a distributed subgradient method that uses averaging algorithms for locally sharing information among the agents. In contrast to previous works that make worst-case assumptions about the connectivity of the agents (such as bounded communication intervals between nodes), we assume that links fail according to a given stochastic process. Under the assumption that the link failures are independent and identically distributed over time (possibly correlated across links), we provide convergence results and convergence rate estimates for our subgradient algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797579","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797579.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797579","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","startPage":"353","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis of distributed subgradient methods over random networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Convergence analysis of distributed subgradient methods over random networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797579/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10479771","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence analysis of distributed subgradient methods over random networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09179S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4797580,"authors":[{"name":"Usman A.

First, for a single node, we obtain policies that are throughput optimal, i.e., the data queue stays stable for the largest possible data rate. Next we obtain energy management policies which minimize the mean delay in the queue. We also compare performance of several easily implementable sub-optimal policies. A greedy policy is identified which, in low SNR regime, is throughput optimal and also minimizes mean delay.

Increasing the cell level is easy; however, reducing a cell level forces all the other cells in the same block to be erased. This erasing operation is undesirable and therefore has to be used as infrequently as possible. We consider the problem of designing codes for this purpose, where k bits are stored using a block of n cells with q levels each. The goal is to maximize the number of bit writes before an erase operation is required. We present an efficient construction of codes that can store an arbitrary number of bits. Our construction can be viewed as an extension to multiple dimensions of the earlier work of Jiang and Bruck, where single-dimensional codes that can store only 2 bits were proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4797584/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501084","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional flash codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional flash codes","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120047S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4797595,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Mohajer","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Soheil","lastName":"Mohajer","id":"37296692200"},{"name":"Suhas N.

We examine this in the context of a deterministic wireless interaction model, which eliminates the channel noise and focuses on the signal interactions. Using this model, we show that almost all the known schemes such as interference suppression, interference alignment and interference separation are necessary for relay-interference networks. In addition, we discover a new interference management technique, which we call interference neutralization, which allows for over-the-air interference removal, without the transmitters having complete access the interfering signals. We show that interference separation, suppression, and neutralization arise in a fundamental manner, since we show complete characterizations for special configurations of the relay-interference network.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797595","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797595.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","startPage":"467","endPage":"474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission techniques for relay-interference networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission techniques for relay-interference networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797595/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501095","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission techniques for relay-interference networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056608S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4797596,"authors":[{"name":"Kery Hardwick","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kery","lastName":"Hardwick","id":"38192199400"},{"name":"Dennis Goeckel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Goeckel","id":"37271275100"},{"name":"Don Towsley","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Towsley","id":"37272331500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797596","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797596","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Wireless networks","Throughput","Brain modeling","Interference","US Government","Coherence","Computer science","Mobile ad hoc networks","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed beamforming modeling","wireless ad hoc networks","node random locations","random beam pattern","oft-used pie-wedge approximation","directed antenna beam","side lobe interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797596","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797596.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling distributed beamforming in wireless networks","abstract":"Distributed beamforming in wireless ad hoc networks has the promise of greatly improving network throughput. However, unlike traditional beamforming from a fixed array, the random locations of the nodes collaborating to form the array lead to a random beam pattern. In particular, the position and size of side lobes can vary greatly and have a significant impact on the concurrent transmissions that are the source of much of the throughput gain realized from distributed beamforming. Here, we present a simple model that captures this randomness and then use the model to consider the average throughput of a large ad hoc wireless networks. Numerical results are compared to those obtained if one employs the oft-used pie-wedge approximation for a directed antenna beam, and the difference is shown to be significant in regions where the side lobe interference is non-negligible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797596/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10501096","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797596/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling distributed beamforming in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling distributed beamforming in wireless networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075351S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797603,"authors":[{"name":"Ivana Maric","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Maric","id":"37273637600"},{"name":"Nan Liu","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37278122800"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797603","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Cognitive radio","Upper bound","Interference cancellation","Wireless networks","Noise cancellation","Radio spectrum management","Technology management","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cognitive radio","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Gel'fand-Pinsker encoding","interferer codebook","signal structure","random variations","source-destination channel","randomly generated codebook","superposition structure","interferer message","cognitive encoder","noisy channel"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by cognitive radio applications, we consider mitigating the effect of interference by exploiting known properties about its signal structure. Specifically, we analyze communication between a source and destination with an interferer that induces random variations in the source-destination channel. The interferer transmits a sequence chosen uniformly from a randomly generated codebook, which has an i.i.d. structure, or a superposition structure. It is assumed that both the encoder and decoder know the interferer's codebook. We first provide a definition of capacity for these settings. When the encoder knows the interferer's message noncausally, it can use Gel'fand-Pinsker (GP) encoding to precode against interference. Alternatively, it can encode by taking into account that the interference is a codeword, to enable the decoder to decode both messages. It is demonstrated by an example that the latter can outperform GP encoding. Two upper bounds to the performance of this channel are then presented. Next, a more realistic scenario is considered in which the interference is learned at the cognitive encoder causally through a noisy channel. It is shown that for the case of i.i.d. generated interference, this information has no value. In contrast, when the interference is a codeword from an i.i.d. generated codebook, this fact can be exploited to obtain higher rates between the cognitive pair.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797603","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797603.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"530","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding against an interferer's codebook","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Encoding against an interferer's codebook","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4797603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501103","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797603/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding against an interferer's codebook","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062767S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4797604,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Sridharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37705263600"},{"name":"Amin Jafarian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jafarian","id":"37402238700"},{"name":"Sriram Vishwanath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Vishwanath","id":"37283401100"},{"name":"Syed A.

This is accomplished by exchanging interference prices, each of which represents the marginal cost of interference to a particular user.

When each receiver has side information correlated with its own desired source, it is shown that source-channel code separation is optimal. When each receiver has side information correlated with the interfering source, sufficient conditions for reliable transmission are provided based on a joint source-channel coding scheme using the superposition encoding and partial decoding idea of Han and Kobayashi. When the receiver side information is a deterministic function of the interfering source, source-channel code separation is again shown to be optimal.

Although finding the sparse solutions in general may be computationally difficult, starting with the seminal work of [2], it has been shown that linear programming techniques, obtained from an l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm relaxation of the original non-convex problem, can provably find the unknown vector in certain instances. In particular, using a certain restricted isometry property, [2] shows that for measurement matrices chosen from a random Gaussian ensemble, l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization can find the correct solution with overwhelming probability even when the support size of the unknown vector is proportional to its dimension. The paper [1] uses results on neighborly polytopes from [6] to give a ldquosharprdquo bound on what this proportionality should be in the Gaussian measurement ensemble. In this paper we shall focus on finding sharp bounds on the recovery of ldquoapproximately sparserdquo signals (also possibly under noisy measurements). While the restricted isometry property can be used to study the recovery of approximately sparse signals (and also in the presence of noisy measurements), the obtained bounds can be quite loose. On the other hand, the neighborly polytopes technique which yields sharp bounds for ideally sparse signals cannot be generalized to approximately sparse signals. In this paper, starting from a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving a certain signal recovery accuracy, using high-dimensional geometry, we give a unified null-space Grassmannian angle-based analytical framework for compressive sensing. This new framework gives sharp quantitative tradeoffs between the signal sparsity and the recovery accuracy of the l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n optimization for approximately sparse signals. As it will turn out, the neighborly polytopes result of [1] for ideally sparse signals can be viewed as a special case of ours. Our result concerns fundamental properties of linear subspaces and so may be of independent mathematical interest.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing over the Grassmann manifold: A unified analytical framework","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797608","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797608.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing over the Grassmann manifold: A unified analytical framework","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797608/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501108","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing over the Grassmann manifold: A unified analytical framework","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079659S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4797610,"authors":[{"name":"Waheed U.

Training-based schemes, which involve probing of the channel with known signaling waveforms and processing of the corresponding channel output to estimate the channel parameters, are commonly employed to learn the channel response in practice. Conventional training-based methods, often comprising of linear least squares channel estimators, are known to be optimal under the assumption of rich multipath channels. Numerous measurement campaigns have shown, however, that physical multipath channels tend to exhibit a sparse structure at high signal space dimension (time-bandwidth product), and can be characterized with significantly fewer parameters compared to the maximum number dictated by the delay-Doppler spread of the channel. In this paper, it is established that traditional training-based channel learning techniques are ill-suited to fully exploiting the inherent low-dimensionality of sparse channels. In contrast, key ideas from the emerging theory of compressed sensing are leveraged to propose sparse channel learning methods for both single-carrier and multicarrier probing waveforms that employ reconstruction algorithms based on convex/linear programming. In particular, it is shown that the performance of the proposed schemes come within a logarithmic factor of that of an ideal channel estimator, leading to significant reductions in the training energy and the loss in spectral efficiency associated with conventional training-based methods.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797610","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797610.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning sparse doubly-selective channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797610/","displayDocTitle":"Learning sparse doubly-selective channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501110","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797610/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning sparse doubly-selective channels","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119313S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797611,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Tandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Tandra","id":"37392117800"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797611","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search problems","Channel coding","Particle separators","Machine learning","Design for experiments","Probability distribution","Sampling methods","Feedback","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","fading","Gaussian processes","noise","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR walls","macroscale features","signal to noise ratio","Gaussian mixture","noise-calibration based detection algorithm","arbitrarily-varying finite-tap fading processes","capacity-delay tradeoff"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797611","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797611","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","abstract":"We consider the problem of robustly detecting the presence/absence of signals in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environments. Our previous results have shown the existence of thresholds called SNR walls, below which robust detection becomes impossible due to uncertainties in the environment. These thresholds were shown to exist for many signals used in practice. This paper introduces the idea of macroscale features and shows that they can be used to construct signals that evade SNR walls. In particular, we examine a Gaussian mixture example and a noise-calibration based detection algorithm to show that this signal can be robustly detected in the presence of arbitrarily-varying noise and arbitrarily-varying finite-tap fading processes. Finally, we argue that there is tension between the primary user's capacity and the sensing delay experienced by the secondary users. We call this the capacity-delay tradeoff. We derive the capacity-delay tradeoff for the Gaussian example.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","startPage":"583","endPage":"590","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797611.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming SNR walls through macroscale features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4797611/","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming SNR walls through macroscale features","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501111","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming SNR walls through macroscale features","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092061S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797612,"authors":[{"name":"Bobak Nazer","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Bobak","lastName":"Nazer","id":"38482531700"},{"name":"Alexandros G.

The results are useful in determining fundamental rate delay tradeoffs when transmitting temporally ordered content over multipath routed networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity region of the permutation channel","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797619","startPage":"646","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797619.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity region of the permutation channel","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797619/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501119","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity region of the permutation channel","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063064S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797626,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohu Shang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Shang","id":"37408900800"},{"name":"Biao Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, USA"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280633800"},{"name":"Gerhard Kramer","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, USA"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37275136700"},{"name":"H.

We assume transmitted signals at a node to its neighbor nodes are orthogonal, e.g., using frequency division multiplexing (FDM). We first consider a simple discrete memoryless network where there is a source, a destination, and two parallel relays between them. We characterize its capacity under a certain restriction on encoders. For general discrete memoryless relay networks with orthogonal components, we find the capacity if the channels are linear finite field channels with random erasures. For general Gaussian relay networks with orthogonal components, we show an achievable rate based on a sequence of nested lattice codes. The cut-set upper bound and our achievability are within a constant number of bits that depends only on the network topology but not on the channel gains. This is similar to the recent result by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse who showed such an approximate characterization of the capacity of general Gaussian relay networks.

In particular, a transmitter does not transmit any energy during an ldquooffrdquo mini-slot in its signature sequence. The received signal can be viewed as the outcome of a sequence of tests over the mini-slots, where the outcome of a test is positive if there is energy at the corresponding mini-slot from at least one neighbor, and negative if none of the neighboring nodes transmits energy during the mini-slot. The neighbor discovery problem is thus equivalent to a classical group testing problem. Two practical and scalable detection algorithms are developed from the group testing viewpoint. Unlike some previous neighbor discovery schemes using coherent multiuser detection, which are difficult to implement due to lack of training, the proposed scheme requires only non-coherent energy detection. The proposed algorithms are shown to achieve faster and more reliable discovery than existing random access schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797638.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"797","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbor discovery in wireless ad hoc networks based on group testing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","Centralized control","Transmitters","Ad hoc networks","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Switches","System testing","Optimal control","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","multiuser detection","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neighbor discovery","wireless ad hoc networks","group testing","ALOHA-type random access discovery schemes","on-off signatures","signature sequence","scalable detection algorithms","coherent multiuser detection","noncoherent energy detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neighbor discovery in wireless ad hoc networks based on group testing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501138","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbor discovery in wireless ad hoc networks based on group testing","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05779S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4797639,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The geometric approach utilizes geometric properties of the measurement matrix Phi. A notable example is the Restricted Isometry Property, which states that the mapping Phi preserves the Euclidean norm of sparse signals; it is known that random dense matrices satisfy this constraint with high probability. On the other hand, the combinatorial approach utilizes sparse matrices, interpreted as adjacency matrices of sparse (possibly random) graphs, and uses combinatorial techniques to recover an approximation to the signal. In this paper we present a unification of these two approaches. To this end, we extend the notion of Restricted Isometry Property from the Euclidean lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n norm to the Manhattan lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm.

At the same time we show that the new property suffices to guarantee correctness of both geometric and combinatorial recovery algorithms. As a result, we obtain new measurement matrix constructions and algorithms for signal recovery which, compared to previous algorithms, are superior in either the number of measurements or computational efficiency of decoders.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797639.pdf","startPage":"798","endPage":"805","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining geometry and combinatorics: A unified approach to sparse signal recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Combinatorial mathematics","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Image coding","Signal processing algorithms","Computer networks","Signal processing","Cameras","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","matrix algebra","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse signal recovery","combinatorics","geometry","restricted isometry property","Euclidean norm","sparse signals","combinatorial approach","signal approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Combining geometry and combinatorics: A unified approach to sparse signal recovery","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797639/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501139","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining geometry and combinatorics: A unified approach to sparse signal recovery","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103662S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4797640,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel J.

We require that messages from any subset of transmitters are secure even if other transmitters are compromised, i.e., messages from the compromised transmitter are revealed to the unintended receivers.

This model is motivated by wireless communications, where individual secure messages are broadcast over open media and can be received by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured by equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general (non-degraded) broadcast channel with confidential messages. We present an inner bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. The inner bound coding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the Gelfand-Pinsker bining. This scheme matches the Marton's inner bound on the broadcast channel without confidentiality constraint. We further study the situation where the channels are degraded. For the degraded broadcast channel with confidential messages, we present the secrecy capacity region. Our achievable coding scheme is based on Cover's superposition scheme and random binning. We refer to this scheme as secret superposition scheme. In this scheme, we show that randomization in the first layer increases the secrecy rate of the second layer. This capacity region matches the capacity region of the degraded broadcast channel without security constraint. It also matches the secrecy capacity for the conventional wire-tap channel. Our converse proof is based on a combination of the converse proof of the conventional degraded broadcast channel and Csiszar lemma.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797644","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797644.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure broadcasting : The secrecy rate region","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797644/","displayDocTitle":"Secure broadcasting : The secrecy rate region","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501144","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797644/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure broadcasting : The secrecy rate region","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063653S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797645,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shahmohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shahmohammadi","id":"37885879500"},{"name":"Hesham El Gamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37273282800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797645","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Decoding","Error probability","Application software","Fasteners","Protection","Data security","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital fingerprinting","tree search","tree codes","collusion attacks","software fingerprinting","minimum distance decoding","random coding argument"]}],"abstract":"In this work we consider the application of tree codes in designing digital fingerprinting schemes under collusion attacks. Our setting is the Boneh-Shaw's marking assumption which is a common model for software fingerprinting. In a previous work we studied minimum distance decoding for the problem and proposed a low complexity scheme capable of catching one pirate for a coalition size equal to 2. The previous contribution was not extendable to the case of larger coalition sizes. In this paper we extend our work on designing low complexity fingerprinting schemes to the general case of arbitrary coalition sizes. Moreover, here we aim to identify the whole coalition instead of just one colluder. In order to do so we assume that the attack is fair the validity of which hinges on the fact that all pirates in the coalition will want to take the same chance of being caught as others. The decoding is done by searching for a coalition which satisfies the marking assumption sequentially on the Cartesian product of the tree code with its replicas. Using a random coding argument, the decoder's cutoff rate is characterized for a general t. Average error probability for the random ensemble is also proved to be vanishing for rates less than the cutoff rate. Finally, using an expurgation argument we establish the existence of a tree code with vanishing error probability and finite complexity.

It is assumed that the relays have statistical channel state information (CSI) of the local source-relay channels, while the destination has full instantaneous CSI of channels. It turns out that, combined with power allocation in the relays, AF DSTC results in a new opportunistic relaying scheme, in which the best relay is selected to retransmit the source's signal. Furthermore, we have derived the optimum power allocation between two cooperative transmission phases by maximizing the average received SNR at the destination. Next, assuming M-PSK and M-QAM modulations, we analyze the performance of cooperative diversity wireless networks using AF opportunistic relaying. We first derive the probability density function (pdf) and the moment generating function (MGF) of the received SNR at the destination. Then, the MGF is used to determine the symbol error rate in Rayleigh fading channels.

The first strategy uses repetition coding, where the same symbol is duplicated over the two transmit antennas in two consecutive time slots. The second strategy employs the Alamouti scheme, while the third strategy is based on spatial multiplexing. A mean squared error distortion measure is assumed. Since this distortion results, at the receiver, in a continuous random variable, both its expected value and statistical distribution are used for evaluating the performance of each strategy. It is shown that the spatial multiplexing strategy achieves the lowest expected distortion and also that the utilization of the Alamouti strategy brings only a slight decrease in performance, but has the advantage of a lower realization complexity. Considering the statistical distributions of distortion, it is observed that increasing the signal-to-noise ratio results in higher probabilities of achieving the expected distortion and to less variable values of distortion. Due to the characteristics of the respective distributions of distortion, both Alamouti and spatial multiplexing strategies are capable of achieving low distortion with high probability while, at the same probability, the repetition strategy achieves significantly higher distortion.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797669","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797669.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source information transmission over MIMO systems with transmitter side information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Source information transmission over MIMO systems with transmitter side information","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797669/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501169","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797669/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source information transmission over MIMO systems with transmitter side information","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101927S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797670,"authors":[{"name":"Ersen Ekrem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ersen","lastName":"Ekrem","id":"37395816700"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797670","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Educational institutions","Zinc","Gaussian channels","Interference channels","Decoding","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access wiretap channel","secrecy capacity region","weak eavesdropper","channel capacity","Gaussian MAC-WT"]}],"abstract":"We develop an outer bound for the secrecy capacity region of a class of multiple access wiretap channels (MAC-WT).

For this case, we derive an explicit upper-bound on the asymptotic decoding error probability as a function of the number of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797678","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797678.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic distance and convergence analysis of braided protograph convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic distance and convergence analysis of braided protograph convolutional codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797678/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501178","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797678/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic distance and convergence analysis of braided protograph convolutional codes","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100382S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4797682,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In this paper, cooperation is investigated as an approach to overcome this problem and improve the performance of secure communications. In particular, a decode-and-forward (DF) based cooperative protocol is considered, and the objective is to design the system for secrecy capacity maximization or transmit power minimization. System design for the DF-based cooperative protocol is first studied by assuming the availability of global channel state information (CSI). For the case of one eavesdropper, an iterative scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal solution for the problem of transmit power minimization. For the case of multiple eavesdroppers, the problem of secrecy capacity maximization or transmit power minimization is in general intractable. Suboptimal system design is proposed by adding an additional constraint, i.e., the complete nulling of signals at all eavesdroppers, which yields simple closed-form solutions for the aforementioned two problems. Then, the impact of imperfect CSI of eavesdroppers on system design is studied, in which the ergodic secrecy capacity is of interest.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797687","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797687.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure wireless communications via cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure wireless communications via cooperation","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797687/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501187","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure wireless communications via cooperation","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079116S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797702,"authors":[{"name":"Shashi Kiran Chilappagari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shashi Kiran","lastName":"Chilappagari","id":"37321432800"},{"name":"Dung Viet Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dung Viet","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37405920000"},{"name":"Bane Vasic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bane","lastName":"Vasic","id":"38188106300"},{"name":"Michael W.

Projects are underway in the IEEE 802.1 standards body, especially in the Data Center Bridging Task Group, to define new switched Ethernet functions for data center use. One such project is IEEE 802.1Qau, the Congestion Notification project, whose aim is to develop an Ethernet congestion control algorithm for hardware implementation. A major contribution of this paper is the description and analysis of the congestion control algorithm - QCN, for Quantized Congestion Notification- which has been developed for this purpose. A second contribution of the paper is an articulation of the Averaging Principle: a simple method for making congestion control loops stable in the face of increasing lags. This contrasts with two well-known methods of stabilizing control loops as lags increase; namely, (i) increasing the order of the system by sensing and feeding back higher-order derivatives of the state, and (ii) determining the lag and then choosing appropriate loop gains. Both methods have been applied in the congestion control literature to obtain stable algorithms for high bandwidth-delay product paths in the Internet. However, these methods are either undesirable or infeasible in the Ethernet context. The Averaging Principle provides a simple alternative, one which we are able to theoretically characterize.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797706","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797706.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797706","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data center transport mechanisms: Congestion control theory and IEEE standardization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Data center transport mechanisms: Congestion control theory and IEEE standardization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797706/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501206","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data center transport mechanisms: Congestion control theory and IEEE standardization","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033692S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"69","articleId":"4797706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4797715,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We propose a low-complexity algorithm to design the beamforming codebook of time n + 1 by rotating a root codebook by a unitary matrix that is determined by the selected beamforming codeword at time n. We investigate the design of root codebook according to different optimization criteria, aiming to either maximize the average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), maximize the capacity, or to minimize the bit-error-rate (BER). Performance evaluations for uncoded systems reveal that the SNR based design does not perform as well as the codebook designed for the identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) channel (i.e. a high SNR problem). We show that the BER based design alleviates the high SNR problem effectively and leads to good performance in both coded and uncoded systems. Compared to systems that do not take channel temporal correlation into account, the proposed design achieves about 2 dB performance gain at a low feedback rate of only 3 bits per channel use.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10501217","htmlLink":"/document/4797717/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming codebook design for temporally correlated fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming codebook design for temporally correlated fading channels","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051923S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4797718,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Najafi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Najafi","id":"37862207100"},{"name":"Mohammad Erfan Danesh Jafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad Erfan Danesh","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37842646400"},{"name":"Mohamed Oussama Damen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed Oussama","lastName":"Damen","id":"37266498600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797718","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Fading","Detectors","Lattices","Rayleigh channels","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood estimation","Antennas and propagation","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","computational complexity","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive soft-output detection","MIMO systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","wireless fading channels","list sphere decoder algorithm","Rayleigh MIMO channel","temporal correlation","complexity reduction","log-likelihood ratio","channel information","performance-complexity tradeoff","maximum likelihood point estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate soft-output detection for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems over wireless fading channels.

The signals are first converted into point processes, where each event of a point process corresponds to a burst of activity of the corresponding signal in an appropriate feature space. The similarity of signals is then computed by adaptively aligning the events from the different point processes. If the point processes are similar, clusters containing one point from each time series will naturally appear. Synchrony is then measured as a function of the size of the clusters and the distance between points within one cluster. The alignment of events is defined in a natural statistical model; the optimal clustering is obtained through maximum a posteriori inference and can be cast as a combinatorial optimization problem. As the dimension and the number of signals increase, so does the complexity of the inference task. In particular, the inference task corresponds to: a) a dynamic program when comparing two 1-dimensional signals; b) A maximum weighted matching on a bipartite graph when comparing two d-dimensional signals; c) A NP-hard integer program that can be reduced to N-dimensional matching when comparing N ges 2 signals We show the applicability of the method by predicting the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from EEG signals.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797722","startPage":"1381","endPage":"1388","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797722.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing brain signals by combinatorial optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing brain signals by combinatorial optimization","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797722/","accessionNumber":"10501222","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797722/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing brain signals by combinatorial optimization","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095529S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797723,"authors":[{"name":"Hilary Finucane","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Finucane","id":"37398663400"},{"name":"Zhenming Liu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37400636400"},{"name":"Michael Mitzenmacher","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mitzenmacher","id":"37266774000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797723","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"Floating codes are codes designed to store multiple values in a write asymmetric memory, with applications to flash memory.

A code here corresponds to mapping from cell states to variable values, and a transition function that gives how to rewrite cell states when a variable is changed. Previous work has focused on the developing codes that maximize the worst-case number of variable changes, or equivalently cell rewrites, that can be experienced before resetting. In this paper, we introduce the problem of maximizing the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">expected</i>\n number of variable changes before resetting, given an underlying Markov chain that models variable changes.

In this model, two sources simultaneously transmit to two relays (in the first hop), which then simultaneously transmit to two destinations (in the second hop). While the transmission during the first hop is essentially the transmission over a classical interference channel, the transmission in the second hop enjoys an interesting advantage. Specifically, as a byproduct of the Han-Kobayashi transmission scheme applied to the first hop, each of the relays (in the second hop) has access to some of the data that is intended to the other destination, in addition to its own data. As recently observed by Simeone et al., this opens the door to cooperation between the relays. In this paper, we observe that the cooperation can take the form of distributed MIMO broadcast, thus greatly enhancing its effectiveness at high SNR. However, since each relay is only aware of part of the data beyond its own, full cooperation is not possible. We propose several approaches that combine MIMO broadcast strategies (including ldquodirty paperrdquo) with standard non-cooperative strategies for the interference channel. Numerical results are provided, which indicate that our approaches provide substantial benefits at high SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797731/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10501231","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797731/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rate-achievability strategies for two-hop interference flows","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-achievability strategies for two-hop interference flows","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069282S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4797741,"authors":[{"name":"Libin Jiang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Libin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37398011400"},{"name":"Jean Walrand","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Walrand","id":"37266402700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797741","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":141,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Throughput","Wireless networks","Scheduling algorithm","Interference","Spread spectrum communication","Protocols","Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","distributed algorithms","protocols","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","scheduling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed CSMA algorithm","throughput maximization","utility maximization","multihop wireless networks","distributed scheduling algorithms","complex interference constraints","maximal-weight scheduling","distributed greedy protocol","IEEE 802.11","adaptive CSMA scheduling algorithm","end-to-end flow control","carrier sense multiple access","wireless local area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer optimization","joint scheduling and congestion control","maximal throughput","CSMA"]}],"abstract":"In multi-hop wireless networks, designing distributed scheduling algorithms to achieve the maximal throughput is a challenging problem because of the complex interference constraints among different links. Traditional maximal-weight (MW) scheduling, although throughput-optimal, is difficult to implement in distributed networks; whereas a distributed greedy protocol similar to IEEE 802.11 does not guarantee the maximal throughput. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive CSMA scheduling algorithm that can achieve the maximal throughput distributedly under some assumptions. Major advantages of the algorithm include: (1) It applies to a very general interference model; (2) It is simple, distributed and asynchronous. Furthermore, we combine the algorithm with end-to-end flow control to achieve the optimal utility and fairness of competing flows. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulations. Finally, we consider some implementation issues in the setting of 802.11 networks.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797741","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797741.pdf","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed CSMA algorithm for throughput and utility maximization in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797741/","displayDocTitle":"A distributed CSMA algorithm for throughput and utility maximization in wireless networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501241","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797741/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed CSMA algorithm for throughput and utility maximization in wireless networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108471S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786970","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4797526","articleId":"4797741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797744,"authors":[{"name":"Toby Berger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Toby","lastName":"Berger","id":"37275040200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2925-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2926-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4797744","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Source coding","Decoding","Block codes","Distortion measurement","Channel coding","Broadcasting","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hamming codes","rate distortion theory","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiterminal rate-distortion theory","multiterminal lossy source coding","admissible rate region","optimum encoders","optimum decoders","Hamming distortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797744","abstract":"The problem of determining the region of achievable rates and distortions for multiterminal lossy source coding remains unsolved.

This lower bound shows that unstructured codes achieve within one bit of the optimal sum rate at any distortion level.

We analyze the achievable rate region and show that the scheme achieves to within 3 bits the cut-set bound for all values of channel gains.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797751","publicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786970/4797526/04797751.pdf","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate capacity of the two-way relay channel: A deterministic approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797751/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate capacity of the two-way relay channel: A deterministic approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10501251","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797751/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate capacity of the two-way relay channel: A deterministic approach","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035993S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2008","isNumber":"4797526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786970","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4797751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4797789,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Rutzinger","affiliation":["Centre of Natural Hazard Management and the Institute of Geography, University of Innsbruck, Austria","International Institute for Geo-information sciences and Earth Observation, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/4897342/4797789/4797789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Rutzinger received the Ph.D. degree in natural sciences from the Leopold-Franzens-University, Innsbruck, Austria, in 2008.","Until he finished his doctoral thesis, he was a junior researcher at the alpS Centre for Natural Hazard Management, Innsbruck.

Whereas pixel-based evaluation gives estimates of the area that is correctly classified, the results are distorted by errors at the building outlines. These distortions are potentially in an order of 30%. Object-based evaluation techniques are less affected by such errors. However, the performance metrics thus delivered are sometimes considered to be less objective, because the definition of a ldquocorrect detectionrdquo is not unique. Based on a critical review of existing performance metrics, selected methods for the evaluation of building detection results are presented. These methods are used to evaluate the results of two different building detection algorithms in two test sites. A comparison of the evaluation techniques shows that they highlight different properties of the building detection results. As a consequence, a comprehensive evaluation strategy involving quality metrics derived by different methods is proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2012488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/4897342/04797789.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2012488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Evaluation Techniques for Building Extraction From Airborne Laser Scanning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Evaluation Techniques for Building Extraction From Airborne Laser Scanning","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4797789/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10601486","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Evaluation Techniques for Building Extraction From Airborne Laser Scanning","sourcePdf":"jstars-rutzinger-2012488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120022S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"4897342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"4897342","articleId":"4797789","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4797806,"authors":[{"name":"A.

During the occurrence of lightning or switching surges, a voltage level above the equipment insulation level can be reached. An arrester, properly working, is able to limit this voltage level avoiding damages to the protected equipment. A defective arrester may not be able to provide the proper protection level in substations, exposing the equipment and personnel to damage. Monitoring of surge arresters is usually conducted by means of current measurement or thermal images acquisition. But, among power companies, there is no model procedure for the monitoring conduction and analysis of the obtained results. Besides that, when some abnormality is detected, the arrester is replaced by a new one and no further study is conducted to evaluate what kind of problem happened to it. This work proposes a method for analysis of ZnO arresters by the study of failures and usage of artificial neural networks-ANN. The ANN is able to analyze the thermal profile, detect and classify patterns that could be undetected by a visual analysis. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2013402","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2013402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/04797810.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks Used for ZnO Arresters Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797810/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks Used for ZnO Arresters Diagnosis","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4797810/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10731599","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks Used for ZnO Arresters Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-ewanderleyneto-2013402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070536S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"4797810","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4797815,"authors":[{"name":"Songhwai Oh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Merced, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/4799326/4797815/4797815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Songhwai Oh (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), in 1995, 2003, and 2006, respectively.","He is an Assistant Professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the School of Engineering, University of California, Merced.

For general multitarget tracking problems, in which unknown numbers of targets appear and disappear at random times, we present a multi-scan MCMCDA algorithm that approximates the optimal Bayesian filter.

In this paper, we present a new particle filter tracking algorithm that incorporates the multiple-model (MM) paradigm and the technique of state partitioning with parallel filters. Traditionally, most tracking algorithms assume that a target operates according to a single dynamic model. However, the single-model assumption can cause the tracker to become unstable, particularly when the target has complex motions and when the camera has abrupt ego-motions. In the new tracking algorithm, a target was assumed to operate according to one dynamic model from a finite set of models. The switching process from one model to another was governed by a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">jump</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Markov</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">process</i>\n. Based on the improved MM particle filter framework, we offer a new design strategy that adopts the state-partitioning technique and a bank of parallel extended Kalman filters to construct a better proposal distribution to achieve further estimation accuracy. We have conducted extensive testing for the proposed tracking algorithm, and key outcomes were given in the results section. It has been demonstrated by the experiments that this approach gave significantly improved estimations, enabling the new particle filter to effectively track human subjects.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2014511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2014511","startPage":"1797","endPage":"1809","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4812252/04797826.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Object-Tracking Algorithm Based on Multiple-Model Particle Filtering With State Partitioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Object-Tracking Algorithm Based on Multiple-Model Particle Filtering With State Partitioning","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797826/","accessionNumber":"10560738","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797826/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Object-Tracking Algorithm Based on Multiple-Model Particle Filtering With State Partitioning","sourcePdf":"tim-zhai-2014511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110214S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4812252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4812252","articleId":"4797826","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4797832,"authors":[{"name":"Mariaana Savia","affiliation":["Department of Automation Science and Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5204513/4797832/4797832-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mariaana Savia (S'99\u2013M'08) received the M.Sc. degree in control engineering from Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland.","She is currently a Research Scientist in the Department of Automation Science and Engineering, Tampere University of Technology.

Strategies are divided according to how they take account of adhesion forces. Micromanipulation refers to handling of objects that have dimensions below hundreds of micrometers with handling accuracy down to submicrometers. The line between micro- and nanomanipulation is not definite but typically the object size in nanomanipulation is considered to reach from atomic and molecular scale to hundreds of nanometers. In contact micromanipulation, the tool physically touches the manipulated objects during handling. Scaling-effect-induced adhesion forces severely complicate micromanipulation when compared to conventional macromanipulation. At microscale, the most important adhesive forces are van der Waals force, electrostatic force, and capillary force. Adhesion forces are also the reason behind the fairly low level of automation in microassembly systems. Improved success rate of micromanipulation operations requires that the special features of microscale phenomena be taken into consideration.","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5204513/04797832.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"514","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2008.2011986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2008.2011986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact Micromanipulation\u2014Survey of Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Contact Micromanipulation\u2014Survey of Strategies","htmlLink":"/document/4797832/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10828559","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact Micromanipulation\u2014Survey of Strategies","sourcePdf":"tmech-savia-2011986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150047S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5204513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5204513","articleId":"4797832","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4797836,"authors":[{"name":"Jarno Vanne","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4982901/4797836/4797836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jarno Vanne (M'02) received the M.S. degree in information technology from Tampere University of Technology (TUT), Tampere, Finland, in 2002.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree as a research scientist in the DACI research group, the Department of Computer Systems, TUT.

Contemporary motion estimation architectures are either too rigid for multiple BMAs or the flexibility in them is implemented at the cost of reduced performance. The proposed architecture overcomes both of these limitations. The configurability of the proposed architecture is based on a new BMA framework that can be adjusted to support the desired set of BMAs. The chosen framework configuration is implemented by an intelligent control logic which is integrated to an efficient parallel memory system and distortion computation unit. The flexibility of the framework is demonstrated by mapping five different BMAs (BBGDS, DS, CDS, HEXBS, and TSS) to the architecture. The total execution time of the mapped BMAs is shown to be almost directly proportional to the number of tested checking points in the search area, so the architecture is very tolerant of different BMA-specific search strategies and search patterns. In addition, a run-time switching between supported BMAs can be done without performance compromises. With a 0.13-mum CMOS technology, the proposed architecture configured for HEXBS, BBGDS, and TSS requires only 14.2 kgates and 2.5 KB of memory at 200 MHz operating frequency. A performance comparison to the reference programmable architectures reveals that only the proposed implementation is able to process real-time (30 fps) fixed block-size motion estimation (1 reference frame) at full HDTV resolution (1920 times1080).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4982901/04797836.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2014012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2014012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982901","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Configurable Motion Estimation Architecture for Block-Matching Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Computer architecture","CMOS technology","Costs","Intelligent control","Logic","Concurrent computing","Testing","Runtime","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","motion estimation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","block-matching algorithms","framework configuration","intelligent control logic","CMOS technology","block based gradient descent search","cross diamond search","hexagon based search","three step search","size 0.13 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-matching algorithms (BMAs)","BMA framework","configurable architecture","motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Configurable Motion Estimation Architecture for Block-Matching Algorithms","volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4797836/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10667264","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Configurable Motion Estimation Architecture for Block-Matching Algorithms","sourcePdf":"19tcsvt04-jvanne-2014012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116047S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4982901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4982901","articleId":"4797836","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4797837,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Farrugia","affiliation":["France Telecom Division, Orange Laboratories, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Farrugia","id":"37692078600"},{"name":"Franck Mamalet","affiliation":["France Telecom Division, Orange Laboratories, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Mamalet","id":"37331859300"},{"name":"S\u00c9bastien Roux","affiliation":["France Telecom Division, Orange Laboratories, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"S\u00c9bastien","lastName":"Roux","id":"37529520800"},{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["LE2I Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538164900"},{"name":"Michel Paindavoine","affiliation":["LE2I Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Paindavoine","id":"37273346400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4797837","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1559},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Face detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Parallel architectures","Hardware","Pipelines","Convolution","Multilayer perceptrons","Design methodology","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","field programmable gate arrays","multilayer perceptrons","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face detection","parallel optimized architecture","FPGA","convolutional face finder","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded","face detection","FPGA","high level synthesis","parallel architecture","realtime"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a parallel architecture for fast and robust face detection implemented on FPGA hardware.

The power consumption is first translated to the encoding computation costs measured by the number of scaled computation units consumed by basic operations. The solved problem is then specified to be the allocation and utilization of the computational resources. A computation allocation model (CAM) with virtual computation buffers is proposed to optimally allocate the computational resources to each video frame. In particular, the proposed CAM and the traditional hypothetical reference decoder model have the same temporal phase in operations. Further, to fully utilize the allocated computational resources, complexity-configurable motion estimation (CAME) and complexity-configurable mode decision (CAMD) algorithms are proposed for H.264 video encoding. In particular, the CAME is performed to select the path of motion search at the frame level, and the CAMD is performed to select the order of mode search at the macroblock level.

In contrast to previous approaches that minimize the power consumption by adjusting the backlight intensity frame by frame to reach a specified image quality, the proposed method optimizes the image quality for a given backlight intensity. Image is enhanced by performing brightness compensation and local contrast enhancement. For brightness compensation, global image statistics and backlight level are considered to maintain the overall brightness of the image. For contrast enhancement, the local contrast property of human visual system (HVS) is exploited to enhance the local image details. In addition, a brightness prediction scheme is proposed to speed up the algorithm for display of video sequences. Experimental results are presented to show the performance of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2014022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4982901/04797843.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2014022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Enhancement for Backlight-Scaled TFT-LCD Displays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797843/","displayDocTitle":"Image Enhancement for Backlight-Scaled TFT-LCD Displays","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10667262","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4797843/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Enhancement for Backlight-Scaled TFT-LCD Displays","sourcePdf":"19tcsvt04-hchen-2014022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060663S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4982901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4982901","articleId":"4797843","onlineDate":"04 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4797849,"authors":[{"name":"Vin\u00cdcius F.

Using Finsler's lemma, a new design condition assuring the existence of such a controller is formulated as a parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI) with extra matrix variables and parameters in the unit simplex. Algebraic properties of the system parameters and recent results of positive polynomials are used to construct LMI relaxations that, differently from most relaxations in the literature, provide certificates of convergence to solve the control design problem. Due to the degrees of freedom obtained with the extra variables, the conditions presented in this paper are an improvement over earlier results based only on Polya's theorem and can be viewed as an alternative to the use of techniques based on the relaxation of quadratic forms.

High energy portions of the speech spectrum have higher signal-to-noise ratios than the low energy portions. As a result, these regions are more robust to noise. Since the speech signal is known to be very robust to noise, it is expected that the high energy regions of the speech spectrum carry the majority of the linguistic information. This letter tries to derive a frequency warping function directly from the speech signal by sampling the frequency axis nonuniformly with the high energy regions sampled more densely than the low energy regions. To achieve this, an ensemble average short-time power spectrum is computed from a large speech corpus. The speech-signal-based frequency warping is obtained by considering equal area portions of the log spectrum. The proposed frequency warping is shown to be similar to the frequency scales obtained through psycho-acoustic experiments, namely the mel and bark scales. The warping is then used in filterbank design for automatic speech recognition experiments. The results of these experiments show that cepstral features based on the proposed warping achieve performance under clean conditions comparable to that of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, while outperforming them under noisy conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797893/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10570235","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4797893/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speech-Signal-Based Frequency Warping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech-Signal-Based Frequency Warping","sourcePdf":"lsp-wojcicki-2014096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057509S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4781949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4781949","articleId":"4797893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4797906,"authors":[{"name":"Silvio Ziegler","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4787210/4797906/4797906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Silvio Ziegler received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland, in 2006.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that reduces the task of hard-field imaging from incomplete data to a sinogram recovery problem. The algorithm utilises a novel angular interpolation scheme, employing the sinusoidal Hough transform, to identify sinusoidal traces in the sinogram and estimate missing sinogram samples along such traces. Together with the detailed theory behind the algorithm, we present its performance with experimental data obtained from a photonic guided path tomography system. The targeted subject function is the induced deformation in the quasi-planar surface of a flexible ~1 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n sensor, fixed to an underlying soft-foam mat.

The optimization problem formulation, which inherently takes into account every array element pattern as well as all interelement couplings, is based on matrix-valued functions which are computed from the generalized-scattering-matrix characterization of an array and spherical mode expansions of its radiated field. It allows the maximization of the directive gain subject to a maximum sidelobe level, a maximum crosspolar level and a minimum aperture illumination efficiency, the setting of null-pointing directions and the dynamic range control. To solve the resulting non-linear optimization problem, we have developed a primal-dual interior point method specifically adapted to the presented formulation, which makes use of novel filtering techniques. Numerical examples of arrays of microstrip patches and dielectric resonator antennas covering a wide variety of requirements on these parameters are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2009727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2009727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Analogously to the original one, it predicts attenuation through a cellular representation of precipitation, but, in addition, is able to discriminate between stratiform and convective rain by means of an embedded algorithm. Accordingly, two separate physical rain heights, derived from the ERA-15 database, are used to calculate stratiform and convective rain attenuation and, when considering stratiform precipitation, the melting layer contribution to attenuation is added. Eventually, the predicted cumulative distribution function (CDF) of excess attenuation is the combination of the contributions due to stratiform and convective precipitation types. Some input parameters of the prediction model, such as those defining the melting layer process or the rain plateau embedding rain cells, can be modified in order to account for the local meteorological characteristics. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2009698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2009698","startPage":"196","endPage":"204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4797948/04797980.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Prediction Model of Rain Attenuation That Separately Accounts for Stratiform and Convective Rain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Prediction Model of Rain Attenuation That Separately Accounts for Stratiform and Convective Rain","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","volume":"57","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10503004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797980/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Prediction Model of Rain Attenuation That Separately Accounts for Stratiform and Convective Rain","sourcePdf":"57tap01-lluini-2009698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060592S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"4797948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"78","articleId":"4797980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4797981,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias John","affiliation":["Centre of Telecommunications Value-chain Research, School of Electronic and Communications Engineering, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"John","id":"37295122600"},{"name":"Max J.

The validity of the proposed model is confirmed by comparing of the FDTD results and the measured data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Equivalent Feed Model for the FDTD Analysis of Antennas Driven Through a Ground Plane by Coaxial Lines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2008.2009650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4797948/04797987.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2008.2009650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4797948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4797987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4797987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Equivalent Feed Model for the FDTD Analysis of Antennas Driven Through a Ground Plane by Coaxial Lines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4797987/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10503011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Equivalent Feed Model for the FDTD Analysis of Antennas Driven Through a Ground Plane by Coaxial Lines","sourcePdf":"57tap01-skim-2009650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065506S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4797948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4797948","articleId":"4797987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4797988,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Maruyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4797948/4797988/4797988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takashi Maruyama (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronics engineering from Shizuoka University, Shizuoka, Japan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively.","In 2003, he joined NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Yokosuka, Japan.

Given the ratio of serial and parallel portions in an application and the number of processors, we derive optimal frequencies allocated to the serial and parallel regions in an application to either minimize the total energy consumption or minimize the energy-delay product. The impact of static power is revealed by considering the ratio between static and dynamic power and quantifying the advantages of adding to the architecture capability to turn off individual processors and save static energy. We further determine the conditions under which one can obtain both energy and speed improvement, as well as the amount of improvement. While the formulas we obtain use simplifying assumptions, they provide valuable theoretical insights into energy-aware processor resource management. Our results form a basis for several interesting research directions in the area of energy-aware multicore processor architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798160/","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4798160/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11162423","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Interplay of Parallelization, Program Performance, and Energy Consumption","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Interplay of Parallelization, Program Performance, and Energy Consumption","sourcePdf":"ttd2010030342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125354S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5400984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5400984","articleId":"4798160","onlineDate":"06 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798164,"authors":[{"name":"Huanhuan Chen","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications (CERCIA), University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4976428/4798164/4798164-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huanhuan Chen received the BSc degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2004, and PhD degree, sponsored by Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award (DHPA), in computer science at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, in 2008.

The existing ensemble learning algorithms often generate unnecessarily large ensembles, which consume extra computational resource and may degrade the generalization performance. Ensemble pruning algorithms aim to find a good subset of ensemble members to constitute a small ensemble, which saves the computational resource and performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. This paper introduces a probabilistic ensemble pruning algorithm by choosing a set of ldquosparserdquo combination weights, most of which are zeros, to prune the ensemble. In order to obtain the set of sparse combination weights and satisfy the nonnegative constraint of the combination weights, a left-truncated, nonnegative, Gaussian prior is adopted over every combination weight. Expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior estimation of the weight vector. The leave-one-out (LOO) error can be obtained as a by-product in the training of EP without extra computation and is a good indication for the generalization error. Therefore, the LOO error is used together with the Bayesian evidence for model selection in this algorithm. An empirical study on several regression and classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm utilizes far less component learners but performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. Our results are very competitive compared with other ensemble pruning algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.62","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4976428/04798164.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Ensemble Pruning by Expectation Propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Ensemble Pruning by Expectation Propagation","volume":"21","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666302","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798164/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Ensemble Pruning by Expectation Propagation","sourcePdf":"ttk2009070999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104732S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4976428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4976428","articleId":"4798164","onlineDate":"06 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":4798172,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Kumar Meher","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4957542/4798172/4798172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pramod Kumar Meher (SM'03) received the first class degrees of B.Sc.

Using the proposed algorithm for unit degree reduction and optimization of implementation of the logic functions in the processing elements (PEs), we have derived an efficient bit-parallel systolic design for finite field multiplier which involves nearly two-thirds of the area-complexity of the existing design having the same time-complexity.

Similarly, the proposed digit-serial/parallel designs involve significantly less area, and less area-time complexities compared with the existing designs of the same digit-size. By parallel modular reduction through multiple degrees followed by appropriate logic-level sub-expression sharing; a hardware-efficient regular and modular form of a balanced-tree bit-parallel non-systolic multiplier is also derived.

The quality of demosaicked images is degraded due to the sensor noise introduced during the image acquisition process. The conventional solution to combating CFA sensor noise is demosaicking first, followed by a separate denoising processing. This strategy will generate many noise-caused color artifacts in the demosaicking process, which are hard to remove in the denoising process. Few denoising schemes that work directly on the CFA images have been presented because of the difficulties arisen from the red, green and blue interlaced mosaic pattern, yet a well designed ldquodenoising first and demosaicking laterrdquo scheme can have advantages such as less noise-caused color artifacts and cost-effective implementation. This paper presents a principle component analysis (PCA) based spatially-adaptive denoising algorithm, which works directly on the CFA data using a supporting window to analyze the local image statistics. By exploiting the spatial and spectral correlations existed in the CFA image, the proposed method can effectively suppress noise while preserving color edges and details. Experiments using both simulated and real CFA images indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms many existing approaches, including those sophisticated demosaicking and denoising schemes, in terms of both objective measurement and visual evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2011384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4799361/04798177.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2011384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCA-Based Spatially Adaptive Denoising of CFA Images for Single-Sensor Digital Cameras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"PCA-Based Spatially Adaptive Denoising of CFA Images for Single-Sensor Digital Cameras","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10505431","pubMedId":"19273050","htmlLink":"/document/4798177/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCA-Based Spatially Adaptive Denoising of CFA Images for Single-Sensor Digital Cameras","sourcePdf":"18tip04-lzhang-2011384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120153S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4799361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4799361","articleId":"4798177","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798178,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Jiang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37395108600"},{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281224100"},{"name":"Aggelos K.

It provides fast 3D deterministic predictions in urban radio configurations and over large areas. The various techniques to make it suitable to the network planning and optimization of large wireless networks are described. The resulting radio propagation maps exhibit seamless coverage between the various environments (dense urban, urban, and suburban). The model efficiently addresses all types of outdoor transmitter configurations (macrocells, minicells, microcells, and picocells) and all types of receiver locations (at ground level, over the rooftop, and at high building floors). It predicts the field strength as well as the dominant specular contributions of the impulse responses to build ray spectra (including delays and angles). Thus, the model may also be used to estimate the performances of new radio systems [diversity and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)]. The narrowband power prediction of the model is evaluated by comparison with microcell measurements. The evaluation stresses the advantage of 3D modeling compared with the vertical-plane approach or 2D ray tracing. Finally, the ability of the model to simulate radio wideband characteristics in a complex environment is demonstrated by comparing delay-spread estimates to measurements collected from a high-macrocell transmitter in a hilly city and to arrival angles collected in a suburban macrocell area.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2016973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04798203.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2016973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","startPage":"3112","endPage":"3123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Urban EM Wave Propagation Model for Radio Network Planning and Optimization Over Large Areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Urban EM Wave Propagation Model for Radio Network Planning and Optimization Over Large Areas","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829124","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Urban EM Wave Propagation Model for Radio Network Planning and Optimization Over Large Areas","sourcePdf":"tvt-lostanlen-2016973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062981S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4798203","onlineDate":"06 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4798204,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Wu","affiliation":["Group of Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407319000"},{"name":"Xu Zhu","affiliation":["Group of Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37278845900"},{"name":"Asoke K.

The proposed scheme exploits the advantages of both V-BLAST and Alamouti space-time block coding (STBC). In particular, it adaptively only transmits space-time-coded copies to remediable collisions. The coded replicas contain the same information as the packets involved in collisions and are immediately sent after a colliding slot. Combining the packets received in two consecutive slots, the Alamouti STBC scheme can be reconstructed to linearly resolve the collision without sacrificing the space-time diversity gain. An embedded Markov chain is developed to derive performance metrics with respect to throughput, diversity gain, delay, and stability. The tradeoff among those metrics is investigated. The results demonstrate that ASTDSA significantly outperforms the existing schemes, and simulations are used to validate the analytical model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5204505/04798205.pdf","startPage":"3271","endPage":"3282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2016975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2016975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Space\u2013Time Diversity Slotted ALOHA Over - MIMO Multiaccess Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","MIMO","Diversity methods","Analytical models","Protocols","Block codes","Image reconstruction","Measurement","Throughput","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","adaptive codes","diversity reception","Markov processes","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive space-time diversity slotted ALOHA","MIMO multiaccess channels","random-access protocol","multiple-input-multiple-output channels","embedded Markov chain","collision diversity","coded replicas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive space\u2013time diversity","multiple input\u2013multiple output (MIMO)","slotted ALOHA","stability","throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Space\u2013Time Diversity Slotted ALOHA Over <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $2\\times m$</tex></formula> MIMO Multiaccess Channels","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4798205/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829131","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Space\u2013Time Diversity Slotted ALOHA Over <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\"> $2\\times m$</tex></formula> MIMO Multiaccess Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2016975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084838S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4798205","onlineDate":"06 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4798206,"authors":[{"name":"Lucia C.

The energy-band model has accounted for the screening of the gate field by the electrons or holes, which has been largely missed in the literature. Although SB-MOSFETs are essentially ambipolar devices, we show that the separate modeling of electron and hole currents is simple yet accurately predicts the final ambipolar current. Thinner oxide thickness is confirmed to be beneficial to SB-MOSFETs for both ON - and OFF-state currents. However, smaller nanowire radius (or thinner body thickness) is found to be only beneficial to SB-MOSFETs with high SB heights (SBHs) despite the OFF-state current being reduced significantly. For SB-MOSFETs with low SBHs, the tunneling-current-density enhancement due to a smaller radius is not able to compensate the reduction in the contact size, which leads to a degradation of the ldquoONrdquo current. The drift current in the channel is shown to be negligible in SB-MOSFETs, and the tunneling/thermionic current through the SB represents the main current-limiting mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May

Techniques have been proposed to prefetch such accesses. Unfortunately, many LDS prefetching techniques 1) generate a large number of useless prefetches, thereby degrading performance and bandwidth efficiency, 2) require significant hardware or storage cost, or 3) when employed together with stream-based prefetchers, cause significant resource contention in the memory system. As a result, existing processors do not employ LDS prefetchers even though they commonly employ stream-based prefetchers. This paper proposes a low-cost hardware/software cooperative technique that enables bandwidth-efficient prefetching of linked data structures. Our solution has two new components: 1) a compiler-guided prefetch filtering mechanism that informs the hardware about which pointer addresses to prefetch, 2) a coordinated prefetcher throttling mechanism that uses run-time feedback to manage the interference between multiple prefetchers (LDS and stream-based) in a hybrid prefetching system. Evaluations show that the proposed solution improves average performance by 22.5% while decreasing memory bandwidth consumption by 25% over a baseline system that employs an effective stream prefetcher on a set of memory- and pointer-intensive applications. We compare our proposal to three different LDS/correlation prefetching techniques and find that it provides significantly better performance on both single-core and multi-core systems, while requiring less hardware cost.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798232","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","startPage":"7","endPage":"17","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for bandwidth-efficient prefetching of linked data structures in hybrid prefetching systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798232/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10502327","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for bandwidth-efficient prefetching of linked data structures in hybrid prefetching systems","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"004 Session1_1_ebrahimi_hpca09_97_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078367S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798233,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Janapa Reddi","affiliation":["Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay Janapa","lastName":"Reddi","id":"37293801200"},{"name":"Meeta S.

The possibility of wide fluctuations in supply voltage means that timing margins throughout the processor must be set pessimistically to protect against worst-case droops and surges. While sensor-based reactive schemes have been proposed to deal with voltage noise, inherent sensor delays limit their effectiveness. Instead, this paper describes a voltage emergency predictor that learns the signatures of voltage emergencies (the combinations of control flow and microarchitectural events leading up to them) and uses these signatures to prevent recurrence of the corresponding emergencies. In simulations of a representative superscalar microprocessor in which fluctuations beyond 4% of nominal voltage are treated as emergencies (an aggressive configuration), these signatures can pinpoint the likelihood of an emergency some 16 cycles ahead of time with 90% accuracy. This lead time allows machines to operate with much tighter voltage margins (4% instead of 13%) and up to 13.5% higher performance, which closely approaches the 14.2% performance improvement possible with an ideal oracle-based predictor.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798233","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage emergency prediction: Using signatures to reduce operating margins","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voltage emergency prediction: Using signatures to reduce operating margins","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502328","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage emergency prediction: Using signatures to reduce operating margins","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"005 Session1_2_vijay_181_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143726S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798234,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Xu","id":"37403519000"},{"name":"Yu Du","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Du","id":"37403374300"},{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Bo Zhao","id":"37404433400"},{"name":"Xiuyi Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiuyi Zhou","id":"37696501800"},{"name":"Youtao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Youtao Zhang","id":"38183309800"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280196900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798234","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":659},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Network-on-a-chip","Network topology","Delay","Wires","Fabrics","Stacking","Mesh generation","Throughput","Mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","logic design","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-diameter 3D interconnection network design","low radix router","3D network-on-chip topology design","3D stacking technology","one-hop vertical communication design","small-to-medium sized clique network","chip multiprocessor","sub-micron technology"]}],"abstract":"Interconnection plays an important role in performance and power of CMP designs using deep sub-micron technology. The network-on-chip (NoCs) has been proposed as a scalable and high-bandwidth fabric for interconnect design. The advent of the 3D technology has provided further opportunity to reduce on-chip communication delay. However, the design of the 3D NoC topologies has important distinctions from 2D NoCs or off-chip interconnection networks. First, current 3D stacking technology allows only vertical inter-layer links. Hence, there cannot be direct connections between arbitrary nodes in different layers - the vertical connection topology are essentially fixed. Second, the 3D NoC is highly constrained by the complexity and power of routers and links. Hence, low-radix routers are preferred over high-radix routers for lower power and better heat dissipation. This implies long network latency due to high hop counts in network paths. In this paper, we design a low-diameter 3D network using low-radix routers. Our topology leverages long wires to connect remote intra-layer nodes. We take advantage of the start-of-the-art one-hop vertical communication design and utilize lateral long wires to shorten network paths. Effectively, we implement a small-to-medium sized clique network in different layers of a 3D chip. The resulting topology generates a diameter of 3-hop only network, using routers of the same radix as 3D mesh routers. The proposed network shows up to 29% of network latency reduction, up to 10% throughput improvement, and up to 24% energy reduction, when compared to a 3D mesh network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-radix and low-diameter 3D interconnection network design","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798234","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798234.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A low-radix and low-diameter 3D interconnection network design","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502329","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-radix and low-diameter 3D interconnection network design","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"006 Session1_3_Yi-HPCA09-LowRadix-IEEE.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049809S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4798234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798236,"authors":[{"name":"Moinuddin K.

This prevents such CMPs from sharing cache capacity in response to the requirement of individual cores. Capacity sharing can be provided in private caches by spilling a line evicted from one cache to another cache. However, naively allowing all caches to spill evicted lines to other caches have limited performance benefit as such spilling does not take into account which cores benefit from extra capacity and which cores can provide extra capacity. This paper proposes dynamic spill-receive (DSR) for efficient capacity sharing. In a DSR architecture, each cache uses set dueling to learn whether it should act as a ldquospiller cacherdquo or ldquoreceiver cacherdquo for best overall performance. We evaluate DSR for a quad-core system with 1MB private caches using 495 multi-programmed workloads. DSR improves average throughput by 18% (weighted-speedup by 13% and harmonic-mean fairness metric by 36%) compared to no spilling. DSR requires a total storage overhead of less than two bytes per core, does not require any changes to the existing cache structure, and is scalable to a large number of cores (16 in our evaluation). Furthermore, we propose a simple extension of DSR that provides quality of service (QoS) by guaranteeing that the worst-case performance of each application remains similar to that with no spilling, while still providing an average throughput improvement of 17.5%.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798236","startPage":"45","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798236.pdf","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798236/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Spill-Receive for robust high-performance caching in CMPs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798236/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502330","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Spill-Receive for robust high-performance caching in CMPs","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"008 Session2A_1_moinqureshi hpca09_18_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027659S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798239,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas F.

Unfortunately, these prefetchers require large on-chip meta-data storage, making previously-proposed designs impractical. Hence, to improve practicality, researchers have sought ways to enable timely prefetch while locating meta-data entirely off-chip. Unfortunately, current solutions for off-chip meta-data increase memory traffic by over a factor of three. We observe three requirements to store meta-data off chip: minimal off-chip lookup latency, bandwidth-efficient meta-data updates, and off-chip lookup amortized over many prefetches. In this work, we show: (1) minimal off-chip meta-data lookup latency can be achieved through a hardware-managed main memory hash table, (2) bandwidth-efficient updates can be performed through probabilistic sampling of meta-data updates, and (3) off-chip lookup costs can be amortized by organizing meta-data to allow a single lookup to yield long prefetch sequences. Using these techniques, we develop sampled temporal memory streaming (STMS), a practical address-correlating prefetcher that keeps predictor meta-data in main memory while achieving 90% of the performance potential of idealized on-chip meta-data storage.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798239.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical off-chip meta-data for temporal memory streaming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Delay","Table lookup","Bandwidth","Costs","Hardware","Throughput","Web server","Sampling methods","Organizing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","storage management","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-chip meta-data storage","prefetching","minimal off-chip lookup latency","bandwidth-efficient meta-data update","hardware-managed main memory hash table","probabilistic sampling","off-chip lookup cost","sampled temporal memory streaming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Practical off-chip meta-data for temporal memory streaming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502333","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical off-chip meta-data for temporal memory streaming","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"011 Session2A_4_Practical_Off_chip_Meta_data.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072798S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4798241,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Fu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37532127600"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37539272900"},{"name":"Jose A.

Prior studies have shown that chip operating frequency and leakage power can have large variations due to fluctuations in transistor gate length and sub-threshold voltage. In this work, we study the impact of process variation on microarchitecture soft error robustness, an increasing reliability design challenge in the billion-transistor chip era. We explore two techniques that can effectively mitigate the effect of design parameter variation while significantly enhancing microarchitecture soft error reliability. Our first technique is entry-based. It tolerates the deleterious impact of variable latency techniques on soft error reliability by reducing the quantity and residency cycle of vulnerable bits in the microarchitecture structure at a fine granularity. Our second technique is structure-based. It applies body biasing schemes to dynamically adapt transistor sub-threshold voltage (and hence device-level soft error robustness) to the program reliability characteristics at a coarse granularity. We also combine the two techniques which further produces improved results. Compared to existing process variation tolerant schemes, our proposed techniques achieve optimal trade-offs between reliability, performance, and power.

There is much ongoing research on efficient fault tolerance mechanisms across all levels of the system stack, from the device level to the system level. High-level fault tolerance solutions, such as at the microarchitecture and system levels, are commonly evaluated using statistical fault injections with microarchitecture-level fault models. Since hardware faults actually manifest at a much lower level, it is unclear if such high level fault models are acceptably accurate. On the other hand, lower level models, such as at the gate level, may be more accurate, but their increased simulation times make it hard to track the system-level propagation of faults. Thus, an evaluation of high-level reliability solutions entails the classical tradeoff between speed and accuracy. This paper seeks to quantify and alleviate this tradeoff. We make the following contributions: (1) We introduce SWAT-Sim, a novel fault injection infrastructure that uses hierarchical simulation to study the system-level manifestations of permanent (and transient) gate-level faults. For our experiments, SWAT-Sim incurs a small average performance overhead of under 3x, for the components we simulate, when compared to pure microarchitectural simulations. (2) We study system-level manifestations of faults injected under different microarchitecture-level and gate-level fault models and identify the reasons for the inability of microarchitecture-level faults to model gate-level faults in general. (3) Based on our analysis, we derive two probabilistic microarchitecture-level fault models to mimic gate-level stuck-at and delay faults. Our results show that these models are, in general, inaccurate as they do not capture the complex manifestation of gate-level faults. The inaccuracies in existing models and the lack of more accurate microarchitecture-level models motivate using infrastructures similar to SWAT-Sim to faithfully model the microarchitecture-level effects of gate-level faults.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798242","startPage":"105","endPage":"116","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798242.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate microarchitecture-level fault modeling for studying hardware faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microarchitecture","Hardware","Circuit faults","Fault tolerant systems","Analytical models","Redundancy","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Latches","Logic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault simulation","fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microarchitecture-level fault modeling","hardware faults","hardware reliability","SWAT-Sim","fault injection infrastructure","hierarchical simulation","system-level manifestation","permanent gate-level faults","transient gate-level faults","performance overhead","microarchitectural simulations","gate-level fault model","probabilistic microarchitecture-level fault model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accurate microarchitecture-level fault modeling for studying hardware faults","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798242/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502335","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate microarchitecture-level fault modeling for studying hardware faults","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"014 Session2B_2_hpca09-li-swatsim_40_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100383S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4798243,"authors":[{"name":"Vilas Sridharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"firstName":"Vilas","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37428556000"},{"name":"David R.

AVF captures both microarchitectural and architectural fault masking effects; therefore, AVF measurements cannot generate insight into the vulnerability of software independent of hardware. To evaluate the behavior of software in the presence of hardware faults, we must isolate the software-dependent (architecture-level masking) portion of AVF from the hardware-dependent (microarchitecture-level masking) portion, providing a quantitative basis to make reliability decisions about software independent of hardware. In this work, we demonstrate that the new program vulnerability factor (PVF) metric provides such a basis: PVF captures the architecture-level fault masking inherent in a program, allowing software designers to make quantitative statements about a program's tolerance to soft errors. PVF can also explain the AVF behavior of a program when executed on hardware; PVF captures the workload-driven changes in AVF for all structures. Finally, we demonstrate two practical uses for PVF: choosing algorithms and compiler optimizations to reduce a program's failure rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eliminating microarchitectural dependency from Architectural Vulnerability","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798243","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798243.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Eliminating microarchitectural dependency from Architectural Vulnerability","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798243/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502336","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminating microarchitectural dependency from Architectural Vulnerability","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"015 Session2B_3_hpca09_sridharan_final_42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046587S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798250,"authors":[{"name":"George Michelogiannakis","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Michelogiannakis","id":"37540629500"},{"name":"James Balfour","affiliation":["Computer Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Balfour","id":"37689648800"},{"name":"William J.

With this approach, the channels themselves act as distributed FIFO buffers. Without VCBs, and hence virtual channels (VCs), deadlock prevention is achieved by duplicating physical channels. We develop a channel occupancy detector to apply universal globally adaptive load-balancing (UGAL) routing to load balance traffic in networks using EBs. Using EBs results in up to 8% (12% for low-swing channels) improvement in peak throughput per unit power compared to a VC flow-control network. These gains allow for a wider network datapath to be used to offset the removal of VCBs and increase throughput for a fixed power budget. EB networks have identical zero-load latency to VC networks operating under the same frequency. The microarchitecture of an EB router is considerably simpler than a VC router because allocators and credits are not required. For 5 times 5 mesh routers, this results in an 18% improvement in the cycle time.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798250","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798250.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic-buffer flow control for on-chip networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798250/","displayDocTitle":"Elastic-buffer flow control for on-chip networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502340","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798250/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic-buffer flow control for on-chip networks","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"022 Session3A_1_EBFlow_68_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046579S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798251,"authors":[{"name":"Boris Grot","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Grot","id":"37669789100"},{"name":"Joel Hestness","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Hestness","id":"38480735700"},{"name":"Stephen W.

Scalability of on-chip interconnect topologies is critical to meeting these demands. In this work, we seek to develop a better understanding of how network topologies scale with regard to cost, performance, and energy considering the advantages and limitations afforded on a die. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a new topology, called Multidrop Express Channels (MECS), that uses a one-to-many communication model enabling a high degree of connectivity in a bandwidth-efficient manner. In a 64-terminal network, MECS enjoys a 9% latency advantage over other topologies at low network loads, which extends to over 20% in a 256-terminal network. Second, we demonstrate that partitioning the available wires among multiple networks and channels enables new opportunities for trading-off performance, area, and energy-efficiency that depend on the partitioning scheme. Third, we introduce Generalized Express Cubes - a framework for expressing the space of on-chip interconnects - and demonstrate how existing and proposed topologies can be mapped to it.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798251","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798251.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Express Cube Topologies for on-Chip Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798251/","displayDocTitle":"Express Cube Topologies for on-Chip Interconnects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502341","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798251/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Express Cube Topologies for on-Chip Interconnects","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"023 Session3A_2_mecs_140_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072429S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798252,"authors":[{"name":"Reetuparna Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Reetuparna","lastName":"Das","id":"37534767200"},{"name":"Soumya Eachempati","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Soumya","lastName":"Eachempati","id":"37394238600"},{"name":"Asit K.

Both these parameters can also be optimized by application induced communication locality since applications mapped on a large CMP system will benefit from clustered communication, where data is placed in cache banks closer to the cores accessing it. Thus, in this paper, we design a hierarchical network topology that takes advantage of such communication locality. The two-tier hierarchical topology consists of local networks that are connected via a global network. The local network is a simple, high-bandwidth, low-power shared bus fabric, and the global network is a low-radix mesh. The key insight that enables the hybrid topology is that most communication in CMP applications can be limited to the local network, and thus, using a fast, low-power bus to handle local communication will improve both packet latency and power-efficiency. The proposed hierarchical topology provides up to 63% reduction in energy-delay-product over mesh, 47% over flattened butterfly, and 33% with respect to concentrated mesh across network sizes with uniform and non-uniform synthetic traffic. For real parallel workloads, the hybrid topology provides up to 14% improvement in system performance (IPC) and in terms of energy-delay-product, improvements of 70%, 22%, 30% over the mesh, flattened butterfly, and concentrated mesh, respectively, for a 32-way CMP. Although the hybrid topology scales in a power- and bandwidth-efficient manner with network size, while keeping the average packet latency low in comparison to high radix topologies, it has lower throughput due to high concentration. To improve the throughput of the hybrid topology, we propose a novel router micro-architecture, called XShare, which exploits data value locality and bimodal traffic characteristics of CMP applications to transfer multiple small flits over a single channel. This helps in enhancing the network throughput by 35%, providing a latency reduction of 14% with synthetic traffic, and improving IPC on an average 4% with application workloads.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798252","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","startPage":"175","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of a hierarchical on-chip interconnect for next-generation CMPs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a hierarchical on-chip interconnect for next-generation CMPs","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798252/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502342","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798252/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a hierarchical on-chip interconnect for next-generation CMPs","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"024 Session3A_3_hpca-topology-Das-#190_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050512S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798256,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Greskamp","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science and of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Greskamp","id":"37298399500"},{"name":"Lu Wan","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science and of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wan","id":"37574324700"},{"name":"Ulya R.

However, such timing speculation (TS) proposals are limited in that they assume traditional design methodologies that are suboptimal under TS. In this paper, we present a new approach where the processor itself is designed from the ground up for TS. The idea is to identify and optimize the most frequently-exercised critical paths in the design, at the expense of the majority of the static critical paths, which are allowed to suffer timing errors. Our approach and design optimization algorithm are called BlueShift. We also introduce two techniques that, when applied under BlueShift, improve processor performance: on-demand selective biasing (OSB) and path constraint tuning (PCT). Our evaluation with modules from the OpenSPARC T1 processor shows that, compared to conventional TS, BlueShift with OSB speeds up applications by an average of 8% while increasing the processor power by an average of 12%. Moreover, compared to a high-performance TS design, BlueShift with PCT speeds up applications by an average of 6% with an average processor power overhead of 23% . providing a way to speed up logic modules that is orthogonal to voltage scaling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blueshift: Designing processors for timing speculation from the ground up.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798256","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798256.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blueshift: Designing processors for timing speculation from the ground up.","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798256/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502345","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blueshift: Designing processors for timing speculation from the ground up.","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"028 Session3B_3_blueshift-distilled_223_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143506S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798259,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyu Sun","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404006100"},{"name":"Xiangyu Dong","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Dong","id":"37407343000"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37538123800"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798259","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":264,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2847},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Stacking","Delay","Magnetic cores","Magnetic tunneling","Sun","Computational modeling","Fabrication","Degradation","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","memory architecture","MRAM devices","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D stacked MRAM L2 cache","conventional chip multiprocessors","magnetic random access memory","3D heterogeneous integrations","SRAM counterparts","read-preemptive write buffer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798259","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798259.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798259","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel architecture of the 3D stacked MRAM L2 cache for CMPs","abstract":"Magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is a promising memory technology, which has fast read access, high density, and non-volatility. Using 3D heterogeneous integrations, it becomes feasible and cost-efficient to stack MRAM atop conventional chip multiprocessors (CMPs). However, one disadvantage of MRAM is its long write latency and its high write energy. In this paper, we first stack MRAM-based L2 caches directly atop CMPs and compare it against SRAM counterparts in terms of performance and energy. We observe that the direct MRAM stacking might harm the chip performance due to the aforementioned long write latency and high write energy. To solve this problem, we then propose two architectural techniques: read-preemptive write buffer and SRAM-MRAM hybrid L2 cache. The simulation result shows that our optimized MRAM L2 cache improves performance by 4.91% and reduces power by 73.5%compared to the conventional SRAM L2 cache with the similar area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798259/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502347","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798259/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel architecture of the 3D stacked MRAM L2 cache for CMPs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel architecture of the 3D stacked MRAM L2 cache for CMPs","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"031 Session4A_2_HPCA2009-MRAM_173_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151223S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4798261,"authors":[{"name":"Niti Madan","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Niti","lastName":"Madan","id":"37393716300"},{"name":"Li Zhao","affiliation":["System Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, India"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292355100"},{"name":"Naveen Muralimanohar","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Muralimanohar","id":"37391840200"},{"name":"Aniruddha Udipi","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Aniruddha","lastName":"Udipi","id":"37391839500"},{"name":"Rajeev Balasubramonian","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Balasubramonian","id":"37391836500"},{"name":"Ravishankar Iyer","affiliation":["System Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, India"],"firstName":"Ravishankar","lastName":"Iyer","id":"37273059400"},{"name":"Srihari Makineni","affiliation":["System Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, India"],"firstName":"Srihari","lastName":"Makineni","id":"37281654500"},{"name":"Donald Newell","affiliation":["System Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, India"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Newell","id":"37272506400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798261","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":557},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Network-on-a-chip","Delay","Network topology","Proposals","Technological innovation","Space technology","Stacking","Bandwidth","Chip scale packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","integrated circuit design","multiprocessing systems","network topology","network-on-chip","reconfigurable architectures","SRAM chips","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D stacked reconfigurable cache hierarchy","multicore processor","chip design","SRAM chip","DRAM chip","OS-based page coloring","horizontal communication","tree topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-core processors","cache and memory hierarchy","non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA)","page coloring","on-chip networks","SRAM/DRAM cache reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"Cache hierarchies in future many-core processors are expected to grow in size and contribute a large fraction of overall processor power and performance.

We then propose a heterogeneous reconfigurable cache design that takes advantage of the high density of DRAM and the superior power/delay characteristics of SRAM to efficiently meet the working set demands of each individual core. Finally, we analyze the communication patterns for such a processor and show that a tree topology is an ideal fit that significantly reduces the power and latency requirements of the on-chip network.

The key assets of customization are cost and power efficiency. The key limitation of customization is flexibility. However, we argue that there is no perfect balance between efficiency and flexibility, each system vendor may want to strike a different such balance. In this article, we present a method for achieving any desired balance between flexibility and efficiency by automatically combining any set of individual customization circuits into a larger compound circuit. This circuit is significantly more cost efficient than the simple union of all target circuits, and is configurable to behave as any of the target circuits, while avoiding the routing and configuration cost overhead of FPGAs. The more individual circuits are included, the larger the number of applications which can potentially benefit from this compound customization circuit, realizing flexibility at a minimal cost. Moreover, we observe that the compound circuit cost does not increase in proportion to the number of target applications, due to the wide range of common data-flow and control-flow patterns in programs. Currently, the target individual circuits correspond to loops, like most accelerators in embedded systems, but the aggregation method can accommodate circuits of any size. Using the UTDSP benchmarks and accelerators coupled with an embedded PowerPC405 processor, we show that this approach can yield an average performance improvement of 2.97, while the corresponding synthesized aggregate accelerator is 3 time smaller than the sum of individual accelerators for each target benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798263","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798263.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798263","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconciling specialization and flexibility through compound circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconciling specialization and flexibility through compound circuits","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10502350","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798263/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconciling specialization and flexibility through compound circuits","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"035 Session4B_1_HPCA09_yehia_Girbal_Berry.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060399S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798264,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

Designers must employ aggressive power-management techniques at run-time to keep a processor's ballooning power requirements under control. Effective power management benefits from knowledge of run-time microprocessor power consumption in both the core and individual microarchitectural structures, such as caches, queues, and execution units. Increasingly feasible per-structure power-control techniques, such as fine-grain clock gating, power gating, and dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS), become more effective from run-time estimates of per-structure power. However, run-time computation of per-structure power estimates based on utilization requires daunting numbers of input statistics, which makes per-structure monitoring of run-time power a challenging problem. To address the challenges of estimating per-structure power in hardware, we propose a new technique, called Common Activity-based Model for Power (CAMP), to estimate activity factors and power for microarchitectural structures. Despite using a relatively few input parameters-specifically nine-based on general microprocessor utilization statistics (e.g., IPC and load rate), our linear-regression-based model estimates activity and dynamic power for over 100 structures in an out-of-order x86 pipeline and core power with an average error of 8%. Because the computations utilize few inputs, CAMP is simple enough to implement in hardware, providing run-time structure and core power estimates for dynamic power management. Because the input statistics are generic in nature and the model remains accurate across incremental microarchitectural refinements, CAMP provides simple intuitive equations relating global microarchitectural statistics to structure activity and power. These equations provide a simple technique that can equate changes in one structure's activity to power variations in other structures across the pipeline.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAMP: A technique to estimate per-structure power at run-time using a few simple parameters","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798264","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798264.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"CAMP: A technique to estimate per-structure power at run-time using a few simple parameters","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798264/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAMP: A technique to estimate per-structure power at run-time using a few simple parameters","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"036 Session4B_2_PID786367_45_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061927S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798265,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Herbert","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Herbert","id":"37604302900"},{"name":"Diana Marculescu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Marculescu","id":"37273684500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798265","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":923},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic voltage scaling","Throughput","Hardware","Energy efficiency","Energy management","Manufacturing processes","Microprocessors","Frequency control","Aggregates","Fuses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multi-threading","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variation-aware dynamic voltage/frequency scaling","chip-multiprocessors","DVFS controllers","core-to-core variations"]}],"abstract":"Fine-grained dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) is an important tool in managing the balance between power and performance in chip-multiprocessors.

Two hardware DVFS control algorithms are considered and the gains enabled by incorporating variability-awareness are demonstrated on multithreaded commercial workloads.

In this paper, we propose a customized semi-programmable loop accelerator architecture that exploits the efficiency gains available through high levels of customization, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to execute multiple similar loops. A customized instance of the loop accelerator architecture is generated for a particular loop and then the data and control paths are proactively generalized in an efficient manner to increase flexibility. A compiler mapping phase is then able to map other loops onto the same hardware. The efficiency of the programmable accelerator is compared with non-programmable accelerators and with the OpenRISC 1200 general purpose processor. The programmable accelerator is able to achieve up to 34x better power efficiency and 30x better area efficiency than a simple general purpose processor, while trading off as little as 2x power and area efficiency to the non-programmable accelerator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798266.pdf","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798266","startPage":"313","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the computation gap between programmable processors and hardwired accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798266/","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the computation gap between programmable processors and hardwired accelerators","htmlLink":"/document/4798266/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10502353","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the computation gap between programmable processors and hardwired accelerators","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"038 Session4B_4_fank-hpca09_157_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092941S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798270,"authors":[{"name":"Xi E.

This paper proposes analytical models for predicting the cache contention and throughput of heavily multithreaded architectures such as Sun Microsystems' Niagara. First, it proposes a novel probabilistic model to accurately predict the number of extra cache misses due to cache contention for significantly larger numbers of threads than possible with prior analytical cache contention models. Then it presents a Markov chain model for analytically estimating the throughput of multicore, fine-grained multithreaded architectures. The Markov model uses the number of stalled threads as the states and calculates transition probabilities based upon the rates and latencies of events stalling a thread. By modeling the overlapping of the stalls among threads and taking account of cache contention our models accurately predict system throughput obtained from a cycle-accurate performance simulator with an average error of 7.9%. We also demonstrate the application of our model to a design problem-optimizing the design of fine-grained multithreaded chip multiprocessors for application-specific workloads-yielding the same result as detailed simulations 65 times faster. Moreover, this paper shows that our models accurately predict cache contention and throughput trends across varying workloads on real hardware-a Sun Fire T1000 server.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798270","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798270.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","startPage":"329","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A first-order fine-grained multithreaded throughput model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A first-order fine-grained multithreaded throughput model","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798270/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502354","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798270/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A first-order fine-grained multithreaded throughput model","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"042 Session5A_1_xichen hpca2009_152_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0843S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798273,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Abad","affiliation":["University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Abad","id":"38132331300"},{"name":"Valentin Puente","affiliation":["University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Puente","id":"37282495800"},{"name":"Jose-Angel Gregorio","affiliation":["University of Cantabria, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Angel","lastName":"Gregorio","id":"37282495000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798273","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Hardware","Telecommunication traffic","Unicast","Communication system traffic control","Bandwidth","Proposals","Network-on-a-chip","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully adaptive multicast routing","CMP interconnection networks","on-network hardware support","multidestination traffic","multiprocessor machines","bandwidth utilization","multidestination packets","chip multiprocessors","on-chip networks","multicast rotary router","on-network multicast support","adaptive tree","multicast traffic","on-network congestion control","network utilization"]}],"abstract":"On-network hardware support for multi-destination traffic is a desirable feature in most multiprocessor machines. Multicast hardware capabilities enable much more effective bandwidth utilization as multi-destination packets do not need to repeatedly use the same resources, as occurs when multicast traffic must be decomposed in unicast packets. Although Chip Multiprocessors are not an exception in this interest, up to date, few fitting proposals exist. The combination of the scarcity of available resources and the common idea that multicast support requires a substantial amount of extra resources is responsible for this situation. In this work, we propose a new approach suitable for on-chip networks capable of managing multi-destination traffic via hardware in an efficient way with negligible complexity. We introduce the Multicast Rotary Router (MRR), a router able to: (1) perform on-network multicast support with almost zero cost over the Rotary Router, (2) use a fully adaptive tree to distribute multicast traffic, (3) perform on-network congestion control extending network utilization range. The performance results, using a state-of-the-art full system simulation framework, show that it improves average full system performance of a CMP using a unicast Rotary Router in its interconnection network by 25%, and an input buffered router with multicast support by 20%.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798273","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798273.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRR: Enabling fully adaptive multicast routing for CMP interconnection networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798273/","displayDocTitle":"MRR: Enabling fully adaptive multicast routing for CMP interconnection networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502356","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798273/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRR: Enabling fully adaptive multicast routing for CMP interconnection networks","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"045 Session5B_1_abad_mrr_15_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12946S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4798274,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Matsutani","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Matsutani","id":"37545270100"},{"name":"Michihiro Koibuchi","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Michihiro","lastName":"Koibuchi","id":"37283850400"},{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideharu","lastName":"Amano","id":"37280731600"},{"name":"Tsutomu Yoshinaga","affiliation":["Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Yoshinaga","id":"37269812600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798274","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":571},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Switches","Prediction algorithms","Network-on-a-chip","Computer architecture","Packet switching","Communication switching","Routing","Hardware","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network routing","network-on-chip","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low latency network-on-chip router architecture","output channel","packet transfer","bypass datapath","prediction hit rate algorithm","fat tree","tori","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"Network-on-Chips (NoCs) are quite latency sensitive, since their communication latency strongly affects the application performance on recent many-core architectures. To reduce the communication latency, we propose a low-latency router architecture that predicts an output channel being used by the next packet transfer and speculatively completes the switch arbitration. In the prediction routers, incoming packets are transferred without waiting the routing computation and switch arbitration if the prediction hits. Thus, the primary concern for reducing the communication latency is the hit rates of prediction algorithms, which vary from the network environments, such as the network topology, routing algorithm, and traffic pattern. Although typical low-latency routers that speculatively skip one or more pipeline stages use a bypass datapath for specific packet transfers (e.g., packets moving on the same dimension), our prediction router predictively forwards packets based on a prediction algorithm selected from several candidates in response to the network environments. In this paper, we analyze the prediction hit rates of six prediction algorithms on meshes, tori, and fat trees. Then we provide three case studies, each of which assumes different many-core architecture. We have implemented a prediction router for each case study by using a 65 nm CMOS process, and evaluated them in terms of the prediction hit rate, zero load latency, hardware amount, and energy consumption. The results show that although the area and energy are increased by 6.4-15.9% and 8.0-9.5% respectively, up to 89.8% of the prediction hit rate is achieved in real applications, which provide favorable trade-offs between the modest hardware/energy overheads and the latency saving.","doi":"10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798274","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/4795428/4798227/04798274.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction router: Yet another low latency on-chip router architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798274/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction router: Yet another low latency on-chip router architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10502357","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798274/","conferenceDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction router: Yet another low latency on-chip router architecture","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"046 Session5B_2_Matsutani_hpca09_203_bates.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101824S","chronDate":"14-18 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4795428","isNumber":"4798227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4795428","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4798227","articleId":"4798274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4798278,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew DeOrio","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"DeOrio","id":"37541614700"},{"name":"Ilya Wagner","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37288962700"},{"name":"Valeria Bertacco","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Bertacco","id":"37267142300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0897"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4798278","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":619},"abstract":"The number of functional errors escaping design verification and being released into final silicon is growing, due to the increasing complexity and shrinking production schedules of modern processor designs. Recent trends towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are exacerbating the problem because of their complex and sometimes non-deterministic memory subsystems, prone to subtle but devastating bugs. This deteriorating situation calls for high-efficiency, high-coverage results in functional validation, results that are be achieved by leveraging the performance of post-silicon validation, that is, those verification tasks that are executed directly on prototype hardware. The orders-of-magnitude faster testing in post-silicon enables designers to achieve much higher coverage before customer release, but only if the limitations of this technology in diagnosis and internal node observability could be overcome. In this work, we unlock the full performance of post-silicon validation through Dacota, a new high-coverage solution for validating memory operation ordering in CMPs. When activated, Dacota reconfigures a portion of the cache storage to log memory accesses using a compact data-coloring scheme. Logs are periodically aggregated and checked by a distributed algorithm running in-situ on the CMP to verify correct memory operation ordering. When the design is ready for customer shipment, Dacota can be deactivated, releasing all cache storage, and only leaving a small silicon area footprint, less than 0.01% (three orders of magnitude smaller than previous solutions). We found experimentally that Dacota is effective in exposing memory subsystem bugs, and it delivers its high coverage capabilities at a 26% performance slowdown (only during validation) for real-world applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Computer bugs","Cache storage","Production","Processor scheduling","Process

The proposed scheme is an alternative viable method to conventional means of no-load and blocked rotor tests. The identification of motor parameters is redrafted as a multi-objective optimization problem and solution is sought through conventional optimization method as well as genetic algorithm (GA). The conventional method employed is the well known Rosenbrock's (RB) rotating coordinates method. When the results of the two methods are analyzed, it is observed that while GA offers near optimal solution to the problem, the method of RB always results in global optima, provided initial values are chosen judiciously. Hence, it is proposed to combine these two methods to gain the advantages of both the methods. In such a hybrid optimization method, the task of global search is carried out by GA, while Rosenbrock's method is devoted to local search. Comparison of these two techniques are discussed and presented in conjunction with computed and practical results. It is shown that combination of GA with conventional method yields improved results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798346/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798346/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502587","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Induction motor Parameter Estimation using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induction motor Parameter Estimation using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045632S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4798347,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It enhances the energy-efficient and reliable operation of power system. Artificial neural networks are employed for nonlinear short term load forecasting owing to their powerful nonlinear mapping capabilities. These are generally trained through back-propagation, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial immune system (AIS). All these algorithms have specific benefits in terms of accuracy, speed of convergence and historical data requirement for training. In this paper a hybrid AIS is proposed, which is a combination of back-propagation with AIS to get faster convergence, lesser historical data requirement for training with a little compromise in accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798349/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502590","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798349/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short Term Load Forecasting using a Neural Network trained by A Hybrid Artificial Immune System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short Term Load Forecasting using a Neural Network trained by A Hybrid Artificial Immune System","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037697S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4798367,"authors":[{"name":"Rajeeb Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Majitar, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Rajeeb","lastName":"Dey","id":"37850490100"},{"name":"Vaibhav Bajpai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Majitar, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Bajpai","id":"37089051612"},{"name":"Gagan Gandhi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Majitar, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Gagan","lastName":"Gandhi","id":"38187178100"},{"name":"Barnali Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Majitar, Sikkim, India"],"firstName":"Barnali","lastName":"Dey","id":"38186350800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2806-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7011"}],"articleNumber":"4798367","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":578},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Diabetes","Insulin","Medical diagnostic imaging","Hospitals","Back","Testing","Paper technology","Sugar","Blood"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","diseases","medical diagnostic computing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","diabetes mellitus diagnostic","back propagation algorithm","knowledge classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","Back propagation algorithm (B.P)","Diabetes Mellitus","Sikkim"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798367","abstract":"The present work is a classification problem applied to diagnosis of diabetes mellitus using back propagation algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN).

The variation in soft handoff coverage area can be taken as the parameter influencing the performance parameters of the CDMA cellular system. In this paper, an analytical model is developed and analyzed for the concerned target cell in CDMA cellular network. The model proposed in this paper is based on priority reservation for handoff calls along with call queuing scheme for new as well as handoff calls. Separate queues are considered for both new as well as handoff calls. Two dimensional Markov birth-death process is used for modeling the problem. The handoff queue capacity is considered as function of soft handoff coverage area which depends on the two soft handoff threshold parameters T_ADD and T_DROP. Considering fixed cell radius, variation in soft handoff coverage area also varies the normal area for new calls. It is seen that change in normal cell area is inversely proportional to soft handoff coverage area. The effect of this variation which leads to change in handoff call queue capacity along with mobility of mobile user is analyzed for variation in network performance parameters new call blocking probability, handoff request blocking probability, new and handoff call time out probabilities and forced termination probability for handoff request. Increase in handoff call queue capacity effectively decreases handoff request blocking probability but leads to increment of new call blocking probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798375","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Queuing based Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA Cellular Network for Variation in Mobility and Soft Handoff Threshold","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Queuing based Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA Cellular Network for Variation in Mobility and Soft Handoff Threshold","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798375/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502616","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Queuing based Call Admission Control Scheme in CDMA Cellular Network for Variation in Mobility and Soft Handoff Threshold","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059721S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4798377,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Simulations with a realistic outdoor MIMO channel model, over a wide range of data rates shows that turbo aided ICE outperforms ICE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement of ICE for Orthogonal STBC MC-CDMA Systems over MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798381","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798381.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of ICE for Orthogonal STBC MC-CDMA Systems over MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798381/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of ICE for Orthogonal STBC MC-CDMA Systems over MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057972S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4798382,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Here each user may experience a different CFO relative to the base station. This results in a multiple parameter estimation problem. The estimation is done by minimizing a cost function that computes the energy in null subcarrier locations due to the impact of frequency offset. The computational complexity and training overhead of the proposed technique are much lower as compared to some of the existing schemes in the literature. The mean square error of the CFO estimator and bit error rate performance of the OFDMA receiver that employs the proposed estimation scheme are studied through computer simulations. Our algorithm is shown to achieve a comparable performance as that of a recently reported method but with a much lower computational complexity and bandwidth overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798382.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Maximum Likelihood CFO Estimation Technique for OFDMA Uplink Transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency estimation","Frequency conversion","Computational complexity","Base stations","Parameter estimation","Cost function","Mean square error methods","Bit error rate","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood CFO estimation technique","OFDMA uplink transmissions","carrier frequency offset estimation technique","uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access communication system","multiple parameter estimation problem","cost function minimization","null subcarrier locations","computational complexity","mean square error estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","Carrier assignment schemes (CAS)","Null subcarriers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Maximum Likelihood CFO Estimation Technique for OFDMA Uplink Transmissions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502623","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Maximum Likelihood CFO Estimation Technique for OFDMA Uplink Transmissions","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053894S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4798386,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2806-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7011"}],"articleNumber":"4798386","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Array signal processing","Direction of arrival estimation","Quality of service","Interference","Data engineering","Paper technology","Electronic mail","Throughput","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","direction-of-arrival estimation","error statistics","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data services","cellular CDMA","soft handoff","beamforming","performance analysis","BER","direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","ARQ","Throughput","Soft handoff"]}],"abstract":"Performance analysis of data services is studied in CDMA network in presence of beamforming and soft handoff (HO).

The combined effects of soft handoff parameters, truncated power control at physical layer and truncated ARQ at data link layer on throughput and delay performance of packet data under a prescribed delay constrain is studied. Truncated power control improves the performance by suspending transmissions of mobiles under deep fade along with soft handoff while further improvement is obtained by retransmission at link layer. A variable packet length scheme is studied where packet size is adjusted under different traffic and soft handoff conditions so as to maintain a prescribed level of packet loss associated with T-ARQ.

The tree multipliers have time complexity of O (log n) but are unsuitable for VLSI implementation since they require larger total routing length, which may degrade performance. The properties of simpler VLSI implementation can be combined with fully pipelined circuit design using CMOS TSPC (true single phase clock) logic design style to improve throughput of array multipliers. In this paper an improved high speed, fully pipelined 8times8 signed Baugh Wooley multiplier circuit has been designed and implemented using CMOS TSPC logic in 0.6 mum, N-well CMOS process (SCN_SUBM, lambda=0.3) of MOSIS utilizing optimized TSPC logic cells. The simulation results after parasitic extraction show that the inputs can be applied every clock and it can produce correct output after 17 clock cycles at 500 MHz clock rate.

This approach may solve the following problems: (1) time-consuming of learning in back-propagation neural network, (2) fluctuation of the values of parameters due to noise and fading (3) fuzzy linguistic-term judgment for signal classification. An FRBF network with fewer rules than classes to be discriminated is unable to recognize some classes, while, when the number of rules is increased up to the number of classes to be discriminated, a sharp increase in the performance is observed. Experimental results point out that the behavior of the FRBF network is closer to that of a competitive model showing a strong specialization of the fuzzy rules. Also the raw extracted features which form the input to the FRBF are weighted which enhances the effect of these features. By translating the importance of each feature using weights, the classifier leads to better results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798411","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798411.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minimal Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Network For Recognition Of Digitally Modulated Signals Of Multilevel Magnitude","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Radial basis function networks","Digital modulation","Neural networks","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Decision support systems","Signal processing","Fuzzy systems","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","decision support systems","fuzzy set theory","modulation","radial basis function networks","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy radial basis function neural network","digitally modulated signal recognition","multilevel magnitude","intelligent decision support system","identification","digital signal type","backpropagation neural network","fuzzy linguistic-term judgment","signal classification","FRBF network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital modulated signals","Fuzzy basis functions","Neuro-fuzzy systems","Structure identification","Principal component analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Minimal Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Network For Recognition Of Digitally Modulated Signals Of Multilevel Magnitude","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798411/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502651","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Minimal Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Network For Recognition Of Digitally Modulated Signals Of Multilevel Magnitude","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-99.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073172S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4798414,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed approach uses an index called the single contingency sensitivity (SCS) index to rank the system branches according to their suitability for installing TCSC and TCPST. Once the locations are identified, the problem of determining the optimal TCSC and TCPST parameters is formulated as an optimization problem and a GA based approach is applied to solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem.

This is a bandwidth efficient scheme to increase the number users or data rate in a fixed bandwidth. These schemes can be used to avoid the orthogonal code shortage problem to provide broadband wireless access in cellular communication. One of the efficient schemes to overload a CDMA system is to use two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms (O/O). The first set is assigned to the N users and the second set is assigned to the additional users. An iterative multistage detection (IMSD) technique is used to cancel interference between the two sets of users. In this paper, the BER performance of a new overloading scheme using orthogonal Gold code (OG/OG) sets is evaluated with soft decision interference cancellation scheme (SDIC). It is observed that this scheme provides 25% channel overloading for synchronous DS-CDMA system in an AWGN channel for spreading factor length N = 64, assuming perfect power control. The SNR degradation is about 0.35 dB as compared to single user bound at a BER of 1e-5. With imperfect power control, the BER performance degrades considerably and we can only overload up to 11% with an SNR degradation of about 1.25 dB as compared to perfect power control single user bound at a BER of 1e-5.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798426","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER of Overloaded Cellular DS-CDMA System with Imperfect Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798426/","displayDocTitle":"BER of Overloaded Cellular DS-CDMA System with Imperfect Power Control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502666","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798426/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER of Overloaded Cellular DS-CDMA System with Imperfect Power Control","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046267S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4798431,"authors":[{"name":"Mrinal Kanti Bhowmik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tripura University, Agartala, India"],"firstName":"Mrinal Kanti","lastName":"Bhowmik","id":"37596965700"},{"name":"Debotosh Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debotosh","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"37593537300"},{"name":"Mita Nasipuri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Mita","lastName":"Nasipuri","id":"37296677800"},{"name":"Dipak Kumar Basu","affiliation":["AICTE Emeritus"],"firstName":"Dipak Kumar","lastName":"Basu","id":"37296676500"},{"name":"Mahantapas Kundu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Mahantapas","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37286778200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2806-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7011"}],"articleNumber":"4798431","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multilayer perceptrons","Humans","Face recognition","Lighting","Image converters","Hair","Testing","Image databases","Region 10","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","polar-thermal eigenfaces","multilayer perceptron","human face recognition","thermal face images","polar coordinate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal infrared images","Polar conversion","Eigenspace projection","Multilayer Perceptron","Backpropagation learning","Face recognition","Classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition.

Fault detection and diagnosis in the early stages of damage is necessary to prevent their malfunctioning and failure during operation. Vibration monitoring is the most widely used and cost-effective monitoring technique to detect, locate and distinguish faults in rolling element bearings. This paper presents an algorithm using feed forward neural network for automated diagnosis of localized faults in rolling element bearings. Normal negative log-likelihood value and kurtosis value extracted from time-domain vibration signals are used as input features for the neural network. Trained neural networks are able to classify different states of the bearing with 100% accuracy. The proposed procedure requires only a few input features, resulting in simple preprocessing and faster training. Effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using the bearing vibration data obtained experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798444","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798444.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing using time-domain features and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798444/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing using time-domain features and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798444/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502684","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing using time-domain features and neural networks","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072369S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4798456,"authors":[{"name":"Susmita Chakraborty","affiliation":["G.S.Sanyal School of Telecommunications, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"38188120900"},{"name":"T.

So the joint optimization of application layer with lower layers is necessary to meet certain QoS requirements. In this paper, we propose a Cross-layer design approach that jointly optimizes the physical layer, data link layer and application layer for the transmission of video summary frames through wireless networks based on MIMO transmit/receive diversity with AMC at the physical layer and ARQ at the data link layer and source coding at the application layer. We model the finite-state Markov chain(FSMC) for the physical layer service and based on that, we then characterize the Lagrangian relaxation and Dynamic programming to find the optimal shortest path. The source coding as well as retransmission requests are based on the channel-state information (CSI) and the system controller is implemented in all the three physical, data-link and application layers. The numerical results revealed that our proposed cross-layer model with MIMO diversity schemes can efficiently achieve the distortion gain with same delay budget.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798475","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798475.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design Approach using MIMO System for Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Design Approach using MIMO System for Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798475/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502715","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798475/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Design Approach using MIMO System for Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054869S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4798481,"authors":[{"name":"Siva Ram Krishna Vadali","affiliation":["G.

A major limitation of SLM-OFDM systems is that the receiver requires exact information of the phase set used at the transmitter. Usually side information (SI) is either transmitted explicitly at the loss of data rate or avoided using Blind SLM (BSLM) techniques at the expense of computational complexity. In the present work we investigate four SLM based PAPR reduction techniques and propose a new technique for pilot based SLM-OFDM systems which avoids the requirement of SI with low complexity. The proposed scheme involves cyclic shifting of pilots for each of the independent mapping in SLM systems. We compute a minimum distance vector at the receiver to detect the exact phase set used in the transmitter and avoid explicit transmission of SI. Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in AWGN channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798481","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798481.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Scheme without Side Information for Pilot Assisted OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798481/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Scheme without Side Information for Pilot Assisted OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502721","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798481/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Scheme without Side Information for Pilot Assisted OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051267S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798483,"authors":[{"name":"Pannala Krishna Murthy","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Swarna Bharathi Institute of Science and Technology, Khammam, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Pannala Krishna","lastName":"Murthy","id":"38185987700"},{"name":"J.

Simulation is carried out on frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel and antenna diversity is applied at base station (BS). Weight factors for diversity implementation are calculated based on the value of SIR (signal to interference ratio) of individual antenna system. GA is used to partition different users into groups of different blocks namely very strong, strong, weak and very weak based on the normalized magnitudes of their decision variables. We have reported the performance of the GA based block PIC system of four block, three block and two block with conventional PIC. A significant improvement in performance and capacity is seen with GA based block PIC relative to conventional PIC at the cost of slight increase in computation complexity. Simulation results show that BER is reduced as the number of users are divided into more number of blocks and the optimal partitioning of the blocks obtained by using GA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796894/4798312/04798486.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Region 10 and the Third international Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2008.4798486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity Assisted Block PIC for synchronous CI/MC-CDMA uplink system using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Genetic algorithms","Multiuser detection","Interference cancellation","Interferometry","Frequency diversity","Fading","Base stations","Costs","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","genetic algorithms","interference (signal)","interference suppression","multiuser detection","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multiuser detection","block parallel interference cancellation","carrier interferometry","multicarrier-code division multiple access","CI/MC-CDMA","Rayleigh fading channel","antenna diversity","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block PIC","Carrier Interferometry code","Diversity","Genetic Algorithm","MC-CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Assisted Block PIC for synchronous CI/MC-CDMA uplink system using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798486/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502725","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Assisted Block PIC for synchronous CI/MC-CDMA uplink system using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"ICIINFS-00-174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04942S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796894","isNumber":"4798312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4798312","articleId":"4798486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798558,"authors":[{"name":"Z.S.

In other cases the genetic algorithm can be recommended as alternative method (optimal reactive power planning) or as a part of combined approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798558/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502141","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798558/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms in power engineering problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms in power engineering problems","confLoc":"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","sourcePdf":"IFOST-058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058551S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4786612","isNumber":"4798500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786612","xplore-issue":"4798500","articleId":"4798558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4798676,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung Suk Chu","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung Suk Chu","id":"37335086000"},{"name":"Byung Su Park","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Su","lastName":"Park","id":"38189500900"},{"name":"Chong Koo An","affiliation":["University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chong Koo An","id":"37326910700"},{"name":"Jung Sun Kang","affiliation":["School ofElectricity, Electronics & Communications, Ulsan College, Ulsan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung Sun Kang","id":"38187430900"},{"name":"Hui-Geun Son","affiliation":["Powell Techwin Company Limited"],"lastName":"Hui-Geun Son","id":"38187593300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3589-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1831-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4798676","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image communication","Adaptive systems","OFDM modulation","Image coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Channel estimation","Bit rate","PSNR","Digital audio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","channel estimation","data compression","image coding","OFDM modulation","quadtrees","visual communication","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless image transmission","adaptive OFDM system","image transmission system","wavelet based image compression algorithm","position information","quad-tree information","EZW method","modulation bit","channel condition","channel estimation algorithm","compression bit rate","adaptive modulation","fixed modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image transmission systeln","Adaptive OFDM","Wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the image transmission system, that consists of the wavelet based image compression algorithm and the adaptive OFDM system.

A prosthetic arm is used to compensate for the lost functions of the AE amputees absent arm. A number of commercial prosthetic arm have been developed since last few decades. However, many amputees have not used them due to the discrepancy between their expectations and the reality. One of the main factors that cause the loss of interest in current commercial prosthetic arm is the lack of desired DOF (degree of freedom) that results unnatural arm motion. In this paper, a 5 DOF externally powered prosthetic arm for AE amputees is proposed to increase their mobility in daily life activities. The proposed prosthesis is designed to generate natural human like arm motion while performing a daily life task.

The movement decision is performed by a fuzzy control system, the inputs of which are the zero-mean normalized cross correlation (ZNCC) and the depth estimations at each time step. The suggested system can be used in any active binocular system and is computationally inexpensive. Moreover, the proposed system is independent to a priori camera calibration.","doi":"10.1109/UKRICIS.2008.4798931","publicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786971/4798915/04798931.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRICIS.2008.4798931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798915","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy vergence control for an active binocular vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy vergence control for an active binocular vision system","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798931/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10502278","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4798931/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy vergence control for an active binocular vision system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"Paper_23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049121S","chronDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786971","isNumber":"4798915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786971","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4798915","articleId":"4798931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4798943,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko Nentwig","affiliation":["Department of Vehicles, Production and Process Engineering, University of Applied Sciences Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Nentwig","id":"37586991300"},{"name":"Paolo Mercorelli","affiliation":["Department of Vehicles, Production and Process Engineering, University of Applied Sciences Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Mercorelli","id":"37277171400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2914-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2915-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4798943","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4798943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Inverse problems","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Neural networks","Robust control","Control systems","Wire","Mathematical model","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","flow control","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","internal combustion engines","neurocontrollers","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse local linear model tree","fuzzy neural network","robust throttle valve control","wire systems","feedforward controller","mathematical inversions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/UKRICIS.2008.4798943","pdfPath":"/iel5/4786971/4798915/04798943.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4798915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRICIS.2008.4798943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throttle valve control using an inverse local linear model tree based on a fuzzy neural network","abstract":"A robust throttle valve control has always been an attractive problem since throttle by wire systems were established in the mid-nineties. Often in control strategy, a feedforward controller is adopted in which an inverse model is used. Mathematical inversions of models imply a high order of differentiation of the state variables and consequently noise effects. In general, neural networks are a very effective and popular tool mostly used for modeling. The inversion of a neural network produces real possibilities to involve the networks in the control problem schemes. This paper presents a control strategy based upon an inversion of a feed forward trained local linear model tree. The local linear model tree is realized through a fuzzy neural network. Simulated results from real data measurements are presented in which two control loops are explicitly compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4798943/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10502290","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4798943/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2009","conferenceDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Throttle valve control using an inverse local linear model tree based on a fuzzy neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throttle valve control using an inverse local linear model tree based on a fuzzy neural network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"Paper_34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03953S","chronDate":"9-10 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4786971","isNumber":"4798915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4786971","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4798915","articleId":"4798943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4798952,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed online learning algorithm updates the weights and biases of the neural network using the error between the setpoint and the real output. Square and sinusoidal reference command signals are used to test the performance of the controller. It is noted that a reasonable tracking response is exhibited in the presence of inversion errors caused by model uncertainty.

The frequency diversity inherent in SC is picked up from the increased channel selectivity of CDD. The noise or intersymbol interference enhanced by equalization for highly selective channels is then mitigated through applying FDTE at the receiver.

Although the proposed system can achieve the enhanced bit error rate (BER) performance compared to that of conventional OFDM systems, there is an important peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issue of using the IP that needs to be resolved. In this letter, we propose decision criteria for determining the power boosting factor (PBF) of IP in practical IP-OFDM systems with a high power amplifier (HPA). The analysis is performed with two criteria, the complementary cumulative distribution function of signal PAPR and the input back-off to determine the PBF of IP. The best PBF can be the one which gives an equal power to the IP and the rest of the OFDM symbol. From the analytic results, however, the PBF maximizing the power of the IP out of the HPA turns out to be the best one due to the non-linearities of the HPA. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision criteria for IP-OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical determination of impulse sample power boosting factor in impulse postfix OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2009.082052","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4799008/04799019.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2009.082052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Practical determination of impulse sample power boosting factor in impulse postfix OFDM systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4799019/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical determination of impulse sample power boosting factor in impulse postfix OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"0187-cl0903-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036893S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4799008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4799008","articleId":"4799019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":4799020,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Spectrum handover may result in degraded system performance because of the different propagation loss of the different frequency. In this case, data transmission is disrupted and it is more difficult to provide seamless service. Here, we propose a seamless handover scheme based on the prediction of cell coverage. The proposed handover scheme can avoid service disruption and can reduce redundant handovers.

By modelling the phase uncertainty either as an unknown deterministic variable/process or random variable/ process with a known a priori probability density function, a number of non-Bayesian and Bayesian detection algorithms with various amount of suboptimality have been proposed in the literature to solve the problem. In this paper, a new set of suboptimal iterative detection algorithms is obtained by utilizing the variational bounding technique. Especially, applying the generic variational Bayesian (VB) framework, efficient iterative joint estimation and detection/decoding schemes are derived for the constant phase model as well as for the dynamic phase model. In addition, the relation of the VB-based approach to the optimal noncoherent receiver as well as to the classical approach via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is provided. Performance of the proposed detectors in the presence of a strong dynamic phase noise is compared to the performance of the existing detectors. Furthermore, an incremental scheduling of the VB (or EM) algorithm is shown to reduce the overall complexity of the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799047.pdf","startPage":"716","endPage":"725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive iterative detectors for phase-uncertain channels via variational bounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799047/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive iterative detectors for phase-uncertain channels via variational bounding","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505365","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799047/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive iterative detectors for phase-uncertain channels via variational bounding","sourcePdf":"0716-tc0903-nissila.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082397S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4799048,"authors":[{"name":"M.

More precisely, we consider channels with unknown parameters and apply the concept of detection by multiple trellises to forward-backward (FB) algorithms. The key idea of our approach consists, first, of properly quantizing the channel parameters and, then, considering replication of coherent FB algorithms operating on parallel trellises, one per hypothetical quantized value. In order to make the receiver robust against a possibly time-varying channel parameters, the proposed soft-output algorithms perform a proper \"manipulation\" of the forward and backward metrics computed by the parallel FB algorithms at regularly spaced trellis steps. We consider two significant examples of application: detection over (i) phase-uncertain channels and (ii) fading channels. The performance of the proposed algorithms is investigated considering differentially encoded (DE) quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) and iterative detection schemes based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Besides having a low complexity, the proposed soft-output algorithms turn out to be robust, flexible, blind, in the sense that no knowledge of the channel parameter statistics is required, and highly parallelizable, as it is desirable in high-throughput future wireless communication systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Robustness","Phase detection","Parity check codes","Time-varying channels","Concurrent computing","Fading","Phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","parity check codes","quadrature phase shift keying","statistical analysis","time-varying channels","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple trellises","trellis-based detection","forward-backward algorithms","channel parameters","hypothetical quantized value","time-varying channel parameters","forward-backward metrics","phase-uncertain channels","fading channels","quaternary phase shift keying","differential encoding","low-density parity-check","LDPC codes","soft-output algorithms","channel parameter statistics","wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward backwards algorithm, non-coherent detection, soft-input soft-output detection, LDPC codes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799048.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection by multiple trellises","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection by multiple trellises","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799048/","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799048/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10517035","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection by multiple trellises","sourcePdf":"0726-tc0903-franceschini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07318S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4799049,"authors":[{"name":"D.

To avoid the extensive information exchange with the access point for the uplink access in centralized approaches, we propose in this paper a distributed opportunistic access scheme. Through a judicious design of a novel backoff mechanism to utilize the channel information and reduce collisions, significant multiuser diversity gains are achieved. To a user, the higher the channel gain is, the smaller the backoff time-slot and, hence, the higher the access priority of that user is. In addition, for heterogeneous systems, our proposed scheme can realize multiuser diversity gains and achieve fairness among the users at the same time. Finally, we design two distributed opportunistic access schemes for OFDMA systems. Users contend on all sub-channels in the first scheme and only on several strongest sub-channels in the second scheme. Compared with traditional centralized OFDMA systems and other distributed access schemes, our proposed schemes reduce overhead and achieve a higher throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","startPage":"738","endPage":"746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed opportunistic access scheme and its application to OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A distributed opportunistic access scheme and its application to OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799049/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505369","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799049/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed opportunistic access scheme and its application to OFDMA systems","sourcePdf":"0738-tc0903-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08249S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4799050,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent K.

The main purpose is to reduce the receiver complexity of the cyclic prefix code division multiple access (CP-CDMA) over the downlink channel and to enable parallel transmission over the uplink channel. The receiver complexity has been found for requiring full-band FFT and IFFT calculations in the channel equalizer. To handle this problem, we developed the comb spectrum codes organized in frequency orthogonal groups, in each of which the codes have time correlation orthogonality. For the downlink channel, the reduction of complexity in signal processing of a CSCDMA receiver is due to that the separation of groups is simple and each separated group is in the form of a narrower bandwidth CP-CDMA. Thus, the full-band FFT and IFFT can be replaced by the partial FFT and partial IFFT as shown in this proposed approach. For the uplink channel, we assign the code groups to different users to form a group division multiple access (GDMA) for enabling an independent channel equalization of each user at base station. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results agree well with each other and both confirm the effectiveness of this approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of comb spectrum code for multiple access scheme","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.050152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799051.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.050152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"On the design of comb spectrum code for multiple access scheme","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4799051/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505372","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of comb spectrum code for multiple access scheme","sourcePdf":"0754-tc0903-cheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091596S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4799053,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

Specifically, imperfect CSI is accounted for with respect to both estimation and prediction errors, thereby allowing to quantify the performance degradation of the adaptive PSAM-based TB system due to both channel estimation and prediction errors. Such errors entail a mismatch between the optimal transmit/receive beamforming weights and the transmission rate implied by the true CSI on the one hand, and the actual values of these quantities as determined based on the estimated and predicted CSI, on the other hand. The compound effect of both estimation and prediction errors on the overall system performance is assessed in terms of the achievable average spectral efficiency, average bit error probability and outage probability, for which approximate closed-form expressions are derived for arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas. Furthermore, the latter metrics are used to optimize the PSAM parameters, namely the power allocation between data and pilot symbols as well as the pilot spacing in order to maximize the achievable average spectral efficiency while adhering to a fixed target bit error probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized rate-adaptive PSAM for MIMO MRC systems with transmit and receive CSI imperfections","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799058.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimized rate-adaptive PSAM for MIMO MRC systems with transmit and receive CSI imperfections","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4799058/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505375","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized rate-adaptive PSAM for MIMO MRC systems with transmit and receive CSI imperfections","sourcePdf":"0821-tc0903-maaref.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061595S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799059,"authors":[{"name":"Sumanth Jagannathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA","Wireless Connectivity Group, Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4799026/4799059/4799059-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sumanth Jagannathan received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, India, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

The DSL binder's metallic sheath is used as a common reference to obtain reliable channels for the common-mode signals. The direct and crosstalk channels for the common-mode signal are obtained using multi-conductor transmission line theory, and the data-rate improvement by exploiting these extra dimensions is presented. The lines in the binder are coordinated to cancel differential-mode crosstalk and also to avoid interference caused by radiation from the common-mode within the binder. The high level of common-mode noise is countered by exploiting the correlation between the differential- and common-mode noises. Numerical results based on the derived models show data-rate improvements of up to 100% compared to using only differential-mode transmission.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","DSL","Crosstalk","MIMO","Noise cancellation","Noise level","Multiconductor transmission lines","Conductors","Bonding","Transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","data communication","digital subscriber lines","interference suppression","multiconductor transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common-mode data transmission","binder sheath","digital subscriber lines","DSL transmission","DSL binder metallic sheath","common-mode signals","multiconductor transmission line theory","differential-mode crosstalk cancellation","interference avoidance","differential-mode transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode, crosstalk, digital-subscriberline (DSL), MIMO systems, multiconductor transmission lines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799059.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.070050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common-mode data transmission using the binder sheath in digital subscriber lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Common-mode data transmission using the binder sheath in digital subscriber lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799059/","volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799059/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10517044","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common-mode data transmission using the binder sheath in digital subscriber lines","sourcePdf":"0831-tc0903-jagannathan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075599S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4799060,"authors":[{"name":"Frode Bohagen","affiliation":["Telenor Research and Innovation, Oslo, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4799026/4799060/4799060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frode B\u00f8hagen was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1978.

In this paper, based on an innovative concept of layered FFT structure, we propose novel quadrature OFDMA (Q-OFDMA) systems which can overcome these problems. In particular, the proposed systems can achieve the same guard-interval overhead and same bandwidth occupation to conventional OFDMA systems, while with reduced PAPR and improved CFO robustness and frequency diversity. Q-OFDMA systems also promise low complexity in downlink receivers. Parameter configuration is investigated for both predefined and adaptive users data rates. Theoretical comparison of bit error rate (BER) performance between Q-OFDMA and OFDMA is conducted, and validated by simulation results. It is shown that Q-OFDMA systems could achieve better performance than OFDMA when signal to noise ratio (SNR) is above a threshold depending on the channel condition, and advanced equalizers, such as minimum mean square error equalizer, can significantly decrease this threshold due to the large frequency diversity in Q-OFDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","startPage":"850","endPage":"860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature OFDMA systems based on layered FFT structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature OFDMA systems based on layered FFT structure","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505376","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature OFDMA systems based on layered FFT structure","sourcePdf":"0850-tc0903-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106946S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799062,"authors":[{"name":"Heunchul Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4799026/4799062/4799062-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heunchul Lee (S'04-M'08) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.

We divide the precoding process into two steps: orthogonalization transformation which induces orthogonality between transmitted signals and beamforming transformation which achieves diversity gain. In the proposed method, we utilize a design criterion based on the minimum Euclidean distance between the received signals and then the vector orthogonalization is connected to the vector-norm maximization. In this paper, we focus on spatial multiplexing systems transmitting two independent data streams. Compared with the SVD based schemes, the proposed approach maintains a low complexity by relying only on three different kinds of rotation matrices for both the orthogonalization and beamforming transformation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed two step precoding achieves the better performance than the conventional SVD based MIMO precodings with reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4799026/04799062.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.03.060633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799026","startPage":"861","endPage":"870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new two-step precoding strategy for closed-loop MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new two-step precoding strategy for closed-loop MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10505377","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799062/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new two-step precoding strategy for closed-loop MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"0861-tc0903-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078111S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4799026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4799026","articleId":"4799062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799108,"authors":[{"name":"Pietro Valdastri","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Center of Research in Microengineering (CRIM) Laboratory, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5277110/4799108/4799108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pietro Valdastri (M'05) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering (honors) from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in bioengineering from Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2006.","He is currently engaged in several European projects for the development of minimally invasive and wireless biomedical devices.

The new mechanism is compact and strikes a balance between conflicting design objectives, exhibiting high foot forces and low power consumption. It enables a small robot to traverse a compliant, slippery, tubular environment, even while climbing against gravity. This mechanism is useful for many mesoscale locomotion tasks, including endoscopic capsule robot locomotion in the gastrointestinal tract. It has enabled fabrication of the first legged endoscopic capsule robot whose mechanical components match the dimensions of commercial pill cameras (11 mm diameter by 25 mm long). A novel slot-follower mechanism driven via lead screw enables the mechanical components of the capsule robot to be as small while simultaneously generating 0.63 N average propulsive force at each leg tip. In this paper, we describe kinematic and static analyses of the lead screw and slot-follower mechanisms, optimization of design parameters, and experimental design and tuning of a gait suitable for locomotion.

The goal of the users is to maximize a system-wide utility function (e.g., weighted sum-rate of all users), subject to individual power constraints. A popular approach to solve the discretized version of this nonconvex problem is by Lagrangian dual relaxation. Unfortunately the discretized spectrum management problem is NP-hard and its Lagrangian dual is in general not equivalent to the primal formulation due to a positive duality gap. In this paper, we use a convexity result of Lyapunov to estimate the size of duality gap for the discretized spectrum management problem and show that the duality gap vanishes asymptotically at the rate \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n (1/radic\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n), where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the size of the uniform discretization of the shared spectrum.

Existing PARAFAC algorithms are computationally demanding and operate in batch mode - both serious drawbacks for on-line applications. When the data are serially acquired, or the underlying model changes with time, adaptive PARAFAC algorithms that can track the sought decomposition at low complexity would be highly desirable. This is a challenging task that has not been addressed in the literature, and the topic of this paper. Given an estimate of the PARAFAC decomposition of a tensor at instant t, we propose two adaptive algorithms to update the decomposition at instant t+1, the new tensor being obtained from the old one after appending a new slice in the 'time' dimension. The proposed algorithms can yield estimation performance that is very close to that obtained via repeated application of state-of-art batch algorithms, at orders of magnitude lower complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated using a MIMO radar application (tracking of directions of arrival and directions of departure) as an example.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2016885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2016885","endPage":"2310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4939475/04799120.pdf","startPage":"2299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Algorithms to Track the PARAFAC Decomposition of a Third-Order Tensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799120/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Algorithms to Track the PARAFAC Decomposition of a Third-Order Tensor","volume":"57","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10664166","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799120/","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Algorithms to Track the PARAFAC Decomposition of a Third-Order Tensor","sourcePdf":"57tsp06-dnion-2016885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087755S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4939475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4939475","articleId":"4799120","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799121,"authors":[{"name":"Beril Sirmacek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and the Computer Vision Research Laboratory, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4804105/4799121/4799121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beril S\u0131rma\u00e7ek (S'07) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Among these, urban-area boundaries and building locations play crucial roles. For a human expert, manually extracting this valuable information is tedious. One possible solution to extract this information is using automated techniques. Unfortunately, the solution is not straightforward if standard image processing and pattern recognition techniques are used. Therefore, to detect the urban area and buildings in satellite images, we propose the use of scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and graph theoretical tools. SIFT keypoints are powerful in detecting objects under various imaging conditions. However, SIFT is not sufficient for detecting urban areas and buildings alone. Therefore, we formalize the problem in terms of graph theory. In forming the graph, we represent each keypoint as a vertex of the graph. The unary and binary relationships between these vertices (such as spatial distance and intensity values) lead to the edges of the graph. Based on this formalism, we extract the urban area using a novel multiple subgraph matching method. Then, we extract separate buildings in the urban area using a novel graph cut method. We form a diverse and representative test set using panchromatic 1-m-resolution Ikonos imagery. By extensive testings, we report very promising results on automatically detecting urban areas and buildings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Urban-Area and Building Detection Using SIFT Keypoints and Graph Theory","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4804105/04799121.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804105","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Urban-Area and Building Detection Using SIFT Keypoints and Graph Theory","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4799121/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10545975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban-Area and Building Detection Using SIFT Keypoints and Graph Theory","sourcePdf":"tgrs-unsalan-2008440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084424S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4804105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"4804105","articleId":"4799121","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799125,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano Jacques Miosso","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Cristiano Jacques","lastName":"Miosso","id":"37391536600"},{"name":"Ricardo von Borries","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"von Borries","id":"37285014400"},{"name":"M.

The main idea of our technique is, using specific properties of the orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs), to estimate the finite impulse response (FIR) channel parameters in the time domain instead of doing this in the frequency domain independently for each subcarrier. This results in a substantially improved parsimony of the channel parametric model as compared to the direct per subcarrier channel estimation methods and allows coherent processing across the subcarriers. It is shown that using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, our channel estimation problem can be approximated as a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and, hence, can be solved efficiently using modern convex optimization methods. Our simulations validate the performance and/or computational complexity advantages of the proposed method as compared to some current state-of-the-art blind MIMO-OFDM channel estimation methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2016887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4939475/04799128.pdf","startPage":"2354","endPage":"2364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2016887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation in Orthogonally Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems: A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799128/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Channel Estimation in Orthogonally Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems: A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664167","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799128/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Channel Estimation in Orthogonally Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems: A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach","sourcePdf":"57tsp06-agershman-2016887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091966S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4939475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4939475","articleId":"4799128","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799130,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Moez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Moez","id":"37530742500"},{"name":"Mohamed Elmasry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elmasry","id":"37276008000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4799130","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Distributed amplifiers","Optical losses","Propagation losses","Distributed parameter circuits","Bandwidth","Optical fiber communication","CMOS process","Gain","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","distributed amplifiers","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss compensation technique","CMOS distributed amplifiers","onchip transmission lines","optical communication","CMOS process","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","inductors","lossy circuits","radio frequency amplifiers","transmission lines (TLs)","wideband amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799130","abstract":"This brief presents a circuit technique to compensate for the metal and substrate loss of the on-chip transmission lines (TLs), and, consequently, to improve the gain flatness and bandwidth of CMOS distributed amplifiers (DAs).

This mechanism is an issue in any power amplifier application where a high degree of proportionality between input and output is required, such as in audio power amplifiers or xDSL drivers. From an average-mode point of view, carrier distortion is shown to be caused by nonlinear variation of the hysteretic comparator input average voltage with the output average voltage. This easily causes total harmonic distortion figures in excess of 0.1-0.2%, inadequate for high-quality audio applications. Carrier distortion is shown to be minimized when the feedback system is designed to provide a triangular carrier (sliding) signal at the input of a hysteretic comparator. The proposed optimization method is experimentally proven in an audio power amplifier leading to THD figures that are comparable to the state of the art. Experimental hardware is a hysteretic SO bandpass current-mode-controlled single-ended audio power amplifier capable of 45 W into 8 Omega or 80 W into 4Omega from a plusmn34 V supply with less than 0.03% THD from 100 Hz to 6.7 kHz.

Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution and reconstruction, and compressed sensing (CS) are a few well-known areas in which problems of this type appear. One standard approach is to minimize an objective function that includes a quadratic (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">lscr</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n) error term added to a sparsity-inducing (usually lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n) regularizater. We present an algorithmic framework for the more general problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex regularizer. We propose iterative methods in which each step is obtained by solving an optimization subproblem involving a quadratic term with diagonal Hessian (i.e., separable in the unknowns) plus the original sparsity-inducing regularizer; our approach is suitable for cases in which this subproblem can be solved much more rapidly than the original problem. Under mild conditions (namely convexity of the regularizer), we prove convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm to a minimum of the objective function.

The tristate boost converter contains an additional switch across the inductor. Within a clock cycle, the inductor current first rises during the on interval of the main switch, then falls during the off or capacitor charging interval, and finally, remains almost constant during the freewheeling interval when the additional switch is turned on. In the proposed controller, the peak value of the inductor current is controlled by peak current mode control using an outer voltage feedback loop, whereas the freewheeling current is controlled by the input voltage and the reference voltage feedforward path. Applying both feedback as well as feedforward control on the inductor current significantly improves the output voltage regulation, audio susceptibility, and transient responses. We show that the RHP zero is completely eliminated from the closed-loop control-to-output transfer function. This results in a very large bandwidth, and hence a superior dynamic performance. The latter is established by comparison with the voltage-mode- and current-mode-controlled classical boost converters that suffer from the RHP zero problem, as well as with other tristate boost converter control techniques like the constant charging interval and dual mode control, recently proposed in the literature. Significant superiority of the proposed scheme is established both through simulation and experimentation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2008994","startPage":"776","endPage":"786","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04799139.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2008994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Current-Controlled Tristate Boost Converter With Improved Performance Through RHP Zero Elimination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Switches","Inductors","Circuits","Switching converters","Clocks","Capacitors","Feedback loop","Output feedback","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-controlled tristate boost converter","right-half plane zero elimination","peak current mode control","feedforward control","closed-loop control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bifurcation","dc\u2013dc power conversion","feedback systems","feedforward systems","pulsewidth modulated power converters","stability criteria","switching circuits","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Current-Controlled Tristate Boost Converter With Improved Performance Through RHP Zero Elimination","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4799139/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10586861","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Current-Controlled Tristate Boost Converter With Improved Performance Through RHP Zero Elimination","sourcePdf":"tpel-kapat-2008994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094295S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4799139","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4799141,"authors":[{"name":"Shing-Tai Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5165248/4799141/4799141-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shing-Tai Pan was born in Pingtung, Taiwan, on November 4, 1966.

Unlike existing research on designing IIR filters by using GA, in which the stability of IIR filters is tested by trial and error after the evolution of each generation of a GA, the stability criterion in this paper is embedded within the evolution of each generation. Consequently, the stability of this system can be guaranteed without the need for any other checks of the stability criterion in the evolution of each generation. Numerical experimental results are discussed to illustrate the soundness of the proposed evolution strategy. The robustness of the IIR filters is achieved by ensuring that all poles of the filters are located inside a disk \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i>\n(alpha,\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i>\n) contained in the unit circle, in which \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">alpha</i>\n is the center, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i>\n is the radius of the disk and IalphaI +r < 1 .

With the transformation from the array output power and the magnitude response to linear functions of the autocorrelation sequence of the array weight, the optimization of an adaptive beamformer, which is often described as a quadratic optimization problem in conventional beamforming methods, is then reformulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Unlike conventional robust beamformers, the proposed method is able to flexibly control the robust response region with specified beamwidth and response ripple. In practice, an array has many imperfections besides steering direction error. In order to make the adaptive beamformer robust against all kinds of imperfections, worst-case optimization is exploited to reconstruct the robust beamformer. By minimizing array output power with the existence of the worst-case array imperfections, the robust beamforming can be expressed as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. The resultant beamformer possesses superior robustness against arbitrary array imperfections. With the proposed methods, a large robust response region and a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) enhancement can be achieved readily. Simple implementation, flexible performance control, as well as significant SINR enhancement, support the practicability of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","volume":"57","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10704918","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799142/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamformers Based on Worst-Case Optimization and Constraints on Magnitude Response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamformers Based on Worst-Case Optimization and Constraints on Magnitude Response","sourcePdf":"tsp-yu-2017004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10421S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5076146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5076146","articleId":"4799142","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4799144,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Sun","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37276411300"},{"name":"Bing Sun","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37396937400"},{"name":"Lifeng Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406794700"},{"name":"Nuo Xu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nuo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37577119200"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280578200"},{"name":"Ruqi Han","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruqi","lastName":"Han","id":"37279237900"},{"name":"Jinfeng Kang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Kang","id":"37273713100"},{"name":"Guangcheng Xiong","affiliation":["Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangcheng","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37304554900"},{"name":"T.

To reduce the power consumption of the state metrics cache (SMC), low-power memory-reduced traceback maximum a posteriori algorithm (MAP) decoding is proposed. Instead of storing all state metrics, the traceback MAP decoding reduces the size of the SMC by accessing difference metrics. The proposed traceback computation requires no complicated reversion checker, path selection, and reversion flag cache. For double-binary (DB) MAP decoding, radix-2times2 and radix-4 traceback structures are introduced to provide a tradeoff between power consumption and operating frequency. These two traceback structures achieve an around 20% power reduction of the SMC, and around 7% power reduction of the DB MAP decoders. In addition, a high-throughput 12-mode WiMAX CTC decoder applying the proposed radix-2times2 traceback structure is implemented by using a 0.13-mum CMOS process in a core area of 7.16 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The proposed architecture takes advantage of the reduced number of operations of the RFFT with respect to the complex fast Fourier transform (CFFT), and requires less area while achieving higher throughput and lower latency. The architecture is based on a novel algorithm for the computation of the RFFT, which, contrary to previous approaches, presents a regular geometry suitable for the implementation of hardware structures. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for both the decimation in time (DIT) and decimation in frequency (DIF) decompositions of the RFFT and requires the lowest number of operations reported for radix 2. Finally, as in previous works, when calculating the RFFT the output samples are obtained in a scrambled order.

The requirements of synchronization in these cases, however, are quite different from the traditional use of IEEE 1588 for synchronization in control and instrumentation applications. For successful deployment in communication applications, it is necessary to consider the unique aspects of telecom sync and the interrelation of these factors with timing recovery using IEEE 1588. This paper discusses the error considerations that must be applied toward timing recovery in packet-timing implementations, particularly those targeted toward telecom sync. A review of basic rate-recovery concepts is used to identify the various sources of error and their effects. Simulation and experimental results are used to illustrate the impact of different factors on the recovered timing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799155/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10647786","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Timing Recovery for IEEE 1588 Applications in Telecommunications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Recovery for IEEE 1588 Applications in Telecommunications","sourcePdf":"tim-subrahmanyan-2013656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149549S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"4919430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4919430","articleId":"4799155","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4799159,"authors":[{"name":"Natchpong Hatti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4812314/4799159/4799159-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Natchpong Hatti (S'07) was born in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, in 1971.

The power conversion system consists of a front-end diode rectifier, a five-level diode-clamped pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverter with a voltage balancing circuit, and a hybrid active filter for harmonic-current mitigation of the diode rectifier. The control of the inverter is characterized by superimposing a third-harmonic zero-sequence voltage on each of the three-phase reference voltages to achieve the so-called overmodulation and reduce the switching stress of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). A 200-V 5.5-kW downscale model is designed, constructed, and tested with focus on the five-level PWM inverter and the voltage balancing circuit. Experimental results obtained from the 200-V downscale model verify the viability and effectiveness of the 6.6-kV adjustable-speed motor drive, showing that the four split dc capacitor voltages are well balanced in all the operating conditions and that the switching stress of the IGBTs is reduced at low modulation indexes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4812314/04799159.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2008995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2008995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6.6-kV Transformerless Motor Drive Using a Five-Level Diode-Clamped PWM Inverter for Energy Savings of Pumps and Blowers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motor drives","Diodes","Pulse width modulation inverters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Power transformer insulation","Rectifiers","Zero voltage switching","Stress","Circuit testing","Power conversion harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","harmonics suppression","insulated gate bipolar transistors","motor drives","power conversion","power semiconductor diodes","pumps","PWM invertors","rectifying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformerless motor drive","five-level diode-clamped PWM inverter","energy savings","pumps","blowers","adjustable-speed motor drive","power conversion system","front-end diode rectifier","pulsewidth modulation inverter","voltage balancing circuit","hybrid active filter","harmonic-current mitigation","third-harmonic zero-sequence voltage","three-phase reference voltages","four split dc capacitor voltage","IGBT","low modulation indexes","voltage 6.6 kV","voltage 200 V","power 5.5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy savings","medium-voltage drives","modulation indexes","multilevel inverters","voltage balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 6.6-kV Transformerless Motor Drive Using a Five-Level Diode-Clamped PWM Inverter for Energy Savings of Pumps and Blowers","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4799159/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10586857","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6.6-kV Transformerless Motor Drive Using a Five-Level Diode-Clamped PWM Inverter for Energy Savings of Pumps and Blowers","sourcePdf":"tpel-hatti-2008995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076179S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4812314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4812314","articleId":"4799159","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799161,"authors":[{"name":"Suiyang Khoo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/4814791/4799161/4799161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suiyang Khoo received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Tasmania University, Hobart, Australia, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","In 2008, he was a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia.

Although discovered more than 40 years ago, the phenomenon remains highly controversial in both experimental and theoretical terms. A considerable number of recent publications suggest that NBTI is caused by the following two independent mechanisms: 1) generation of defects close to the silicon/silicon dioxide interface and 2) hole trapping in the oxide. We have performed stress and recovery experiments at different temperatures and voltages that, quite surprisingly, reveal that all data can be scaled onto a single universal curve during stress, recovery, and restress. This suggests that in our samples, NBTI is caused by either a single dominant mechanism, which is more complicated than previously anticipated, or that the previously suggested mechanisms, i.e., hole trapping and defect creation, are actually tightly coupled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evidence That Two Tightly Coupled Mechanisms Are Responsible for Negative Bias Temperature Instability in Oxynitride MOSFETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2015160","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4839017/04799166.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2015160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4839017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Evidence That Two Tightly Coupled Mechanisms Are Responsible for Negative Bias Temperature Instability in Oxynitride MOSFETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4799166/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10587556","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evidence That Two Tightly Coupled Mechanisms Are Responsible for Negative Bias Temperature Instability in Oxynitride MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"ted-grasser-2015160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066576S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4839017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4839017","articleId":"4799166","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799172,"authors":[{"name":"Mona Kathryn Garvin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Mona Kathryn","lastName":"Garvin","id":"37391580800"},{"name":"Michael David Abramoff","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael David","lastName":"Abramoff","id":"37294650700"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281239800"},{"name":"Stephen R.

Thus, the need for 3-D segmentation methods for processing such data is becoming increasingly important. We report a graph-theoretic segmentation method for the simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3-D surfaces that is guaranteed to be optimal with respect to the cost function and that is directly applicable to the segmentation of 3-D spectral OCT image data. We present two extensions to the general layered graph segmentation method: the ability to incorporate varying feasibility constraints and the ability to incorporate true regional information. Appropriate feasibility constraints and cost functions were learned from a training set of 13 spectral-domain OCT images from 13 subjects. After training, our approach was tested on a test set of 28 images from 14 subjects. An overall mean unsigned border positioning error of 5.69 plusmn 2.41 mum was achieved when segmenting seven surfaces (six layers) and using the average of the manual tracings of two ophthalmologists as the reference standard.

This African vegetation is mainly composed of shrubs and grass. Since the coherent scattering model is computationally time-consuming, a simplified empirical model is constructed by fitting of simulation results obtained by the scattering model. Inputs to the empirical model are the sensitive parameters that, for the studied class of vegetation, are the soil moisture content, grass density, and grass moisture content. The model outputs are the polarimetric backscattering coefficients as a function of the incidence angle. Employing the empirical model and a genetic algorithm, a search routine is implemented to estimate the biophysical parameters of the African vegetation from a data set of backscattering coefficients. The estimation of Sahelian-grassland parameters using the set of C-band HH-polarized measured data shows that this procedure achieves good agreement with the ground-truth data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799177/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10545973","volume":"47","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4799177/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Sahelian-Grassland Parameters Using a Coherent Scattering Model and a Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Sahelian-Grassland Parameters Using a Coherent Scattering Model and a Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tgrs-monsivaishuertero-2008723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125052S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4804105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4804105","articleId":"4799177","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4799184,"authors":[{"name":"Shah M.

The vulnerability has been accentuated by increased variability in device parameters. In this paper, we present an analytical model for critical charge in order to assess the soft error vulnerability of 6T SRAM cell. The model takes into account the dynamic behavior of the cell and demonstrates a simple technique to decouple the nonlinearly coupled storage nodes. Decoupling of storage nodes enables solving associated current equations to determine the critical charge for an exponential noise current. The critical charge model thus developed consists of both NMOS and PMOS transistor parameters. Consequently, the model can estimate critical charge variations due to variability of transistor parameters and manufacturing defects, such as resistive contacts and vias. In addition, the model can serve as a tool to optimize the hibernation voltage of low-power SRAMs or the size of MIM capacitor per cell in order to achieve a target soft error robustness. Critical charge calculated by the model is in good agreement with SPICE simulations for a commercial 90-nm CMOS process with a maximum discrepancy of less than 5%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04799184.pdf","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Model for Soft Error Critical Charge of Nanometric SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model for Soft Error Critical Charge of Nanometric SRAMs","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828373","htmlLink":"/document/4799184/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Model for Soft Error Critical Charge of Nanometric SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jahinuzzaman-2003511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10602S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5208586","articleId":"4799184","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799187,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Kerber","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/5062529/4799187/4799187-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Kerber was born in Schnann, Austria, in 1973.

The modified objective functions are used in the nondominance sorting to facilitate the search of optimal solutions not only in the feasible space but also in the infeasible regions. The search in the infeasible space is designed to exploit those individuals with better objective values and lower constraint violations. The number of feasible individuals in the population is used to guide the search process either toward finding more feasible solutions or favor in search for optimal solutions. The proposed method is simple to implement and does not need any parameter tuning.

There is a lot of experimental effort at this time to implement switching circuits based on magnets and it is important to establish power requirements for such circuits and their dependence on various parameters. This paper analyzes switching energy that is dissipated in the switching process of single-domain ferromagnets used as cascadable logic bits. We obtain generic results that can be used for comparison with alternative technologies or guide the design of magnet-based switching circuits. Two central results are established. One is that the switching energy drops significantly if the ramp time of an external pulse exceeds a critical time. This drop occurs more rapidly than what is normally expected of adiabatic switching for a capacitor. The other result is that under the switching scheme that allows for logic operations, the switching energy can be described by a single equation in both fast and slow limits. Furthermore, these generic results are used to discuss the practical consideration such as dissipation versus speed, increasing the switching speed and scaling. It is further explained that nanomagnets can have scaling laws similar to CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2016657","startPage":"505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5165202/04799197.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2016657","endPage":"514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching Energy of Ferromagnetic Logic Bits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Switching Energy of Ferromagnetic Logic Bits","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4799197/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10764119","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching Energy of Ferromagnetic Logic Bits","sourcePdf":"tnano-behin-aein-2016657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147299S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5165202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5165202","articleId":"4799197","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799217,"authors":[{"name":"Man Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, Saint Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, NS, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/4799331/4799217/4799217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Man Lin (M'08) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1994.

Therefore, it is desirable and essential to fulfill security requirements in security-critical real-time systems. This paper addresses the issue of optimizing quality of security in real-time systems. To meet the needs of a wide variety of security requirements imposed by real-time systems, a group-based security service model is used in which the security services are partitioned into several groups depending on security types. While services within the same security group provide the identical type of security service, the services in the group can achieve different quality of security. Security services from a number of groups can be combined to deliver better quality of security. In this study, we seamlessly integrate the group-based security model with a traditional real-time scheduling algorithm, namely earliest deadline first (EDF). Moreover, we design and develop a security-aware EDF schedulability test. Given a set of real-time tasks with chosen security services, our scheduling scheme aims at optimizing the combined security value of the selected services while guaranteeing the schedulability of the real-time tasks. We study two approaches to solve the security-aware optimization problem. Experimental results show that the combined security values are substantially higher than those achieved by alternatives for real-time tasks without violating real-time constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/4799331/04799217.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2014055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2014055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Security Optimization for Real-Time Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Radar tracking","Information security","Control systems","Computer science","Rail transportation","Application software","Medical control systems","Scheduling algorithm","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","embedded systems","scheduling","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static security optimization","real-time systems","group-based security service model","real-time scheduling algorithm","earliest deadline first","security-aware optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded real-time systems","optimization","security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Static Security Optimization for Real-Time Systems","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4799217/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10505231","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Security Optimization for Real-Time Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-mlin-2014055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116119S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"4799331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4799331","articleId":"4799217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799221,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Thong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Thong","id":"37543647900"},{"name":"Nicola Nicolici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Nicolici","id":"37275575300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4799221","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"Common subexpression elimination (CSE) algorithms try to minimize the number of adders (or subtracters) required to implement constant multiplication by searching and substituting common patterns in the CSE representation of a constant. CSE algorithms, in general, cannot find certain patterns due to inherent restrictions in the CSE representation. We propose overlapping digit patterns (ODPs) to remove some of these restrictions. We integrate ODPs into H(k), the best existing heuristic algorithm for single constant multiplication (SCM). H(k) is not applicable to the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem, so we cannot consider this problem. Generally, H(k) finds solutions very close to optimal, so there is a strict limitation on any further improvement which applies to any new heuristic. Instead, by integrating ODPs within H(k), we can on average significantly improve the run time of the algorithm (typically by one order of magnitude) while still reducing the number of adders.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799221","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Adders","Heuristic algorithms","Hardware","Programmable logic devices","Costs","Circuits","Digital signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","Hartley transforms","logic circuits","programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-efficient single constant multiplication","overlapping digit patterns","common subexpression elimination algorithms","adders","subtracters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common subexpression elimination (CSE)","overlapping digit patterns (ODPs)","run time efficiency","single constant multiplication (SCM)"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04799221.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003004","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Efficient Single Constant Multiplication Based on Overlapping Digit Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799221/","displayDocTitle":"Time-Efficient Single Constant Multiplication Based on Overlapping Digit Patterns","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828385","htmlLink":"/document/4799221/","volume":"17","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Efficient Single Constant Multiplication Based on Overlapping Digit Patterns","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-nnicolici-2003004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07016S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5208586","articleId":"4799221","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799222,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5208586/4799222/4799222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei-Yin Chen (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1986, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, State College, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, in 1999.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University.

One novel level conversion flip-flop (CPN-LCFF) is proposed, which combines the conditional discharge technique and pseudo-NMOS technique.

The uncertainty in the critical delay of a circuit under process variations exists because the delay of each logic element in the circuit is no longer deterministic. Traditionally, FPGAs have been designed to manage process variations through speed binning, which works well for inter-die variations, but not for intra-die variations resulting in reduced timing yield for FPGAs. FPGAs present a unique challenge because of their programmability and unknown end user application. In this paper, a novel architecture and computer-aided design co-design technique is proposed to improve the timing yield. Experimental results indicate that the use of proposed design technique can achieve timing yield improvement of up to 68%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5419135/04799224.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2011555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Design for Timing Yield Under Process Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799224/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Design for Timing Yield Under Process Variations","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142355","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799224/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Design for Timing Yield Under Process Variations","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-akumar-2011555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114954S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5419135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5419135","articleId":"4799224","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799226,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Ney","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Ney","id":"37664189200"},{"name":"Patrick Girard","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Girard","id":"37273565500"},{"name":"Serge Pravossoudovitch","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Pravossoudovitch","id":"37272563100"},{"name":"Arnaud Virazel","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Virazel","id":"37267181100"},{"name":"Magali Bastian","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Magali","lastName":"Bastian","id":"37562954900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4799226","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Resistive-Open Defects in SRAM Sense Amplifiers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5247125/04799226.pdf","startPage":"1556","endPage":"1559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247125","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2005194","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Circuit faults","Operational amplifiers","Testing","Driver circuits","SRAM chips","Electrical fault detection","Read-write memory","Decoding","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","fault diagnosis","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM sense amplifiers","resistive-open defects","dynamic behavior","March tests","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic faults","March tests","resistive-open defects","sense amplifier","static RAM (sRAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799226","abstract":"In this paper, we present an exhaustive analysis of resistive- open defects in sense amplifiers of static random access memory designed with a 65 nm technology.

To achieve maximum efficiency for Class-E PA operating above gigahertz frequencies, the proposed design theory modifies the classic Class-E condition and considers switch-on and switch-off resistances in deriving the analytical solution. For linearization, a digital envelope predistorter (DEP) is used to provide predistorted envelope modulation for the RF-input and supply-voltage signals fed to the Class-E PA. This DEP can successfully compensate for AM/AM and AM/PM distortions such that the Class-E PA, although classified as a switching-mode PA, can act as a linear PA. A cdma2000 1 times transmitter incorporating this Class-E PA and DEP is demonstrated to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and high modulation quality.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2014444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4812261/04799230.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2014444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4812261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Linearization of Class-E Power Amplifier for Nonconstant Envelope Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799230/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Linearization of Class-E Power Amplifier for Nonconstant Envelope Modulation","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10571120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799230/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Linearization of Class-E Power Amplifier for Nonconstant Envelope Modulation","sourcePdf":"57tmtt04-thorng-part2-2014444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08794S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4812261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4812261","articleId":"4799230","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4799231,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Arbabian","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4812261/4799231/4799231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amin Arbabian (S'06) received the B.S. degree (ranked first in his field of electrical engineering, communications) from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, the M.S. degree from the University of California at Berkeley, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of California at Berkeley.","In 2004 and 2005, he was a Research Consultant and the leader of the \u201cTelecomm.

Pre-/postprocessing to improve video quality is becoming much more important because requirements for pre-/postprocessing vary among applications and processing algorithms have not been stabilized. Therefore, a new processor architecture that has a highly parallel datapath is needed. In this paper, we introduce a VLIW vector media coprocessor, ldquovector coprocessor (VCP),rdquo that includes three asymmetric execution pipelines with cascaded SIMD ALUs. To improve performance efficiency, we reduce the area ratio of the control circuit while increasing the ratio of the arithmetic circuit. The total gate count of VCP is 1268 kgates and its maximum operating frequency is 300 MHz at 90-nm CMOS process. Some of the processing kernels in an adaptive prefilter that is applied to preprocessing for video encoding are evaluated. In the case of the edgeness and the sum of absolute differences, the performance is 183 giga operations per second. VCP offers enough performance for HD video processing and good cost-performance while all processing pipeline units operate effectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04799236.pdf","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLIW Vector Media Coprocessor With Cascaded SIMD ALUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799236/","displayDocTitle":"A VLIW Vector Media Coprocessor With Cascaded SIMD ALUs","volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828376","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLIW Vector Media Coprocessor With Cascaded SIMD ALUs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tmiyamori-2003006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084849S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4799236","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799237,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hyo Yu","affiliation":["Mobile Next Generation Technology Group of System LSI Division, Semiconductor Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5247125/4799237/4799237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Hyo Yu (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from KAIST in 2007.","He is currently working on 3-D graphics programmable shader architecture and 2-D vector graphics accelerator architecture at Samsung Electronics, Giheung, Korea.

The proposed processor with the optimized datapath and vertex caches implemented in a 0.18- mum 1P4M CMOS process achieves 186-Mvertices/s geometry performance which is the best result among the processors that are IEEE-754 compliant.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5247125/04799237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247125","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 186-Mvertices/s 161-mW Floating-Point Vertex Processor With Optimized Datapath and Vertex Caches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 186-Mvertices/s 161-mW Floating-Point Vertex Processor With Optimized Datapath and Vertex Caches","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10870762","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 186-Mvertices/s 161-mW Floating-Point Vertex Processor With Optimized Datapath and Vertex Caches","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yu-2003515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066013S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5247125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5247125","articleId":"4799237","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799238,"authors":[{"name":"Sherief Reda","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Sherief","lastName":"Reda","id":"37273669500"},{"name":"Gregory Smith","affiliation":["SEMATECH, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Smith","id":"37276776600"},{"name":"Larry Smith","affiliation":["SEMATECH, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Smith","id":"37630086000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4799238","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":602},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional integrated circuit technology with through-silicon vias offers many advantages, including improved form factor, increased circuit performance, robust heterogenous integration, and reduced costs. Wafer-to-wafer integration supports the highest possible density of through-silicon vias and highest throughput; however, in contrast to die-to-wafer integration, it does not benefit from the ability to bond only tested and diced good die. In wafer-to-wafer integration, wafers are entirely bonded together, which can unintentionally integrate a bad die from one wafer to a good die from another wafer reducing the yield. In this paper, we propose solutions that maximize the yield of wafer-to-wafer 3-D integration, assuming that the individual die can be tested on the wafers before bonding. We exploit some of the available flexibility in the integration process, and propose wafer assignment algorithms that maximize the number of good 3-D ICs. Our algorithms range from scalable, fast heuristics to optimal methods that exactly maximize the yield of wafer-to-wafer 3-D integration. Using realistic defect models and yield simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods up to large numbers of wafer stacks. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to significantly improve the yield in comparison to yield-oblivious wafer assignment methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04799238.pdf","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2003513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing the Functional Yield of Wafer-to-Wafer 3-D Integration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wafer bonding","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit yield","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Integrated circuit technology","Circuit optimization","Robustness","Costs","Throughput","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic programming","integrated circuit yield","iterative methods","production engineering computing","wafer bonding","wafer-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional integrated circuit technology","through-silicon vias","wafer-to-wafer 3-D integration","bonding","die-to-wafer integration","fast heuristics algorithm","wafer assignment algorithms","iterative matching heuristic","yield simulations","realistic defect models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D IC","wafer to wafer integration","yield"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing the Functional Yield of Wafer-to-Wafer 3-D Integration","volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4799238/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828377","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing the Functional Yield of Wafer-to-Wafer 3-D Integration","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-reda-2003513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063781S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5208586","articleId":"4799238","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4799247,"authors":[{"name":"Pinaki Mazumder","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4802402/4799247/4799247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pinaki Mazumder (F'99) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, in 1988.","Currently, he is a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor.

This paper proposes an RTD-based CNN architecture and investigates its operation through driving-point-plot analysis, stability and settling time study, and circuit simulation. Full-array simulation of a 128 times 128 RTD-based CNN for several image processing functions is performed using the Quantum Spice simulator designed at the University of Michigan, where the RTD is represented in SPICE simulator by a physics based model derived by solving Schrodinger's and Poisson's equations self-consistently. A comparative study between different CNN implementations reveals that the RTD-based CNN can be designed superior to conventional CMOS technologies in terms of integration density, operating speed, and functionality.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014771","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4802402/04799247.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2014771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4802402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunneling-Based Cellular Nonlinear Network Architectures for Image Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tunneling-Based Cellular Nonlinear Network Architectures for Image Processing","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10520035","publicationDate":"April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799247/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunneling-Based Cellular Nonlinear Network Architectures for Image Processing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pmazumder-2014771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077969S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4802402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4802402","articleId":"4799247","onlineDate":"10 March 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4799284,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Z.Q.

In this paper, we propose an RRIQA algorithm based on a divisive normalization image representation. Divisive normalization has been recognized as a successful approach to model the perceptual sensitivity of biological vision. It also provides a useful image representation that significantly improves statistical independence for natural images. By using a Gaussian scale mixture statistical model of image wavelet coefficients, we compute a divisive normalization transformation (DNT) for images and evaluate the quality of a distorted image by comparing a set of reduced-reference statistical features extracted from DNT-domain representations of the reference and distorted images, respectively. This leads to a generic or general-purpose RRIQA method, in which no assumption is made about the types of distortions occurring in the image being evaluated. The proposed algorithm is cross-validated using two publicly-accessible subject-rated image databases (the UT-Austin LIVE database and the Cornell-VCL A57 database) and demonstrates good performance across a wide range of image distortions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2014497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799308","startPage":"202","endPage":"211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4799308/04799311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using Divisive Normalization-Based Image Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4799311/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using Divisive Normalization-Based Image Representation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10505233","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using Divisive Normalization-Based Image Representation","sourcePdf":"03jstsp02-zwang-2014497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104993S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4799308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"4799308","articleId":"4799311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4799315,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Ninassi","affiliation":["Thomson Corporate Research, Cesson-Sevigne, France","Institut de Recherche en Communications et Cybern\u00e9tique de Nantes (IRCCyN) UMR CNRS, \u00c9ecole Polytechnique De l''Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4799308/4799315/4799315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Ninassi graduated from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes, France, in 2005 where he received the M.S. degree in computer science, and a master of research degree in image processing.

A temporal distortion is commonly defined as the temporal evolution, or fluctuation, of the spatial distortion on a particular area which corresponds to the image of a specific object in the scene. Perception of spatial distortions over time can be largely modified by their temporal changes, such as increase or decrease in the distortions, or as periodic changes in the distortions. In this paper, we have designed a perceptual full reference video quality assessment metric by focusing on the temporal evolutions of the spatial distortions. As the perception of the temporal distortions is closely linked to the visual attention mechanisms, we have chosen to first evaluate the temporal distortion at eye fixation level. In this short-term temporal pooling, the video sequence is divided into spatio-temporal segments in which the spatio-temporal distortions are evaluated, resulting in spatio-temporal distortion maps. Afterwards, the global quality score of the whole video sequence is obtained by the long-term temporal pooling in which the spatio-temporal maps are spatially and temporally pooled. Consistent improvement over objective existing video quality assessment methods is observed. Our validation has been realized with a dataset built from video sequences of various contents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10505237","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799315/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Considering Temporal Variations of Spatial Visual Distortions in Video Quality Assessment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considering Temporal Variations of Spatial Visual Distortions in Video Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"03jstsp02-aninassi-2014806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072688S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4799308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4799308","articleId":"4799315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4799316,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Barkowsky","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4799308/4799316/4799316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcus Barkowsky received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany, in 1999.

A correlation-based motion vector processing method is proposed to detect and correct those unreliable motion vectors by explicitly considering motion vector correlation in the motion vector reliability classification, motion vector correction, and frame interpolation stages. Since our method gradually corrects unreliable motion vectors based on their reliability, we can effectively discover the areas where no motion is reliable to be used, such as occlusions and deformed structures. We also propose an adaptive frame interpolation scheme for the occlusion areas based on the analysis of their surrounding motion distribution. As a result, the interpolated frames using the proposed scheme have clearer structure edges and ghost artifacts are also greatly reduced. Experimental results show that our interpolated results have better visual quality than other methods. In addition, the proposed scheme is robust even for those video sequences that contain multiple and fast motions.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2010206","startPage":"740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4799361/04799363.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2010206","endPage":"752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation-Based Motion Vector Processing With Adaptive Interpolation Scheme for Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Correlation-Based Motion Vector Processing With Adaptive Interpolation Scheme for Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4799363/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10505427","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","pubMedId":"19278918","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation-Based Motion Vector Processing With Adaptive Interpolation Scheme for Motion-Compensated Frame Interpolation","sourcePdf":"18tip03-ahuang-2010206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4799361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4799361","articleId":"4799363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799375,"authors":[{"name":"Rony Ferzli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4799361/4799375/4799375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rony Ferzli received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

The key in the approach is to exploit the multichannel redundancy of the defocusing operation to create a linear subspace, where the unknown perfectly focused image resides, expressed in terms of a known basis formed from the given defocused image. A unique solution for the perfectly focused image is then directly determined through a linear algebraic formulation by invoking an additional image support condition. The MCA approach is found to be computationally efficient and robust and does not require prior assumptions about the SAR scene used in existing methods. In addition, the vector-space formulation of MCA allows sharpness metric optimization to be easily incorporated within the restoration framework as a regularization term. We present experimental results characterizing the performance of MCA in comparison with conventional autofocus methods and discuss the practical implementation of the technique. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10505435","pubMedId":"19278922","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MCA: A Multichannel Approach to SAR Autofocus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCA: A Multichannel Approach to SAR Autofocus","sourcePdf":"18tip04-rmorrison-2012883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052847S","chronDate":"April  2009","isNumber":"4799361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4799379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4799380,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Center of Automation Research and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","Goldman Sachs and Company, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4799361/4799380/4799380-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Li (S'04) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, in 2006.","During his study at the University of Maryland, he published papers on fingerprinting humans and vehicles for persistent tracking through camera networks, structure from planar motion, and geometric transform based appearance modeling and image segmentation.

The proposed GeT is a functional of an image intensity function and a region indicator function derived from a closed contour. It can be designed to combine the shape and appearance information at different resolutions and to generate models invariant to deformation, articulation, or occlusion. By choosing appropriate functionals and region indicator functions, the GeT unifies Radon transform, trace transform, and a class of image warpings. By varying the region indicator and the types of features used for appearance modeling, five novel types of GeTs are introduced and applied to fingerprinting the appearance inside a contour. They include the GeTs based on a level set, shape matching, feature curves, and the GeT invariant to occlusion, and a multiresolution GeT (MRGeT). Applications of GeT to pedestrian identity recognition, human body part segmentation, and image synthesis are illustrated. The proposed approach produces promising results when applied to fingerprinting the appearance of a human and body parts despite the presence of nonrigid deformations and articulated motion.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2011381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"889","endPage":"902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2011381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799361","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4799361/04799380.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Shape","Fingerprint recognition","Humans","Deformable models","Biological system modeling","Level set","Image recognition","Image segmentation","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","image resolution","image segmentation","Radon transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["appearance modeling","geometric transform","image intensity function","region indicator function","closed contour","Radon transform","trace transform","image warping","pedestrian identity recognition","human body part segmentation","image synthesis","fingerprinting","level set method","shape matching","feature curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Appearance model","geometric transform (GeT)","human body part segmentation","image warping","interpolation","invariant feature","level set","multiresolution","pedestrian identity recognition","Radon transform","shape matching","trace transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Appearance Modeling Using a Geometric Transform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799380/","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4799380/","accessionNumber":"10517096","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"19278925","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 March 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Appearance Modeling Using a Geometric Transform","sourcePdf":"18tip04-szhou-2011381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227357S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4799361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4799361","articleId":"4799380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4799402,"authors":[{"name":"Noel Sharkey","affiliation":["Dept.

The Cognitive Map can be thought of as a centralized information space for connected components to contribute both internal and environmental state information. We leverage several successfully proven concepts such as blackboard architectures and publish- subscribe based messaging to develop a flexible robot architecture that exhibits fault-tolerance, easily substituted components, and provides support for different structural paradigms such as subsumption, sense-plan-act and three-tier architectures. Our multicomponent distributed system has system components that are loosely coupled via message-passing and/or continuous data streams. This architecture was implemented on the humanoid robot ASIMO manufactured by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. We review various forms of communication middleware and component models. The \"Architecture\" section provides an overview of our architecture and considerations in its design.

the rotor within the stator during the assembly process. Therefore the machines are operated with an eccentricity that, though small, is not negligible, and is the cause of undesirable effects: considerable unbalanced magnetic pulls, vibrations, additional losses. It is therefore important to assess the eccentricity and even more to check its trend in case of any stator or rotor deformations in order to guarantee a safe operation and to prevent any serious damage at an early stage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An innovative inductive air-gap monitoring for large low speed hydro-generators","publicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799905","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796893/4799813/04799905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An innovative inductive air-gap monitoring for large low speed hydro-generators","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799905/","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10519952","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An innovative inductive air-gap monitoring for large low speed hydro-generators","confLoc":"Vilamoura, Portugal","sourcePdf":"087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040881S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796893","isNumber":"4799813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796893","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4799813","articleId":"4799905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4799960,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Only few sets of data: voltage, current, power and speed or slip, measured in the motor in-situ, are utilized. With these data, genetic algorithms techniques, applying the method of symmetrical components of voltage and considering parameters variations (especially in the rotor) related to the effect of negative sequence voltage system, are developed. Once the parameters are known, it is possible to obtain the estimated efficiency.

In the course of a joint research project the 3D-magnetic field within the end-winding region of a 300 MVA hydropower generator was calculated. Due to the large dimensions of the machine, complex end-portion design of the stator core and a fractional slot winding the calculation case became typically very large. Despite using most powerful FEM software the calculation could be realized only by applying appropriate simplifications and strategies for minimizing the number of finite elements. The paper describes the method for building up the 3D-FEM model of the generator and the simplifications applied. Since the quality of the calculation results is essentially determined by the simplifications incorporated into the calculation model the paper is focused on the experience with appropriate simplifications and their verification for making the case computable. Quite a few publications give the wrong impression that application of FEM methods unavoidably leads to correct results at least for large calculation cases. Quite often FEM calculation results are simply offered without disclosing the applied simplifications. However, due to our experience results become trustworthy only in case the simplifications applied are documented and justified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience with model simplifications for making a large FEM calculation case computable","publicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799969","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796893/4799813/04799969.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Experience with model simplifications for making a large FEM calculation case computable","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799969/","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10545061","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience with model simplifications for making a large FEM calculation case computable","confLoc":"Vilamoura, Portugal","sourcePdf":"151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032658S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796893","isNumber":"4799813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796893","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4799813","articleId":"4799969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4799973,"authors":[{"name":"E.

By simulating electrical (shorted turn in the rotor winding) and mechanical defect (rotor eccentricity), and comparing their signature with the healthy machine or with some non modified part of the curves, it is possible to determine the type, the severity, and even the location of the defect.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4796893/4799813/04799973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines","doi":"10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICELMACH.2008.4799973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4799973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flux density curves variations using an FEM model for turbo-generators diagnostics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Magnetic flux","Magnetostatics","Coils","Performance evaluation","Magnetic fields","Equations","Rotors","Density measurement","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","finite element analysis","machine testing","machine windings","rotors","turbogenerators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flux density curves","FEM model","turbogenerators diagnostics","on-line tool","shorted turn detection","rotor winding","airgap flux","defect detection","mechanical defect","rotor eccentricity","defect location"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4799973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Flux density curves variations using an FEM model for turbo-generators diagnostics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4799973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10545065","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux density curves variations using an FEM model for turbo-generators diagnostics","confLoc":"Vilamoura, Portugal","sourcePdf":"155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045849S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4796893","isNumber":"4799813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4796893","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4799813","articleId":"4799973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
